Advancing disaster policies by integrating dynamic adaptive behaviour in risk assessments using an agent-based modelling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						adaptation; flood risk; agent-based models	FLOOD PROTECTION; SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER FLOODS; BENEFITS; REDUCTION; INSURANCE; COSTS	Recent floods in the United States and Asia again highlighted their devastating effects, and without investments in adaptation, the future impact of floods will continue to increase. Key to making accurate flood-risk projections are assessments of how disaster-risk reduction (DRR) measures reduce risk and how much risk remains after adaptation. Current flood-risk-assessment models are ill-equipped to address this, as they assume a static adaptation path, implying that vulnerability will remain constant. We present a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates different types of adaptive behaviour of governments (proactive and reactive) and households (rational and boundedly rational) in a continental-scale risk-assessment framework for river flooding in the European Union. Our methodology demonstrates how flood risk and adaptation might develop, indicates how DRR policies can steer decisions towards optimal behaviour, and indicates how much residual risk remains that has to be covered by risk-transfer mechanisms. We find that the increase in flood risk due to climate change may be largely offset by adaptation decisions. Moreover, we illustrate that adaptation by households may be more influential for risk reduction than government protection in the short term. The results highlight the importance of integrating behavioural methods from social sciences with quantitative models from the natural sciences, as advocated by both fields.	[Haer, Toon; Botzen, W.

We conducted semi-structured interviews in 2017-2018 with 18 Detroit residents experiencing recurrent household flooding. We used standard qualitative coding analysis to generate 30 theoretically- and in vivo- derived themes related to flood experience, socioeconomic and health factors, and household, community, and policy interventions for reducing environmental exposures before, during, and after flood events. Snowball sampling yielded interviewees across both high- and low-risk areas for flood events, indicating vulnerability may be widespread and undocumented in formal ways. Residents described exposure to diverse risk factors for chronic and infectious diseases, particularly for seniors and young children, and emphasized stressors associated with repeated economic loss and uncertainty. Opinions varied on the adequacy, responsibility, and equity of local and federal relief funding and programs. We expand knowledge of flood-related vulnerability, offer innovative suggestions for risk communication based on residents' experiences, and recommend additional research for documenting patterns of recurrent flooding and response, even for precipitation events that are not characterized as extreme or disaster-level in the media or by agencies. These findings should guide local public health, emergency preparedness, sustainability, water and sewage, and community leaders in post-industrial cities.

With the increased demand for land, the general trend has been the loss of forest land to agriculture and set-tlements. These changes have altered the water balance components through enhanced or reduced evaporation, peak flow, flooding, and river morphology. The aim of this review paper is to provide a meta-analysis on the effects of spatiotemporal changes in climate and LULC on river hydro-morphology in the tropics. Following a systematic search, 60 case studies were identified, of which the majority (68%) experienced forest loss due to agricultural and urban expansion, resulting in increased streamflow, surface flow, and total water yield and decreased ET and groundwater recharge. 12% of the case studies showed the impacts of LULCC on channel morphology features through sediment transport and riverbank erosion. Results from this study show limited correlation between LULCC and hydrological variables, indicating that there are likely other factors controlling hydrological processes. Catchment heterogeneity including soil and topography play an important role. Based on studies that project these changes into the future, similar trends are expected over the next decades, with dif-ferences based on LU and climate scenarios. There are still limited studies on river hydro-morphology responses to LULCC and CC in the tropics despite the major changes taking place there. In light of future changes, more studies are needed to improve our understanding.

J	Jin, HY; Chen, XH; Zhong, RD; Duan, K				Jin, Haoyu; Chen, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ruida; Duan, Kai			Frequency analysis of extreme precipitation in different regions of the Huaihe River Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						extreme precipitation; frequency analysis; inconsistency; L-moments; the Huaihe River Basin	CLIMATE-CHANGE; L-MOMENTS; DISASTERS; DROUGHT	Affected by climate change and human activities, the frequency and uncertainty of extreme precipitation have shown an increasing trend, which has brought great challenges to the prevention of flood disasters. The Huaihe River Basin (HRB) is located at the junction of northern and southern China and is more susceptible to climate change. In order to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in the HRB, in this study, the L-moments method was used to analyse the regional frequency distribution of the annual precipitation (YP), the maximum one-day rainfall (RM1day), the maximum five-day rainfall (RM5day) and the maximum 15-day rainfall (RM15day) in the HRB. The results show that the HRB can be divided into five sub-zones on the basis of the division of natural sub-basins to ensure regional consistency. The accuracy of quantile estimation will decrease as the return periods increase. When the return period is less than 100 years, the relative root mean square error (RMSE) can be guaranteed to be relatively small, and the cumulative RMSE is less than 0.3. However, after the return period is greater than 100 years, the 90% confidence interval of the quantile estimate increases rapidly, indicating that the estimated quantile error increased. The northwestern part of the HRB may experience extreme annual precipitation, which is different from the normal precipitation distribution. The extreme precipitation in Zone 1, Zone 2-2 and Zone 4 is not only strong but also has a large increase speed, making these areas the key focus zones for flood control and anti-logging. This study can provide important reference for the prediction and prevention of extreme precipitation in the HRB.

Heat, cold, and floods: exploring farmers' motivations to adapt to extreme weather events in the Terai region of Nepal	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Cold spells; Extreme temperatures; Heat waves; Intended adaptation; Protection motivation theory	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; RISK PERCEPTIONS; DETERMINANTS; IMPACTS; LEVEL; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; HOUSEHOLDS; CAPACITY	Smallholder farmers in Nepal are vulnerable to climate change-related extreme weather events. Adaptation in the agriculture sector is needed to mitigate social, economic, and ecological impacts from increasing levels of hazard activity. To examine this issue, a household survey of 350 farmers in the Terai region of Nepal was carried out to assess farmers' risk perceptions towards three common extreme weather events (floods, cold spells, and heat waves) and to explore their intended responses to cope with future impacts. The intended common adaptation strategies include changes in farm management, seeking off-farm employment, emergency management planning, purchasing crop insurance, and the raising of awareness. Threat appraisal is the strongest predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted in response to slow-onset hazards (heat waves and cold spells), while coping appraisal is the major predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted to mitigate flood risk, a rapid onset hazard. Crop insurance and off-farm employment are farmers' most preferred flood adaptation strategies, while crop insurance is the most preferred adaptation strategy for heat waves and cold spells. Other variables such as the number of past implemented strategies, experience with extreme events, community organisation membership, and access to credit and extension services were also significantly associated with farmers' choices for adaptation strategies in response to the three extreme events. This information can be used to tailor community-centred communication about potential threats from different extreme weather events and government technical and financial support, which will be crucial for farmers to adapt effectively to climate change-related weather extremes.

CO<sub>2</sub> utilization: Turning greenhouse gas into fuels and valuable products	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; CO2 utilization; Desalination; Algal biofuel; Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas	MICROALGAL BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; DIMETHYL ETHER PRODUCTION; ALGAL BIOFUEL PRODUCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; POWER-PLANT; WASTE-WATER; CATALYTIC METHANATION; METHANOL PRODUCTION; RECENT PROGRESS	This study critically reviews the recent developments and future opportunities pertinent to the conversion of CO2 as a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) to fuels and valuable products. CO2 emissions have reached an alarming level of around 410 ppm and have become the primary driver of global warming and climate change leading to devastating events such as droughts, hurricanes, torrential rains, floods, tornados and wildfires across the world. These events are responsible for thousands of deaths and have adversely affected the economic development of many countries, loss of billions of dollars, across the globe. One of the promising choices to tackle this issue is carbon sequestration by pre- and post-combustion processes and oxyfuel combustion. The captured CO2 can be converted into fuels and valuable products, including methanol, dirnethyl ether (DINE), and methane (CH4). The efficient use of the sequestered CO2 for the desalinization might be critical in overcoming water scarcity and energy issues in developing countries. Using the sequestered CO2 to produce algae in combination with waste-water, and producing biofuels is among the promising strategies. Many methods, like direct combustion, fermentation, transesterification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion (AD), and gasification, can be used for the conversion of algae into biofuel. Direct air capturing (DAC) is another productive technique for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into various useful energy resources like CH4. These methods can effectively tackle the issues of climate change, water security, and energy crises. However, future research is required to make these conversion methods cost-effective and commercially applicable.	[Anwar, M. N.; Fayyaz, A.; Baqar, M.; Yasar, A.; Nizami, A.

Mangroves play a very protective role against some of these coastal hazards. The primary aim of the study was to estimate wave energy attenuation by mangrove vegetation using modeling, and to validate the model results with measurements conducted off Mumbai coast, where a mangrove forest is present. Wave measurements were carried out from 5-8 August 2015 at three locations in a transect normal to the coast using surface-mounted pressure-level sensors in spring tide conditions. The measured data presented wave height attenuation of the order of 52%. Model set-up and sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand the model performance with respect to vegetation parameters. It was observed that wave attenuation increases with an increase in drag coefficient, vegetation density, and stem diameter. For a typical set-up in the Mumbai coastal region having a vegetation density of 0.175 per m(2), stem diameter of 0.3 m, and drag coefficient varying from 0.4 to 1.5, the model reproduced attenuation ranging from 49% to 55%, which matches reasonably well with the measured data. Spectral analysis performed for the cases with and without vegetation very clearly portrays energy dissipation in the vegetation area.

Social cohesion and passive adaptation in relation to climate change and disease	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Adaptive capacity; Vulnerability; Model; Social network; Infectious disease; Environmental change	DIARRHEAL DISEASE; NETWORK STRUCTURE; VULNERABILITY; TRANSMISSION; INDICATORS; PATHOGENS; ENVIRONMENT; COMMUNITIES; STRATEGIES; WATER	Climate change affects biophysical processes related to the transmission of many infectious diseases, with potentially adverse consequences for the health of communities. While our knowledge of biophysical associations between meteorological factors and disease is steadily improving, our understanding of the social processes that shape adaptation to environmental perturbations lags behind. Using computational modeling methods, we explore the ways in which social cohesion can affect adaptation of disease prevention strategies when communities are exposed to different environmental scenarios that influence transmission pathways for diseases such as diarrhea. We developed an agent-based model in which household agents can choose between two behavioral strategies that offer different levels of protection against environmentally mediated disease transmission. One behavioral strategy is initially set as more protective, leading households to adopt it widely, but its efficacy is sensitive to variable weather conditions and stressors such as floods or droughts that modify the disease transmission system. The efficacy of the second strategy is initially moderate relative to the first and is insensitive to environmental changes. We examined how social cohesion (defined as average number of household social network connections) influences health outcomes when households attempt to identify an optimal strategy by copying the behaviors of socially connected neighbors who seem to have adapted successfully in the past. Our simulation experiments suggest that high-cohesion communities are able to rapidly disseminate the initially optimal behavioral strategy compared to low-cohesion communities. This rapid and pervasive change, however, decreases behavioral diversity; i.e., once a high cohesion community settles on a strategy, most or all households adopt that behavior. Following environmental changes that reduce the efficacy of the initially optimal strategy, rendering it suboptimal relative to the alternative strategy, high-cohesion communities can fail to adapt. As a result, despite faring better early in the course of computational experiments, high-cohesion communities may ultimately experience worse outcomes. In the face of uncertainty in predicting future environmental stressors due to climate change, strategies to improve effective adaptation to optimal disease prevention strategies should balance between intervention efforts that promote protective behaviors based on current scientific understanding and the need to guard against the crystallization of inflexible norms. Developing generalizable models allows us to integrate a wide range of theories and multiple datasets pertaining to the relationship between social mechanisms and adaptation, which can provide further understanding of future climate change impacts. Models such as the one we present can generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of adaptation events and suggest specific points of measurement to assess the impact of these mechanisms. They can be incorporated as modules within predictive simulations for specific socio-ecological contexts.

Disentangling direct and indirect effects of extreme events on coastal wetland communities	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						coastal freshwater wetlands; community dynamics; extreme weather events; multispecies occupancy; structural equation models; wetland-breeding amphibians	ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITIES; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; DISTURBANCE; DIVERSITY; SALINITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	One of the primary ways in which climate change will impact coastal freshwater wetlands is through changes in the frequency, intensity, timing and distribution of extreme weather events. Disentangling the direct and indirect mechanisms of population- and community-level responses to extreme events is vital to predicting how species composition of coastal wetlands will change under future conditions. We extended static structural equation modelling approaches to incorporate system dynamics in a multi-year multispecies occupancy model to quantify the effects of extreme weather events on a coastal freshwater wetland system. We used data from an 8-year study (2009-2016) on St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, USA, to quantify species-specific and community-level changes in amphibian and fish occupancy associated with two flooding events in 2012 and 2013. We examine how physical changes to the landscape, including potential changes in salinity and increased wetland connectivity, may have contributed to or exacerbated the effects of these extreme weather events on the biota of isolated coastal wetlands. We provide evidence that the primary effects of flooding on the amphibian community were through indirect mechanisms via changes in the composition of the sympatric fish community that may have had lethal (i.e. through direct predation) or non-lethal (i.e. through direct or indirect competitive interactions) effects. In addition, we have shown that amphibian species differed in their sensitivity to direct flooding effects and indirect changes in the fish community and wetland-specific conductance, which led to variable responses across the community. These effects led to the overall decline in amphibian species richness from 2009 to 2016, suggesting that wetland-breeding amphibian communities on St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge may not be resilient to predicted changes in coastal disturbance regimes because of climate change. Understanding both direct and indirect effects, as well as species interactions, is important for predicting the effects of a changing climate on individual species, communities and ecosystems.

Land degradation has reduced ecosystem services provisioning, released carbon from disturbed soils into the atmosphere, and significantly diminished resilience to climate change. Private land managers in the region have developed methods to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. Land managers have used rock detention structures (RDS), technology adapted from traditional Indigenous practices in the region, as a tool for reversing desertification and watershed degradation. The structures were installed primarily for erosion control and water management, but they have had positive impacts on multiple biophysical systems. In this study, we analyze watershed-scale installation of RDS as a nature-based solution for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Case studies include four properties that offer examples of structures that have been in place over a period ranging from 1 to 40 years. We reviewed journal articles and other studies conducted at the four sites, supplemented with interviews, to catalogue the nature-based solutions provided by RDS. This study documents positive impacts on overall stream flow, reduction in peak runoff during inundation events, and increased sedimentation, which increase resilience to drought, erosion, and flooding. Data suggest potential impacts for climate change mitigation, though further research is needed. In addition, results suggest that watershed restoration with RDS offers a host of co-benefits, including an increase in biodiversity and wildlife abundance, an increase in vegetative cover, and increased surface water provisioning over time to support the land-based livelihoods of downstream neighbors. In the discussion, we consider barriers to replication and scalability using the strategy of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as a guiding framework, discussing issues of awareness, legislation and policy, technical capacity, finance, and gaps in knowledge.

This study investigated climate and hydrological regimes of the high-altitude Indus basin for the historical period and extreme scenarios of future climate during 21st century. Improved datasets of precipitation and temperature were developed and forced to a fully-distributed physically-based energy-balance Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model to simulate the water balance at regional and sub-basin scale. Relative to historical baseline, the results revealed highly contrasting signals of climate and hydrological regime changes. Against an increase of 0.6 degrees C during the last 40 years, the median annual air temperature is projected to increase further between 0.8 and 5.7 degrees C by the end of 21st century. Similarly, a decline of 11.9% in annual precipitation is recorded, but future projections are highly conflicting and spatially variable. The Karakoram region is anticipated to receive more precipitation, while SW-Hindukush and parts of W-Himalayan region may experience decline in precipitation. The Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate version-5 (MIR005) generally shows increases, while Max Planck Institute Earth System Model at base resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) indicates decreases in precipitation and river inflows under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 2.6. 4.5 and 8.5. Indus-Tarbela inflows are more likely to increase compared to Kabul, Jhelum and Chenab river inflows. Substantial increase in the magnitudes of peak flows and one-month earlier attainment is projected for all river gauges. High flows are anticipated to increase under most scenarios, while low flows may decrease for MPI-FSM-LR in Jhelum, Chenab and Kabul river basins. Hence, hydrological extremes are likely to be intensified. Critical modifications in the strategies and action plans for hydropower generation, construction and operation of storage reservoirs, irrigation withdrawals, flood control and drought management will be required to optimally manage water resources in the basin.

Our objective was to explore the responses of soil seed bank germination to climate-related environments along geographic gradients. We collected seed banks in baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico Coast in the United States, which have distinct temperature and/or precipitation gradients, and germinated themin a greenhouse. The frequency, richness and seed density of species germinated from the seed bank were compared between various geographic locations, experimental water regimes (saturated, flooded) and wetland types (tidal, non-tidal and inland swamps). We also analyzed the relationship of seed density to the environment by using a Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMDS) model. Sixty-one species germinated from the seed bank, differing in pattern by geographic location, experimental water regime and wetland type. The foundation species (i.e., T. distichum and Cephalanthus occidentalis) germinated with a niche affinity for the northern part of the latitudinal gradient (Tennessee and Illinois) and these species may shift northward with climate change. Some species had higher seed density in the locations thatwere subject to more persistent drought conditions (e.g., Texas) including Cyperus rotundus and Gratiola virginiana, indicating that these species may be better adapted to sites with high temperature and lowprecipitation. In contrast, certain species including Saururus cernuus and Ludwigia palustriswere present throughout the range of these gradients, and somay be more resilient to any future climate shifts. We found that the regeneration potential of baldcypress swampsmight be altered by changes in local and climate environment because of nuances of responses of seed banks to climates along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Our study can help predict vegetation regeneration potential to climate change environments depending on the ability of these species to disperse and maintain seed banks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the anticipated impacts of climate change in terms of frequency and intensity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and floods) on hydrological systems across regions could be substantially different. This study therefore aims to assess the impacts of climate change on the streamflow of a large river basin located in central Australia (Cooper CreekBulloo River Basin). Modified version of the hydrological model Hydrologiska ByrAns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) was used in this study to generate daily streamflow. This model was first calibrated (2001-2010) and then validated for two independent periods (1993-1997 and 2011-2015). The model depicted a good performance in simulating observed streamflow. Climate projection data from multiple general circulation models (ACCESSIO, CanESM2, CESM1-CAM5, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, MIR005, NorESM1-M, ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3.6, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2, MIR005, MPI-ESM-LR, and NorESM1-M) in various forms (raw, statistically downscaled, dynamically downscaled, and bias adjusted) were considered in this study. Results showed that three high resolution dynamically downscaled and bias adjusted models (ACCESS1-3, CNRM-CM5, and MPI-ESM-LR) from Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) dataset (v1.0.2) have better performance than other models considered, that is, in terms of capturing observed precipitation over the basin. Future climate projections of ensemble of these three models forced with RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios were then used to generate streamflow for 2050s (2040-2069) and 2080s (2070-2099). Results of the study indicated that mean annual precipitation was projected to decrease by up to -8% in 2050s and temperature was projected to increase by up to 4.66 degrees C in 2080s under the average and extreme emission scenarios, respectively. Mean annual, mean seasonal (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November), and mean monthly streamflow were projected to decrease under different emission scenarios in 2050s and 2080s. These results indicate decreased water availability in the future as well as water cycle intensification. These changes in streamflow might have impacts on agriculture, natural ecosystem, and could lead to water restrictions. The outcome of this study can directly feed into frameworks for sustainable management of water resources and support adaptation strategies that rely on science and policy to improve water resources allocation in the region.

After floods and earthquakes, debris flows are the most devastating natural hazard in the world. The effects of debris flow on human life and built environments necessitate reconsidering current infrastructure planning, engineering, and risk management practices. Hence, the vulnerability of elements at risk is critical for effective risk reduction systems. Therefore, this article reviews the existing physical vulnerability approach of infrastructure, particularly building toward debris flow hazards in the last 20 years. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the vulnerability assessment and their quantification techniques have also been discussed in detail. It was found that matrices, curves, and indicators have been extensively used for vulnerability assessment approaches in the last two decades. However, if aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are not quantified or conserved in the vulnerability assessment process, it makes the system inefficient and unreliable. Moreover, data requirements, strengths, and weaknesses of approaches presented herein are highlighted with case studies. Finally, a thorough discussion on future needs in the field of risk assessment methodologies is highlighted by considering uncertainties into account.

Research on global warming, as well as on its possible economic and environmental consequences, has spread over the last 20 years. Diffused changes in trends have been stated by several authors throughout the world, with different developments observed depending on the continent. Following a period of approximately 40 days of almost continuous rain that occurred from October to November 2019 across the Italian territory and caused several hazards (e.g., floods and landslides), a relevant question for decision-makers and civil protection actors emerged regarding the relative frequencies of given rainfall events in the Warning Hazard Zones (WHZs) of Italy. The derived products of this work could answer this question for both weather and hydrogeological operators thanks to the frequency and spatio-temporal distribution analyses conducted on 10-year daily rainfall data over the entire Italian territory. This work aspires to be an additional tool used to analyse events that have occurred, providing further information for a better understanding of the probability of occurrence and distribution of future events.

In Nigeria, flooding remains the most widespread environmental disaster with the population of 200 million suffering numerous threats from perennial flooding. Port Harcourt in Southern Nigeria experiences annual flooding on a significant scale. While research has linked the flooding in Port Harcourt to poor urban planning, little research has engaged with planning professionals to investigate this relationship. This paper fills this gap. It explores how urban planning is linked to flooding in Port Harcourt and reports on qualitative research undertaken with five urban planners in Port Harcourt. The findings affirm that poor planning and/or lack of compliance with planning regulations are the main factors contributing to the flooding of Port Harcourt. The urban planners gave their expert opinions on how to control the flooding and unanimously agreed that improved planning practices could control the endemic flooding problem in the city. This implies that the government needs to work more closely with urban planners and other stakeholders to effectively control and find a lasting solution to the flooding problem in Port Harcourt city.

Kilometer-scale modeling projects a tripling of Alaskan convective storms in future climate	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Precipitation; Convection-permitting modeling; Convective systems; Mesoscale convective systems; Climate change	PRECIPITATION; WEATHER; SYSTEMS; INTENSIFICATION; SIMULATIONS; DIVISIONS; INCREASES; FORECASTS; TRENDS	Convective storms produce heavier downpours and become more intense with climate change. Such changes could be even amplified in high-latitudes since the Arctic is warming faster than any other region in the world and subsequently moistening. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of global warming on intense thunderstorms in high latitude continental regions, where they can produce flash flooding or ignite wildfires. We use a model with kilometer-scale grid spacing to simulate Alaska's climate under present and end of the century high emission scenario conditions. The current climate simulation is able to capture the frequency and intensity of hourly precipitation compared to rain gauge data. We apply a precipitation tracking algorithm to identify intense, organized convective systems, which are projected to triple in frequency and extend to the northernmost regions of Alaska under future climate conditions. Peak rainfall rates in the core of the storms will intensify by 37% in line with atmospheric moisture increases. These results could have severe impacts on Alaska's economy and ecology since floods are already the costliest natural disaster in central Alaska and an increasing number of thunderstorms could result in more wildfires ignitions.

Agricultural policies against invasive species generate contrasting outcomes for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						rice; apple snail; greenhouse gases; waterbirds; Ebro Delta; wetlands	RICE FIELDS; DIVERSITY; EMISSIONS; STRAW	Direct consequences of biological invasions on biodiversity and the environment have been largely documented. Yet collateral indirect effects mediated by changes in agri-environmental policies aimed at combating invasions remain little explored. Here we assessed the effects of recent changes in water management in rice farming, which are aimed at buffering the impact of the invasive apple snail (Pomacea maculata, Lamarck) on greenhouse gas emissions and diversity of waterbird communities. We used observational data from a 2-year field monitoring (2015-2016) performed at the Ebro Delta regional scale. We found that drying rice fields reduced methane emission rates by 82% (2015) and 51% (2016), thereby reflecting the contribution of rice farming to climate change. However, there was a marked reduction (75% in 2015 and 57% in 2016) in waterbird diversity in dry fields compared with flooded fields, thus suggesting that post-invasion policies might hinder biodiversity conservation. Our results highlight the need for accounting for potential collateral effects during the policy decision-making process to design efficient agricultural management plans that lessen undesirable agri-environmental outcomes.

RFD remains high in some Asian and African regions, suggesting a limit to flood adaptation there. The risk of river flooding is expected to increase with climate change and socioeconomic development, and therefore additional protection measures are required to reduce the potential for increased flood damage. While studies have investigated the effectiveness of adaptation measures to reduce flood risks, none has evaluated residual flood damage (RFD), which reflects the projected increase in damage under intensive adaptation. Here we evaluate RFD under several adaptation objectives using an inundation model incorporating damage estimates and a cost-benefit analysis, and estimate that China, India and Latin American countries can achieve higher levels of flood protection that will reduce RFD even under extreme scenarios. However, a high RFD (exceeding 0.1% of subnational administrative gross domestic product) remains, especially in eastern China, northern India and central Africa. RFD could be reduced with shorter construction periods or lower adaptation costs, implying the need for immediate and appropriate adaptation actions, including enhanced financial support for high-risk regions.

Vulnerability assessment has emerged to understand various dimensions and effects of natural hazards on human settlements. This study has proposed a modified multidimensional vulnerability assessment method. Relevant indicators have been quantified through indices under six dimensions of vulnerability, i.e., social, economic, physical, institutional, attitudinal, and gender. This study introduces 'gender' as a sixth non-static dimension of vulnerability. The model was operationalized for three rural communities from the Hunza-Nagar districts in the Pakistani Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. The results revealed that communities are highly vulnerable to natural hazards in all dimensions. Low economic status, inadequate infrastructure, poor risk perception, and gender-exclusive plans are responsible for high vulnerabilities. Overall, this study contributes to an updated methodology, which can be implemented in other hazard-prone mountain communities at national and regional levels.

Because it is essential for citizens to contribute to their own protection, it is increasingly necessary to take their knowledge and perceptions into account. Two studies have been conducted to identify the factors that could explain protective behavior regarding coastal erosion and flooding risks: a qualitative study using interviews with 32 inhabitants of municipalities exposed to coastal risks, and a quantitative study using questionnaires with 237 participants exposed to coastal erosion (N = 116) and coastal flooding (N = 121). Thematic content and statistical analysis (multiple linear regression) have been used. The results indicate that flooding is considered a personal risk with heightened involvement, and thus necessitates personal action for self-protection. Erosion appears to be a collective risk, impacting all inhabitants, as well as being slower and easier to anticipate. The physical characteristics of the phenomenon will thus determine the dynamics and functioning of social knowledge on risk assessment and on the motivation to protect oneself.

Previous research has not clearly distinguished the flood-mitigation effects of green infrastructure at the local scale due to its complex range of functions including socioeconomic benefits, ecosystem services, and amenity value. Using data on 3768 housing sales from 2009 to 2019 in Hong Kong, we employ a difference-in-differences framework to examine the effect of green infrastructure on perceptions of flood risk mitigation, with housing prices as a proxy for risk perception. We find a positive effect of green infrastructure on the value of nearby housing. The effect does not exist in apartment units on higher floors, however. This vertical discrepancy further suggests that the observed pricing effects are due to green infrastructure's capacity to reduce perceptions of flood risk. By contrast, properties near conventional gray infrastructure show no evidence of such effects. The results thus provide quantitative evidence that supports the ongoing shift toward green infrastructure as a form of climate change adaptation.

Response of Extreme Rainfall for Landfalling Tropical Cyclones Undergoing Extratropical Transition to Projected Climate Change: Hurricane Irene (2011)	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						tropical cyclone rainfall; climate change; extratropical transition	EASTERN UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION DISTRIBUTION; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; INTENSITY; EVOLUTION; FREQUENCY; IMPACT; FLOOD; CYCLE	Extreme rainfall and flooding associated with landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) have large societal impacts, both in fatalities and economic losses. This study examines the response of TC rainfall to climate change projected under future anthropogenic greenhouse emissions, focusing on Hurricane Irene, which produced severe flooding across the Northeastern United States in August 2011. Numerical simulations are made with the Weather Research and Forecasting model, placing Irene in the present-day climate and one projected for the end of 21st century climate represented by Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Projected future changes to surface and atmospheric temperature lead to a storm rainfall increase of 32% relative to the control run, exceeding the rate expected by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation given a similar to 3-K lower atmospheric warming. Analyses of the atmospheric water balance highlight contributions to the increase in rainfall rate from both increased circulation strength and atmospheric moisture. Storm rainfall rate shows contrasting response to global warming during TC and extratropical transition periods. During the TC phase, Irene shows a significant increase of storm rainfall rate in inner core regions. This increase shifts to outer rainbands as Irene undergoes extratropical transition, collocated with the maximum tangential wind increase and the change of secondary circulation strength. Changes of storm track from the control run to global warming projections play a role in the change of spatial rainfall pattern. Distinct roles of surface and atmospheric warming in storm rainfall and structure changes are also examined. Plain Language Summary Landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) can undergo the process of extratropical transition, through which storm structure and dynamics transform, enabling them to persist (and extend their hazards) to middle- and high-latitude regions, which have large-scale conditions hostile to TCs. These so-called post-TCs can produce enhanced rainfall relative to typical TCs, leading to more severe flood hazards. For example, Hurricane Irene (2011) produced extreme flooding along the East Coast of the United States and Canada, especially in mid-Atlantic regions and New England. Future changes of post-TCs have strong implications for flood risk assessment and management. To provide new insights on this issue, we conducted a case study focusing on Hurricane Irene (2011) by placing Irene in a projected warmer climate, which allows us to examine aspects of the influence of climate change on future storm rainfall rate. Irene produced heavier rainfall in a warming climate than the current climate. This increase is mainly concentrated in the inner core region at the TC phase and shifts to outer regions at the post-TC phase. The magnitude of Irene rainfall rate increase exceeds the rate of water vapor increase under the warmer climate, highlighting increased flood risk in the future.	[Liu, M.; Yang, L.; Smith, J.

Jun; Rousseau, Alain N.; Zhang, Guangxin			Can the combining of wetlands with reservoir operation reduce the risk of future floods and droughts?	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; WATERSHED HYDROLOGY; RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE; MODEL; IMPACT; STREAMFLOW; FLOW; REPRESENTATION; PERFORMANCE	Wetlands and reservoirs are important water flow and storage regulators in a river basin; therefore, they can play a crucial role in mitigating flood and hydrological drought risks. Despite the advancement of river basin theory and modeling, our knowledge is still limited about the extent to which these two regulators could perform such a role, especially under future climate extremes. To improve our understanding, we first coupled wetlands and reservoir operations into a semi-spatially explicit hydrological model and then applied it in a case study involving a large river basin in northeast China. The projection of future floods and hydrological droughts was performed using the hydrological model during different periods (near future: 2026-2050, middle century: 2051-2075, and end century: 2076-2100) under five future climate change scenarios. We found that the risk of future floods and hydrological droughts can vary across different periods - in particular, it will experience relatively large increases and slight decreases. This large river basin will experience flood events of longer duration, with larger peak flows and volume, and of enhanced flashiness compared to the historical period. Simultaneously, the hydrological droughts will be much more frequent, with longer durations and more serious deficits. Therefore, the risk of floods and droughts will, overall, increase further under future climate change even under the combined influence of reservoirs and wetlands. These findings highlight the hydrological regulation function of wetlands and reservoirs and attest that the combining of wetlands with reservoir operation cannot fully eliminate the increasing future flood and drought risks. To improve a river basin's resilience to the risks of future climate change, we argue that the implementation of wetland restoration and the development of accurate forecasting systems for effective reservoir operation are of great importance. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a wetland-reservoir integrated modeling and assessment framework that is conducive to risk assessment of floods and hydrological droughts and that can be used for other river basins in the world.

The associated hydrological impacts especially pertaining to enhanced runoff, flood, and erosion have been well-studied, but little attention has been given to water resource availability in the humid tropics. In the light of the increasing climate extremes, this paper compared baseflow values and baseflow recession constants (K) between headwater catchments of five differing land-uses in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, namely primary forest (PF), old growth/virgin jungle reserve (VJR), twice-logged forest with 22 years regeneration (LF2), multiple-logged forest with 8 years regeneration (LF3), and oil palm plantation (OP). Hydrological and meteorological sensors and dataloggers were established in each catchment. Daily discharge was used for computing K via four estimation methods. Catchment ranks in terms of decreasing K were VJR (0.97841), LF3 (0.96692), LF2 (0.90347), PF (0.83886), and OP (0.86756). Catchment ranks in terms of decreasing annual baseflow were PF (1877 mm), LF3 (1265 mm), LF2 (812 mm), VJR (753 mm), and OP (367 mm), corresponding to 68%, 55%, 51%, 42%, and 38% of annual streamflow, respectively. Despite the low K, PF had the highest baseflow magnitude. OP had the fastest baseflow recession and lowest baseflow magnitude. Baseflow persistence decreased with increasing degree of disturbance. K showed strong association to catchment stem density instead of basal area. For dynamic catchments in this study, the K-b(3) estimator is recommended based on its lowest combination of coefficient of variation (CoV) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of prediction. For wetter catchments with even shorter recession events, the K-b(4) estimator may be considered. Regarding climate change, logging and oil palm agriculture should only be conducted after considering water resource availability. Forests (even degraded ones) should be conserved as much as possible in the headwaters for sustainable water resource.

Climate-change driven increased flood magnitudes and frequency in the British uplands: Geomorphologically informed scientific underpinning for upland flood-risk management	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						climate change; DEM differencing; flood-risk management; geomorphic work; gravel-bed river; hydrodynamic modelling; sediment management; sensitivity; terrestrial LiDAR; thresholds	RASTER-BASED MODEL; FLASH FLOODS; SEDIMENT DELIVERY; CHANNEL CHANGE; HOWGILL FELLS; EXTREME FLOOD; RIVER-BASIN; LARGE WOOD; SENSITIVITY; INUNDATION	Upland river systems in the UK are predicted to be prone to the effects of increased flood magnitudes and frequency, driven by climate change. It is clear from recent events that some headwater catchments can be very sensitive to large floods, activating the full sediment system, with implications for flood risk management further down the catchment. We provide a 15-year record of detailed morphological change on a 500-m reach of upland gravel-bed river, focusing upon the geomorphic response to an extreme event in 2007, and the recovery in the decade following. Through novel application of two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic modelling we evaluate the different energy states of pre- and post-flood morphologies of the river reach, exploring how energy state adjusts with recovery following the event. Following the 2007 flood, morphological adjustments resulted in changes to the shear stress population over the reach, resulting in higher shear stresses. Although the proportion of shear stresses in excess of those experienced using the pre-flood digital elevation model (DEM) varied over the recovery period, they remained substantially in excess of those experienced pre-2007, suggesting that there is still potential for enhanced bedload transport and morphological adjustment within the reach. Although volumetric change calculated from DEM differencing does indicate a reduction in erosion and deposition volumes in the decade following the flood, we argue that the system still has not fully recovered to the pre-flood state. We further argue that Thinhope Burn, and other similarly impacted catchments in upland environments, may not recover under the wet climatic phase currently being experienced. Hence systems like Thinhope Burn will continue to deliver large volumes of sediment further down river catchments, providing new challenges for flood risk management into the future.

This study predicts the climate change impacts on long-term precipitation trends. It deals with the analysis of observed historical (1960-2010) and arithmetic mean method in assembling precipitation from CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs) datasets for a future period (2020-2099) under four emission scenarios. Daily precipitation data of 32 weather stations in the Xijiang River Basin were provided by National Meteorological Information Centre (NMIC) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Global Climate Models (GCMs) with all four emission scenarios statistically downscaled using Bias Correction Special Disaggregation (BCSD) and applied for bias correction via Climate Change Toolkit (CCT). Nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was applied for statistical significance trend analysis while the magnitude of the trends was determined by nonparametric Sen's estimator method on a monthly scale to detect monotonic trends in annual and seasonal precipitation time series. The results showed a declined trend was observed for the past 50 years over the basin with negative values of MK test (Z) and Sen's slope Q. Historical GCMs precipitation detected decreasing trends except for NoerESM1-M which observed slightly increasing trends. The results are further validated by historical precipitation recorded by the Climate Research Unit (CRU-TS-3.1). The future scenarios will likely be positive trends for annual rainfall. Significant positive trends were observed in monsoon and winter seasons while premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons will likely be slightly downward trends. The 2040s will likely observe the lowest increase of 6.6% while the 2050s will observe the highest increase of 11.5% over the 21(st) century under future scenarios. However, due to the uncertainties in CMIP5, the future precipitation projections should be interpreted with caution. Thus, it could be concluded that the trend of change in precipitation around the Xijiang River Basin is on the increase under future scenarios. The results can be valuable to water resources and agriculture management policies, as well as the approach for managing floods and droughts under the perspective of global climate change.

Here we assesses these risks and possible response strategies for China, including estimates of present rates of RSLR, flood exposure and risk to 2050. In 2015, each Chinese coastal resident experienced on average RSLR of 11 to 20 mm/yr. This is 3 to 5 times higher than climate-induced SLR, reflecting that people are concentrated in subsiding locations. In 2050, assuming these subsidence rates continue, land area, population and assets exposed to the 100-year coastal flood event is 20%-39%, 17%-37% and 18%-39% higher than assuming climate change alone, respectively. Realistic subsidence control measures can avoid up to two thirds of this additional growth in exposure, with adaptation required to address the residual. This analysis emphasizes subsidence as a RSLR hazard in China that requires a broad-scale policy response, utilizing subsidence control combined with coastal adaptation. Chinese coastal populations are concentrated in subsiding locations, and also subject to sea-level rise. Here the authors find that more areas, population and assets are exposed to coastal flooding by 2050 but realistic subsidence control measures can avoid additional risks.

The present study uses Generalized Extreme Value distribution, Expert Team on Climate Change and Detection Indices, and Standardized Precipitation Index to examine the trend in extreme rainfall events over the IRBs using long-term observed high-resolution gridded rainfall data (1901-2019) obtained from India Meteorological Department. The analysis depicts a marked shifting trend in extreme rainfall events from northeastern Indian river basins toward the western Indian river basins during the recent decades of 1981-2019. The spatial variations in the annual maximum rainfall for the 10-, 30-, and 100-year return levels show statistically significant increasing trends over the IRBs. The observed decadal changes of rainfall during wet and dry conditions showed the shifting and increasing (15%-58.74%) pattern in extreme rainfall events during the last decades of the 20th and current twenty first century over the west-flowing river basins. This research highlights the significant increasing trend in extreme rainfall events, which may pose a grave risk to agriculture, human life, and infrastructure, predominantly on the vulnerable sections of the society.

This reflects high exposure to hydroclimatic hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Rapidly growing cities and low-lying coastal zones/estuaries also face threats from sea level rise and storm surges. However, climate model projections remain very uncertain about most of these risks, so water infrastructure and operations need to consider a range of plausible futures. Against this background, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been developing frameworks, tools, and capacities in climate risk and adaptation assessment and management. Project teams are often operating in data-scarce situations and under significant time constraints, so the emphasis has been on creating pragmatic guidance and training resources. This paper charts the transition of climate risk management (CRM) within the ADB from a predominantly scenario-led to decision-led approach to adaptation. Examples are given of light-touch procedures for screening climate risks, strengthening the transparency and rigour of scenario analysis, raising awareness of a broad range of adaptation options, streamlining identification of CRM options, and embedding allowances for climate change in detailed engineering designs. Such practical innovations would benefit communities of practice beyond the Asia-Pacific region.

Under the current climate change scenario, the adaptive capacity that communities possess and will possess is important. For this reason, it is significant to highlight the practices that have proven effective in confronting climate variations. Using ethnographic methods and a review of ethnohistoric and climatic sources, seasonal practices of crop and flood management are characterized in the Apanza and Livilcar ravine, approaching the pattern of climatic variability that stimulated the adaptation of their communities. The results show that the region's past and projected climate present a recurrence of periods with greater and lesser availability of water just like when these practices were employed. Consequently, the disuse of adaptive practices can be linked to the sporadic connection that people currently maintain with the territories which stimulated strategies for resource management, within the context of 'de-peasantization' and urbanization experienced by in the region.

Here, we compare bird assemblages of Amazonian river islands with a variety of mainland habitats. We also examine how bird species diversity and composition are related to island physical attributes. Birds were sampled with mist nets and qualitative censuses on 11 river islands and 24 mainland sites on the lower reaches of the Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon. Island bird assemblages were characterized by lower species richness and a higher abundance of a few dominant species. Additionally, the species composition of the islands was distinct from that of the mainland, including the nearby floodplain habitats. The number of bird species increased with island size and habitat diversity, and decreased with degree of isolation. In addition, small islands tended to harbor an impoverished subset of the species present on larger ones. Bird species diversity and composition on Amazonian river islands are likely influenced by the ecological succession and historical events affecting island formation. Considering their small total area across the Amazon basin, these insular fluvial communities could be disproportionately threatened by river channel disturbances related to climate change or hydroelectric dam development.

This paper investigates coverage of water issues across seven newspapers in the core of the U.S. Intermountain West region. Newspapers have the potential to set agendas and influence perceived salience of issues among consumers. The Intermountain West region shares common concerns about water supply and demand, climate change, and water quality. We investigate whether or not local daily newspaper coverage of water issues provides a more local or regional sensitivity. Findings from this exploratory study reveal differences in water coverage across local daily newspapers. The overall volume of water-related articles differed across newspapers as did proportion of articles on specific water topics and connecting issues. Coverage of local issues was more dominant than might be expected given mass media trends, but water geography in articles extended across the U.S. and the world in every newspaper studied. Variations in newspaper coverage of water issues suggests more local nuance persists despite the experience of common water issues across the region.

Thus, the objectives of this work were to propose a calibration approach based on time series analyses for a karst aquifer and to assess the impact of climate change on spring discharge. Based on more than 3 years of high-resolution continuous monitoring, a semi-distributed lumped model was calibrated and validated for the Qachqouch karst spring, north of Beirut (Lebanon). Time series analyses and decomposition of spring hydrographs revealed that the system has a high regulatory function, with considerable storage capacity providing stable flow (minimum flow of 0.2 m(3) s(-1)) during the dry season and with flow rates exceeding 10m(3) s(-1) during the wet season, which is similar to other karst aquifers in the region. Based on this detailed understanding of the hydrodynamics of the system, the model geometry and parameters were validated. Three linear reservoirs were implemented to reproduce the combined contribution of the different flow components of the system. A satisfactory simulation (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, NSE, of 0.72) of the measured spring flow rates was obtained after calibration. Climate change conditions (+1 to +3 degrees C warming, -10 % to -30 % less precipitation annually, and the intensification of rain events) were added to a baseline climatic year to produce scenarios of expected spring flow responses. Results show that the Qachqouch karst aquifer is sensitive to decreasing rainfall, which is associated with more pronounced recessions, with flow rates decreasing by 34 % and 1-month longer dry periods. Because of the limited influence of snow on the spring flow rate, a warming climate has less impact on spring flow conditions than a reduction in precipitation. Although the model shows that increasing rainfall intensity induces larger floods, recessions, and shorter low-flow periods, the real impact of high-intensity precipitation events remains uncertain, as the model does not account for complex unsaturated and epikarstic processes.

This study aims to analyze and to quantify the significance of change on annual, seasonal and daily rainfall in North and Central Benin, and to infer future challenges for crop production. Daily rainfall data for the 1970-2016 period measured at three weather stations (Save, Malanville and Tanguieta) were obtained from the Benin National Weather Agency. Descriptive statistics, standardized anomaly of rainfall (SAR) and rainfall intensity were used to analyze rainfall variability. For rainfall trends analysis, we tested for auto-correlation and used the Mann-Kendall and modified Mann-Kendall tests for non-auto-correlated and auto-correlated data, respectively. Trend magnitude was estimated using Sen's slope. Globally, a moderate-to-high seasonal rainfall and low variability of yearly rainfall were observed. The SAR indicated more than 50% of the years in the studies period experienced dry years. Between 1970 and 2016, a significant 20% increase was observed in the yearly rainfall in Tanguieta, whereas no significant trends were observed in Malanville (10% increase) and Save (0.6% decrease). The general rainfall increase observed during the post-monsoon season (October-November) in the three weather stations potentially increases flood frequencies during the harvest period of some crops, which can reduce crop yields. Adaptation strategies are needed which can mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture. These findings are essential to the climate risk management in agriculture and to target appropriate adaptive measures for resilience building in the sector.

The intergovernmental panel for climate change (IPCC) predicts that climate change will severely impact the coastal region, river systems, and ur-ban infrastructures. The changing climate is observed to be increasing the frequency and magni-tude of extreme hydrometeorological conditions, such as storm surges that adversely affect coastal areas by flood inundation. This study emphasizes the need to use extreme events and so-cio-economic data to evaluate the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for planning and adaptation measures. Therefore, the present study utilizes spatially varying surge heights for improved esti-mation of the CVI, unlike the constant surge heights considered in the previous studies. For coastal adaptation measures, synthetic cyclones of different return periods, such as 20-, 50-and 100-year, are simulated using a hydrodynamic model to represent a range of risk and vulnerabil-ity in the estimated CVI. The proposed methodology for calculating the CVI is demonstrated by considering the Chennai coast in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The use of spatial distribution of storm surges from hydrodynamic simulations makes the CVI more realistic. Such thorough assess-ments utilizing high-resolution CVI maps can help policymakers suggest appropriate measures for specific coastal zones, which are more devastatingly affected by shoreline erosion, SLR and storm surge. The vulnerability assessment indicates that great care is needed in the planning and adap-tation of the coastal ecosystem to extreme events for the safety and well-being of coastal popula-tions and infrastructures.

The "pyrodiversity begets biodiversity" hypothesis suggests that wildfires that generate temporally and spatially heterogeneous mosaics of wildfire severity and post-burn recovery enhance biodiversity at landscape scales. However, river management has often led to channel incision that disconnects rivers from their floodplains, desiccating floodplain habitats and depleting groundwater. In conjunction with predicted increases in frequency, intensity and extent of wildfires under climate change, this increases the likelihood of deep, uniform burns that reduce biodiversity. Predicted synergy of river restoration and biodiversity increase Recent focus on floodplain re-wetting and restoration of successional floodplain habitat mosaics, developed for river management and flood prevention, could reduce wildfire intensity in restored floodplains and make the burns less uniform, increasing climate-change resilience; an important synergy. According to theory, this would also enhance biodiversity. However, this possibility is yet to be tested empirically. We suggest potential research avenues. Illustration and future directions We illustrate the interaction between wildfire and river restoration using a restoration project in Oregon, USA. A project to reconnect the South Fork McKenzie River and its floodplain suffered a major burn ("Holiday Farm" wildfire, 2020), offering a rare opportunity to study the interaction between this type of river restoration and wildfire; specifically, the predicted increases in pyrodiversity and biodiversity. Given the importance of river and wetland ecosystems for biodiversity globally, a research priority should be to increase our understanding of potential mechanisms for a "triple win" of flood reduction, wildfire alleviation and biodiversity promotion.

We collected a unique 5-year time series of major ion, nutrient, and trace metal data from lakes in the Mackenzie Delta (NT, Canada) to examine limnological changes during a period of variable flood conditions, including years of recent historic high and low peak river levels. Previous work in the Mackenzie Delta has established that lake water chemistry is strongly related to connection time with the river during the period of spring ice-jam flooding or via channel connections through the growing season. We show that differences in peak spring water levels explain differences in lake chemistry in lakes isolated from the channel during the summer. Isolated, macrophyte-rich lakes in the Mackenzie Delta have been shown to be CO2 absorbers during summer. We demonstrate a response to alterations in flood regime by variables related to macrophyte productivity in isolated lakes with the greatest connectivity to the river that suggests productivity declines with increasing connection time. The connectivity of low-elevation lakes, which represent a majority of lake number and area in the Mackenzie Delta, has been projected to increase with climate change. Our work suggests that an increase in connection time may decrease the macrophyte productivity of these lakes, with potential consequences to the CO2 balance of individual lakes and the Mackenzie Delta as a whole.

In this study, we develop a reactive transport model (Amanzi) for radionuclides (uranium, tritium, and others) and evaluate how different scenarios under climate change will influence the contaminant plume conditions and groundwater well concentrations. We demonstrate our approach using a two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model for the Savannah River Site F-Area, including mineral reaction and sorption processes. Different recharge scenarios are considered by perturbing the infiltration rate from the base case as well as considering cap-failure and climate projection scenarios. We also evaluate the uranium and nitrate concentration ratios between scenarios and the base case to isolate the sorption effects with changing recharge rates. The modeling results indicate that the competing effects of dilution and remobilization significantly influence pH, thus changing the sorption of uranium. At the maximum concentration on the breakthrough curve, higher aqueous uranium concentration implies that sorption is reduced with lower pH due to remobilization. To better evaluate the climate change impacts in the future, we develop the workflow to include the downscaled CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) climate projection data in the reactive transport model and evaluate how residual contamination evolves through 2100 under four climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The integration of climate modeling data and hydrogeochemistry models enables us to quantify the climate change impacts, assess which impacts need to be planned for, and therefore assist climate resiliency efforts and help guide site management.

This is because it helps to identify vulnerable people in particular communities and provides a better under-standing of the causes of their vulnerability. The objective of this scoping literature review paper is to describe the components, elements, criteria selection methods, scale and settings, data, analytical approaches, the purpose of the maps, sensitivity analysis and accuracy assessment techniques used for mapping flood vulnerability in developing countries. A search over the last decade was conducted in Web of Science and Scopus using the keywords: "flood vulnerability" OR "spatial modelling" AND "developing country". The results reveal that flood vulnerability map-ping in developing countries was integrated and multi-disciplinary and the mapping was mainly done at a community level or local level. Indicator-based multi-criteria analysis approaches and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were commonly used in mapping flood vulnerability. The selection of criteria or indicators was mostly based on the existing literature and expert knowledge. Stakeholder participation and use of indigenous knowledge in producing the flood vulnerability maps was limited in the reviewed studies. Sensitivity analysis was hardly done and the lack of reliable, updated and high-resolution data adversely affected the validation and us-ability of the flood vulnerability maps. Since a lot of people especially in urban areas are expected to be vulnerable to flood hazards due to climate change, validated and accurate flood vulnera-bility maps are crucial in supporting decision making and strategic interventions aimed are reducing flood risks.

Access and use of climate information is considered vital to households' and communities' adaptive capacity. This research employed a survey to investigate barriers to the access, and use of, formal climate change information among two groups of farmers (ethnic minority and Kinh) in mountainous areas of Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. Adopting a logit model, the results show that the main barriers were: 1) farmers' lack of trust of formal climate-related services; 2) farmers' lack of perceived risk from climate change; and 3) difficulties in balancing climate adaptation and economic benefits of new interventions. Ethnicity was not a barrier, as all farmers looked for climate information from informal channels (friends, neighbors, market actors) rather than from formal channels (agricultural departments, television, radio), although cultural issues such as language did act as a barrier. This research recommends strengthening the networks and interactions between market actors and government staff with local people, through direct communication and adaptation demonstrations. Formal and informal climate information channels should be integrated to effectively combine local resources and indigenous knowledge with advanced technologies, to support farmers' sustainable and robust climate adaptation responses. Further, the research found that while farmers have access to devices, such as smart phones, they prefer to use these for entertainment rather than climate information. The implications of the study therefore are that any future network or communication activities should be in local languages and note the limitations of using devices for information dissemination.

Recently, a new fluvial sedimentary sequence with magnetostratigraphic ages spanning from similar to 53 to 40 Ma was found in the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, thereby providing a window to understand Eocene climate change in the Asian interior. From this fluvial sedimentary sequence, we present early-middle Eocene hydroclimate variations based on a combined method of rock magnetism and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Our results show magnetic enhancement of fluvial sediments at 51.7 Ma resulted from abundant single-domain magnetite inputs from the surrounding mountains through strong erosion and transport in a relatively wet environment. Subsequently, at 47.6 Ma, magnetic weakening of floodplain sediments corresponds to an increase in hematite concentrations produced via low-temperature oxidation in a prolonged dry environment. Comparisons of paleoclimatic proxies, such as organic geochemistry and rock magnetism from neighboring basins, tectonic deformation of the NE Tibetan Plateau, and sea level change in the Paratethys Sea suggest that the hydroclimate variation from relatively wet to dry climate in the early-middle Eocene in this area was mainly controlled by global climatic change and probably superimposed by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Tabari, H				Tabari, Hossein			Extreme value analysis dilemma for climate change impact assessment on global flood and extreme precipitation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological extremes; Block maxima; Peak-over-threshold; Climate change signals; Spatial distribution; Event extremity	CMIP5 MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLES; FUTURE CHANGES; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; ANNUAL MAXIMUM; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; FREQUENCY; TRENDS	A reliable estimation of hydrological extremes with potentially severe socio-economic impacts is of crucial importance for efficient planning and design of hydraulic structures. Extreme value theory provides a firm theoretical foundation for the statistical modelling of extreme hydrological events. The dilemma in the modelling is on whether to use block maxima (BM) or peak-over-threshold (POT) method, each with its own cons and pros. It remains unexplored to what extent future projected changes in extreme hydrological events are influenced by the method choice, especially when some simplifications are made to lessen the computational burden for largescale studies. This study addresses this research question by a comparative analysis between the BM and POT methods on future climate change impact on global flood and extreme precipitation. The extreme precipitation analysis is performed using 24 CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs), while the flood analysis is based on a multi-model ensemble of 20 members including five global impact models forced by four CMIP5 GCMs. The results reveal that the BM and POT methods agree on the sign of changes in flood and extreme precipitation intensities, but disagree on the magnitude. The discrepancy between the BM and POT results increases with event extremity. The difference also varies with season, where the difference in the global land area with increasing signals peaks in winter at the rates of 11% for extreme precipitation and in summer at the rates of 3.5% for flood.

The Parque Nacional Doflana (PND) is a site where studies are being carried out that deal with the possible impact and vulnerability of this phenomenon. This research aims to analyze the evolution and trend of the temperature and speed of the surface wind in the PND during the period 1994 - 2014. For this, data from the global scale meteorological model of the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used and the evolution of the monthly average (EPM), the evolution and interannual trend (ETI), and the evolution and seasonal trend were obtained (ETE). The EPM of both variables is typical of the Northern Hemisphere, that is, warm months with mild temperatures and less windy, and cold months with mild and windy temperatures. The ETI shows different fluctuations, in general a warming trend (0.23 degrees C) and a slight increase in the wind (0.1 m.s(-1)) were observed in the last two decades. TEE for the winter indicates a tendency to be colder and less windy; while for the other seasons a tendency to be warmer and windier. A temperature increases in spring (0.8 degrees C) and summer / autumn (1.5 degrees C) is estimated in the next 35 years. The contribution generated in this study represents a guiding element for various disciplines related to flora, fauna, marsh flooding, among others.

Most of the work quantifying these changes has been done in small areas and over relatively recent time scales. These land-cover transitions are highly spatially variable, and we have limited understanding of the factors underlying this variation. We use repeat photography to generate a data set of land-cover changes in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, stretching back a century and spanning a range of edaphic, topographic, and climatic conditions. Most land-cover classes were quite stable, with low probabilities of transitioning to other land-cover types. The advance of woody vegetation into low-stature tundra, and the spread of conifer trees into shrub-dominated areas, were both more likely at low elevations and in areas without permafrost. Permafrost also reduced the likelihood of herbaceous vegetation transitioning to woody cover. Exceptions to the general trend of relative stability included nearly all (96%) of the broadleaf forest-dominated areas being invaded by conifers, an expected successional trajectory, and many open gravel river bars (17.8%) transitioning to thick shrubs. These floodplain areas were distinctly not at equilibrium, as only 0.1% of shrub-dominated areas converted to gravel. Warming temperatures in coming decades and concomitant declines in the extent of permafrost are predicted to enhance the spread of woody vegetation in Denali further, but only by similar to 3%. Land-cover transitions, notably the rapid advance of trees and shrubs observed in other studies, could be less likely and more spatially heterogeneous here than in other high-latitude systems.

Recent developments in ice thickness modelling combined with high-resolution glacier surface data led to the generation of modelling approaches to simulate the ice-free bedrock topography below current glaciers and to detect potential glacier bed overdeepenings (GBO) that may form into future lakes. We simulated the subglacial topography in the Austrian Alps using two different ice thickness models. Glaciers in the study area differ significantly from glaciers investigated in previous studies on potential future lakes because of their in general small size and location often restricted to cirques. The aim of this study is to estimate the number and location of potential future lakes in Austria. We tested the performance of ice thickness models for modelling of potential future lakes in an environment dominated by mountain glaciers that are under high stress of climate change. Modelling results are compared with lakes that evolved since the modelling periods and with data on subglacial topography derived from geophysical surveys. Results show significant differences in model performance concerning the total ice volume and the number of simulated GBOs. The number and total area of the modelled GBOs is overestimated, compared with the number of lakes that have evolved in the past. Most GBOs are simulated for valley type glaciers, even though most glaciers are mountain types. This does not match with the location of existing glacial lakes that are dominantly found in cirques. We ascertain that this modelling approach performs better on large valley type glaciers and less well on mountain glaciers. Intersecting the modelling runs indicates that up to 42 new lakes may form within 23 glaciers in Austria covering a total area of 2 km(2).

To assess alterations in streamflow regimes, typically temporal variations in one or a few streamflow characteristics are taken into account. This approach, however, cannot see simultaneous changes in multiple streamflow characteristics, does not utilize all the available information contained in a streamflow hydrograph, and cannot describe how and to what extent streamflow regimes evolve from one to another. To address these gaps, we conceptualize streamflow regimes as intersecting spectrums that are formed by multiple streamflow characteristics. Accordingly, the changes in a streamflow regime should be diagnosed through gradual, yet continuous changes in an ensemble of streamflow characteristics. To incorporate these key considerations, we propose a generic algorithm to first classify streams into a finite set of intersecting fuzzy clusters. Accordingly, by analyzing how the degrees of membership to each cluster change in a given stream, we quantify shifts from one regime to another. We apply this approach to the data, obtained from 105 natural Canadian streams, during the period of 1966 to 2010. We show that natural streamflow in Canada can be categorized into six regime types, with clear hydrological and geographical distinctions. Analyses of trends in membership values show that alterations in natural streamflow regimes vary among different regions. Having said that, we show that in more than 80 % of considered streams, there is a dominant regime shift that can be attributed to simultaneous changes in streamflow characteristics, some of which have remained previously unknown. Our study not only introduces a new globally relevant algorithm for identifying changing streamflow regimes but also provides a fresh look at streamflow alterations in Canada, highlighting complex and multifaceted impacts of climate change on streamflow regimes in cold regions.

Therefore, expectations have been high on the recent generation of high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate models (CPRCMs), to reproduce the small-scale features of observed (extreme) rainfall that are driving small-scale hydrological hazards. Are they living up to these expectations? In this study, we zoom in on southern Sweden and investigate to which extent two climate models, a 3-km resolution CPRCM (HCLIM3) and a 12-km non-convection permitting RCM (HCLIM12), are able to reproduce the rainfall climate with focus on short-duration extremes. We use three types of evaluation-intensity-based, time-based and event-based-which have been designed to provide an added value to users of high-intensity rainfall information, as compared with the ways climate models are generally evaluated. In particular, in the event-based evaluation we explore the prospect of bringing climate model evaluation closer to the user by investigating whether the models are able to reproduce a well-known historical high-intensity rainfall event in the city of Malmo 2014. The results very clearly point at a substantially reduced bias in HCLIM3 as compared with HCLIM12, especially for short-duration extremes, as well as an overall better reproduction of the diurnal cycles. Furthermore, the HCLIM3 model proved able to generate events similar to the one in Malmo 2014. The results imply that CPRCMs offer a clear potential for increased confidence in future projections of small-scale hydrological climate change impacts, which is crucial for climate-proofing, e.g., our cities, as well as climate modeling in general.

This tool has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sector of one municipality (Me?rtola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20 interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present avenues for future research.

Phenological models can aid in understanding and predicting growing season changes and can be parameterized with gross primary production (GPP) estimated using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. This study used nine years of EC-derived GPP data from three mature subtropical longleaf pine forests in the southeastern United States with differing soil water holding capacity in combination with site-specific micrometeorological data to parameterize a photosynthesis-based phenological model. We evaluated how weather conditions and prescribed fire led to variation in the ecosystem phenological processes. The results suggest that soil water availability had an effect on phenology, and greater soil water availability was associated with a longer growing season (LOS). We also observed that prescribed fire, a common forest management activity in the region, had a limited impact on phenological processes. Dormant season fire had no significant effect on phenological processes by site, but we observed differences in the start of the growing season (SOS) between fire and non-fire years. Fire delayed SOS by 10 d +/- 5 d (SE), and this effect was greater with higher soil water availability, extending SOS by 18 d on average. Fire was also associated with increased sensitivity of spring phenology to radiation and air temperature. We found that interannual climate change and periodic weather anomalies (flood, short-term drought, and long-term drought), controlled annual ecosystem phenological processes more than prescribed fire. When water availability increased following short-term summer drought, the growing season was extended. With future climate change, subtropical areas of the Southeastern US are expected to experience more frequent short-term droughts, which could shorten the region's growing season and lead to a reduction in the longleaf pine ecosystem's carbon sequestration capacity.

Flood frequency obtained based on historical flow records may also be changing under future climate conditions. The associated flood inundation and environmental transport processes will also be affected. In this study, an integrated numerical modeling framework is proposed to investigate the inundation and sedimentation during multiple flood events (2,5,10, 20, 50, 100, 200-year) under future climate change scenarios in a watershed system in northern California. USA. The proposed modeling framework couples physical models of various spatial resolution: kilometers to several hundred kilometers dimatic processes, hillslope scale hydrological processes in a watershed, and centimeters to meters scale hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes in a riverine system. The modeling results show that compared to the flows during historical periods, extreme events become more extreme in the 21st century and higher flows tend to be larger and smaller flows tend to be smaller in the system. Flood inundation in the study area, especially during 200-year events, is projected to increase in the future. More sediment will be trapped as the flow increases and the deposition will also increase in the settling basin. Sediment trap efficiency values are within 37.5-65.4% for the historical conditions, within 32.4-68.8% in the first half of the 21st century, and within 34.9-69.3% in the second half of the 21st century. The results highlight the impact of climate change on extreme flood events, the resulting sedimentation, and reflected the importance of incorporating the coupling of physical models into the adaptive watershed and river system management.

Many perennial rivers originate from Nepal Himalaya, located in the central part of the Himalayan region. Snowmelt water is essential freshwater for living, whereas it poses flood disaster potential, which is a major challenge for sustainable development. Climate change also largely affects snowmelt hydrology. Therefore, river discharge measurement requires crucial attention in the face of climate change, particularly in the Himalayan region. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is a frequently used method to measure river discharge in snow-fed mountain river basins. This study attempts to investigate snowmelt contribution in the overall discharge of the Budhi Gandaki River Basin (BGRB) using satellite remote sensing data products through the application of the SRM model. The model outputs were validated based on station measured river discharge data. The results show that SRM performed well in the study basin with a coefficient of determination (R-2) >0.880. Moreover, this study found that the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological datasets are highly applicable to the SRM in the Himalayan region. The study also shows that snow days have slightly decreased in the last three years, hence snowmelt contribution in overall discharge has decreased slightly in the study area. Finally, this study concludes that MOD10A2 and ECMWF precipitation and two-meter temperature products are highly applicable to measure snowmelt and associated discharge through SRM in the BGRB. Moreover, it also helps with proper freshwater planning, efficient use of winter water flow, and mitigating and preventive measures for the flood disaster.

Many existing indices for analysing extreme climate conditions focus on the statistical behaviour of a single hydrological variable, such as precipitation or temperature. Such indices have limitations in providing a comprehensive interpretations of elaborate extreme climate conditions. In this study, the hydrological severity index (HSI), which is defined as the ratio of precipitation to the sum of evapotranspiration, runoff, and terrestrial water storage from the water balance equation, was proposed and calculated using Global Land Data Assimilation System datasets for 1980-2010. Mean HSI was relatively high in tropical regions due to the high sensitivity of precipitation, while it was relatively low in semi-arid and arid regions due to low precipitation and high evaporative demand. HSI showed a good representation of hydrological severity based on the spatial pattern of the absolute correlation coefficient as well as the opposite pattern of the coefficient of variation calculated from HSI and the radiative index of dryness. Based on the aforementioned phenomenon, temporal anomaly HSI (HSIanom) was applied to Pakistan and Australia as case studies to analyse the 2010 Pakistan Flooding and the Australian Millennium Drought (especially in 2002 and 2006). The HSIanom was able to capture the severity of extreme climate events and to provide underlying causes accompanying the physical climate forcing system. Specifically, the spatial pattern of HSIanom was useful for analysing regions with high severity to extreme climate conditions. The HSI can be used to establish water management policies that consider regional hydrological features in order to cope with intensified climate change. In addition, stand-alone HSI could be used to predict future climate trends based on precise simulations of hydrological variables.

Financing for WaterWater for Financing: A Global Review of Policy and Practice	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						water; floods; water supply; climate adaptation; financing; SDGs; policy	21ST-CENTURY	The relationship between the water and financial sectors is explored through a review of past and current policies and practices, and new needs driven by growing water insecurity (i.e., drought and floods) and climate change. This paper focuses on emerging markets and developing economies. The conventional agenda of providing safe drinking water supply and sanitation has met with growing success. The newer water resources agenda covering flood, drought and irrigation, in contrast, has to address rapid alterations in the landscape due to destruction of catchments, and rapid water use growth. By approximately 2045 the world will transition from a predominantly water-abundant place to a predominantly water-scarce one. Though this masks large regional differences, pressure will grow to improve water management and broaden adoption of technologies and policies for recycling, desalination and water efficiency. Climate change will exacerbate these trends. Finance for the water agenda has been dominated by public budgets. To meet the SDGs, the need for finance in emerging markets and developing economies is 2-4 times larger than current practice. National budgets have grown significantly while international development assistance has grown modestly. Commercial finance holds promise but is constrained by high-risk profiles of many water investments: deals are small or risky and creditworthiness of water utilities and municipalities is weak. Access to commercial finance can be enhanced through blended finance, intermediary institutions and, increasingly, local capital markets. However, though the capacity to access finance is constrained in many developing economies, the capacity to absorb finance and prepare bankable proposals proves even more constraining. Climate change is emerging as a systemic threat to corporate and financial assets. Water insecurity undercuts the financial viability of production assets, services and real estate. It is argued that the longer-term interests of the water and financial sectors will converge.

A Novel Physics-Aware Machine Learning-Based Dynamic Error Correction Model for Improving Streamflow Forecast Accuracy	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						hybrid model; HBV model; random forest; particle filter; streamflow forecast; uncertainty quantification	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; KOSHI RIVER-BASIN; DATA ASSIMILATION; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SWAT MODEL; UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION; PARTICLE FILTERS; ENSEMBLE	Occurrences of extreme events, especially floods, have become more frequent and severe in the recent past due to the global impacts of climate change. In this context, possibilities for generating a near-accurate streamflow forecast at higher lead times, which could be utilized for developing a reliable flood warning system to minimize the effects of extreme events, are highly important. This paper aims to investigate the potential of a novel hybrid modeling framework that couples the random forest algorithm, particle filter, and the HBV model for improving the overall accuracy of forecasts at higher lead times through the dynamic error correction schematic. The new framework simulates an ensemble of streamflow for estimating uncertainty associated with the predictions and is applied across two snow-fed Himalayan rivers: the Beas River in India and the Sunkoshi River in Nepal. Several statistical indices along with graphical performance indicators were used for assessing the accuracy of the model performance and associated uncertainty. The modeling framework achieved the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.94 and 0.98 in calibration and 0.95 and 0.99 in validation for the Beas and Sunkoshi river basin respectively for a 7-day ahead forecast. Thus, the proposed framework can be considered as a promising tool having reasonably good performance in forecasting streamflow at a higher lead time.	[Roy, Abhinanda; Kasiviswanathan, K.

Joint behaviour of climate extremes across India: Past and future	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Copula; India; Joint return period; Precipitation extremes; Temperature extremes	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS; TEMPERATURE INDEXES; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; COPULA; EVENTS; PROBABILITY; DROUGHTS; RAINFALL	Climate change significantly influences the global hydrological cycle and consequently affects climatic extremes. Therefore, the present study focuses upon the varying patterns of climate extremes across India for past and future. Here, a comprehensive methodological framework incorporating univariate and joint probabilistic analysis (using copulas) has been proposed to study the climate extremes. Moreover, multi-model ensembles of climate extreme indices are developed using reliability ensemble averaging (REA) technique for reducing uncertainty in projecting future climate extremes. The datasets used are daily precipitation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature for past (1975-2019), and future (2025-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario. A preliminary assessment of climate extremes indicates that R20, R95p, consecutive wet days (CWD), TXx, TNx, TX90p, TN90p, TNn and TXn show a positive trend predominantly across India in future. The bivariate assessment of precipitation extreme indices for the period (1989-2019) suggests that parts of north-western, north-eastern, southern, western region and Western Ghats are highly prone to floods and a large portion of country is vulnerable towards co-occurrence of floods and droughts. Moreover, integrated assessment of extreme number of hot days (TX90p) and nights (TN90p) indicate that along with the projected increase in hot days/nights, the frequency of their concurrence in a year is likely to increase in future over the country. The present study provides useful information on the regional distribution of climate extremes and can further contribute to facilitate an effective adaptation strategy.

A recent satellite analysis of the Amazon basin suggests this might happen first in floodplains where forests are particularly fragile. We studied floodplain landscapes of the middle Rio Negro, covering similar to 4100 km(2) at the Central Amazon region, where forest ecosystems are dominant. We used Landsat images to map 40 years of wildfire history and test the hypothesis that repeatedly burnt forests fail to regenerate and can be replaced by white-sand savanna ecosystems. In the field, using a chronosequence of 'time after the first fire', we assessed changes in tree species composition, herbaceous cover and topsoil properties. Here we show that when these forests are repeatedly disturbed by wildfires, their soil gradually loses clay and nutrients and becomes increasingly sandy. In synchrony, native herbaceous cover expands, forest tree species disappear and white-sand savanna tree species become dominant. This drastic ecosystem shift happened within 40 years, likely accelerated by topsoil erosion. When recurrent fires maintain floodplain forests in an open vegetation state, topsoil erosion intensifies, transforming clay-rich soils into white-sand soils that may favour savanna tree species. Our findings reveal that white-sand savannas may expand through seasonally flooded ecosystems at the core of the Amazon, facilitated by wildfires.

However, more fundamental knowledge is required to understand how nutrient turnover in wetlands is affected. In this study, we deployed a mechanistic biogeochemical model of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) cycles at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution across wetlands in Australia. Our modeling was used to assess nutrient inputs to soil, elemental nutrient fluxes across the soil organic and mineral pools, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different climatic areas. In the decade 2008-2017, we estimated an average annual emission of 5.12 Tg-CH4, 90.89 Tg-CO2, and 2.34 x 10(-2) Tg-N2O. Temperate wetlands in Australia have three times more N2O emissions than tropical wetlands as a result of fertilization, despite similar total area extension. Tasmania wetlands have the highest areal GHG emission rates. C fluxes in soil depend strongly on hydroclimatic factors; they are mainly controlled by anaerobic respiration in temperate and tropical regions and by aerobic respiration in arid regions. In contrast, N and S fluxes are mostly governed by plant uptake regardless of the region and season. The new knowledge from this study may help design conservation and adaptation plans to climate change and better protect the Australian wetland ecosystem.	[Pasut, Chiara; Tang, Fiona H.

In order to fully understand this relationship, it is necessary to constrain the quantity and type of degassed magmatic volatiles, and to determine the depth of their source and the timing of eruption. Here we present direct evidence of abundant CO2 in basaltic rocks from the end-Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), through investigation of gas exsolution bubbles preserved by melt inclusions. Our results indicate abundance of CO2 and a mantle and/or lower-middle crustal origin for at least part of the degassed carbon. The presence of deep carbon is a key control on the emplacement mode of CAMP magmas, favouring rapid eruption pulses (a few centuries each). Our estimates suggest that the amount of CO2 that each CAMP magmatic pulse injected into the end-Triassic atmosphere is comparable to the amount of anthropogenic emissions projected for the 21(st) century. Such large volumes of volcanic CO2 likely contributed to end-Triassic global warming and ocean acidification. Many major mass extinction events have been associated with large volcanic eruption events, with the argument that large volumes of volcanic degassing could trigger past global climate changes.

Coastal vulnerability assessment using GIS-Based multicriteria analysis of Alexandria-northwestern Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						atellite images; Classification; ASTER; DEM; GIS; Multi-criteria; Coastal vulnerability; Alexandria-northwestern Nile delta; Egypt	SEA-LEVEL RISE; MEDITERRANEAN COAST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROMONTORIES; ADAPTATION; SUBSIDENCE; REGION; BEACH	This study intends to map the relative coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the administrative governorates of Alexandria and adjacent Behera in the northwestern coastal margin of the Nile delta. In addition to other common environmental stresses, these governorates are under threat due to accelerated sea level rise induced from climate change. Of special interest is that the coastal margin of the study area is characterized by markedly constructing geology, morpho-dynamics and land surface topography that varies from low-lying (-3 m below MSL) to high land (similar to 20 m height). Therefore, nine physical and geological variables influencing the vulnerability of the coast are used in this study, including land elevation, seabed/beach composition, beach type (dissipative to reflective), relative sea level, historical shoreline change, tidal range, significant wave height, shore protection measures, and land cover. Results obtained from performing multi-criteria analysis of GIS indicates that about 16.58%, 15.45, 42.03%, 18.16 and 7.78% of the shoreline is under very high, high, moderate, low and very low vulnerability respectively. Of great concern is that although the low-lying broad depression (-1 to -3 m below MSL) east and southeast of Alexandria is protected now by a combination of natural shoreparallel elevated ridges (up to 10 m) and artificial shore-parallel detached structures, it is likely to be accidently flooded by unexpected extreme storm or tsunami events at the lowest waterfront points.

In light of this, we synthesized literature data and used the APSIM software to enhance the modeling capacity to simulate plant growth, development, and N fixation response to flooding. Literature data included greenhouse and field experiments from across the U.S. that investigated the impact of flood timing and duration on soybean. Five datasets were used for model parameterization of new functions and three datasets were used for testing. Improvements in prediction accuracy were quantified by comparing model performance before and after the implementation of new stage-dependent excess water functions for phenology, photosynthesis and N-fixation. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) for yield predictions improved by 26% and the RRMSE predictions of biomass improved by 40%. Extensive model testing found that the improved model accurately simulates plant responses to flooding including how these responses change with flood timing and duration. When used to project soybean response to future climate scenarios, the model showed that intense rain events had a greater negative effect on yield than a 25% increase in rainfall distributed over 1 or 3 month(s). These developments advance our ability to understand, predict and, thereby, mitigate yield loss as increases in climatic volatility lead to more frequent and intense flooding events in the future.

In this study, uptake and accumulation of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and their bioavailability in the rhizosphere across the Salix clones under flooded versus non-flooded (control) conditions were investigated using a pot experiment. The tested Salix clones grew well without showing any toxic symptoms under non-flooded soil condition; in contrast, the clones showed 100% survival for long-term flooding with the development of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. There were wide clonal variations in biomass production and accumulation of Cu and Zn under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Flooded treatments dramatically decreased aboveground biomass across the Salix clones to different extents compared to the control. The non-flooded clones exhibited relatively high accumulation capacities of Cu and Zn in aerial parts. However, the flooded clones resulted in more substantial reductions in Cu and Zn accumulation in aerial parts, and most of Cu and Zn were limited in roots. EDTA-extractable Cu and Zn predicted well bioavailability of Cu and Zn to the Salix clones under the current condition. It was concluded that the Salix clones exhibited Cu and Zn phytoextraction traits (non-flooding) or phytostabilization traits (flooding), which provides a valuable insight into phytomanagement of contaminated soils by willows subjected to flooding stress.

Flood insurance arrangements in the European Union for future flood risk under climate and socioeconomic change	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Flood risk; Insurance; Public-private partnerships; Risk reduction	DISASTER-RISK; MITIGATION MEASURES; REDUCING LOSSES; REDUCTION; DISTRIBUTE; MANAGEMENT; PREMIUMS; GERMANY; JUSTICE; POLICY	Flood risk will increase in many areas around the world due to climate change and increase in economic exposure. This implies that adequate flood insurance schemes are needed to adapt to increasing flood risk and to minimise welfare losses for households in flood-prone areas. Flood insurance markets may need reform to offer sufficient and affordable financial protection and incentives for risk reduction. Here, we present the results of a study that aims to evaluate the ability of flood insurance arrangements in Europe to cope with trends in flood risk, using criteria that encompass common elements of the policy debate on flood insurance reform. We show that the average risk-based flood insurance premium could double between 2015 and 2055 in the absence of more risk reduction by households exposed to flooding. We show that part of the expected future increase in flood risk could be limited by flood insurance mechanisms that better incentivise risk reduction by policyholders, which lowers vulnerability. The affordability of flood insurance can be improved by introducing the key features of public-private partnerships (PPPs), which include public reinsurance, limited premium cross-subsidisation between low- and high-risk households, and incentives for policyholder-level risk reduction. These findings were evaluated in a comprehensive sensitivity analysis and support ongoing reforms in Europe and abroad that move towards risk-based premiums and link insurance with risk reduction, strengthen purchase requirements, and engage in multi-stakeholder partnerships.

In this study, the effects of soil loss and flooding caused by the fire disaster that occurred in the Icmeler town of Marmaris, one of the world's most popular touristic cities, were investigated. The study was carried out under three main methods. First, the affected terrain was determined by remote sensing methods. Then, soil loss was investigated by RUSLE method using satellite images after the fire disaster. Finally, using the SCS-CN precipitation-flow model method, the impact of the land change brought on by the fires on the flood magnitudes was investigated. As a result of the study, it was determined that the land change caused by the fires caused problems such as the increase in soil losses in the region as well as the increase in the size of the floods. After forest fires, the land should be afforested, terraced and the rainfall should be well drained.

The increasing concentration of population in coastal areas has a negative impact on the coastal ecosystem due to change in land use and the exploitation of natural resources, which has also increased exposure to coastal hazards. Risk assessment is hence a primary topic in coastal areas and are often affected by mismanagement and competition of interest between stakeholders. This paper presents an integrated model for coastal risk assessment as well as its application on a test site in the Puglia Region (Southern Italy). An innovative approach has been developed combining a traditional index-based model, exploiting a Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response framework (DPSIR), with stakeholder's and policy makers' engagement by using the Future Workshop method and complementary individual working sessions structured through the use of Fuzzy-Cognitive Maps. The study shows that stakeholders' and policy makers' risk perception play a key role in coastal risk management and that the integration of physical risk with social perception is relevant to develop more effective management following the basics of Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

This study estimates the impact of weather shocks on farmers' income, followed by the evaluation of their perceptions and coping strategies against weather shocks, in the rural area of district Multan in Pakistani Punjab. Primary data was collected through structured questionnaire survey of 273 randomly selected farmers and were analyzed through descriptive statistics and regression techniques. Results revealed that farmers used different coping strategies against weather shocks. Furthermore, the household size, flood, frost, drought and heavy rains frequency negatively impact farm income, while the explanatory variables such as non-farm income, machinery possession, weather information, farm size, education, hailstorm frequency and age positively impact farm income. It is recommended that micro level adaptation can boost the coping capacities of farmers. Diversification of income and early warning system can reduce the risk of losing sustenance. Cash support is instrumental to recover the livelihood and enable them to use appropriate strategies to cope with weather shocks.

WATER			English	Article						pluvial flooding; stormwater infrastructures; green infrastructures and grey infrastructures; awareness	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK PERCEPTION; CITIZENS; COMMUNICATION; ADOPTION	As a consequence of climate change, the impact of pluvial flooding is expected to increase in the next decades. Despite citizens' poor knowledge, several types of stormwater infrastructure can be implemented to mitigate the impact of future events. This paper focuses on the implementation of green and grey stormwater interventions (i.e., with or without vegetation) on private properties. Framed by the Protection Motivation Theory, a survey-based case study analysis, carried out in a pluvial flooding-prone area of the Veneto Region (Italy), highlights the main factors driving people's willingness to implement these interventions. The analysis shows that the implementation of grey stormwater infrastructures is driven by the perceived threat and the amount of past pluvial flooding damage (i.e., the direct experience as a proxy of prior knowledge) while the implementation of green stormwater infrastructures is driven also by additional factors (awareness of these interventions, age and education level of the citizens). Based on these results, lack of knowledge on innovative stormwater interventions represents a critical barrier to their implementation on private properties, and it confirms the need for specific dissemination and information activities.

Undoubtedly, the process of flood management in India is very complex due to the influence of several socio-hydroclimatological factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, and socioeconomic dynamics. While these factors influence the intensity and frequency of flood events, factors explicitly related to the process of flood management, such as the improper execution of traditional structural measures, the lack of the proper implementation of schemes, lackadaisical execution of traditional structural measures and end-to-end management of the flood management programs/practices, ensure only partial protection. This review article identifies the region-specific flood problems in India and discusses the initiatives undertaken by major Indian flood management agencies, with an emphasis on the current ongoing flood management practices. The effectiveness of these practices in the long term is discussed, and specific gaps are identified. The recommendations provided in this article may be useful to guide stakeholders and policymakers in formulating and implementing sustainable flood management plans for improved flood resilience.

Barrett			The Relationship between Climate Vulnerability and Disaster Declarations: A Case Study of Flood-Prone Indigenous Communities in Alaska	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article						Climate change vulnerability; Environmental justice; Flood risk; Indigenous communities; Disaster declarations	INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; ADAPTATION; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; NATIVES; EVENTS; MODEL	Using descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, one-way ANOVA, and an environmental justice lens, we considered the social and physical vulnerability factors associated with climate change and flood-related disaster declarations for Alaska Native Villages (ANVs), which are indigenous communities. We found that, on average, compared with communities not involved in disaster declarations, communities with disaster declarations between 1977 and 2014 had lower elevation, more exposure to erosion, less precipitation in summer and fall, larger populations, less population growth, a higher percentage of youth, larger household size, a higher percentage of Alaska Natives, more population below the poverty level, and lower per capita income. This finding is positive, because it suggests that, collectively, communities with greater vulnerability are getting more disaster declarations, which come with disaster aid. However, some of the most vulnerable communities may not be getting all the help they need. In particular, southwestern communities along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers were statistically more likely to get disaster declarations than were ANVs that received attention in the media and the literature for their vulnerability.

J	Floren, A; Horchler, PJ; Mueller, T				Floren, Andreas; Horchler, Peter J.; Mueller, Tobias			The Impact of the Neophyte Tree <i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i> [Marshall] on Beetle Diversity under Climate Change	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						forest conversion; neophyte trees; ash dieback; beetle communities; ecosystem function	SPECIES-DIVERSITY; EXOTIC TREES; DOUGLAS-FIR; INSECTS; COLEOPTERA; FORESTS	We studied the impact of the neophyte tree Fraxinus pennsylvanica on the diversity of beetles in floodplain forests along the river Elbe in Germany in 2016, 2017 and in 2020, where 80% of all Fraxinus excelsior trees had died following severe droughts. Beetles were collected by insecticidal knock-down from 121 trees (64 F. excelsior and 57 F. pennsylvanica) and identified to 547 species in 15,214 specimens. The trees sampled in 2016 and 2017 showed no signs of drought stress or ash dieback and serve as a reference for the comparison with the 2020 fauna. The data proved that F. excelsior harbours the most diverse beetle community, which differed also significantly in guild composition from F. pennsylvanica. Triggered by extremely dry and long summer seasons, the 2020 ash dieback had profound and forest-wide impacts. Several endangered, red-listed beetle species of Saxonia Anhalt had increased in numbers and became secondary pests on F. excelsior. Diversity decreased whilst numbers of xylobionts increased on all trees, reaching 78% on F. excelsior. Proportions of xylobionts remained constant on F. pennsylvanica. Phytophages were almost absent from all trees, but mycetophages increased on F. pennsylvanica. Our data suggest that as a result of the dieback of F. excelsior the neophyte F. pennsylvanica might become a rescue species for the European Ash fauna, as it provides the second-best habitat. We show how difficult it is to assess the dynamics and the ecological impact of neophytes, especially under conditions similar to those projected by climate change models. The diversity and abundance of canopy arthropods demonstrates their importance in understanding forest functions and maintenance of ecosystem services, illustrating that their consideration is essential for forest adaptation to climate change.

Increased Flood Exposure Due to Climate Change and Population Growth in the United States	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate change; extreme events; flood risk; large ensemble; hydrodynamic modeling	PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; EXTREME; FREQUENCY; TEMPERATURE; CHARACTER; MODEL; LAND	Precipitation extremes are increasing globally due to anthropogenic climate change. However, there remains uncertainty regarding impacts upon flood occurrence and subsequent population exposure. Here, we quantify changes in population exposure to flood hazard across the contiguous United States. We combine simulations from a climate model large ensemble and a high-resolution hydrodynamic flood model-allowing us to directly assess changes across a wide range of extreme precipitation magnitudes and accumulation timescales. We report a mean increase in the 100-year precipitation event of similar to 20% (magnitude) and >200% (frequency) in a high warming scenario, yielding a similar to 30-127% increase in population exposure. We further find a nonlinear increase for the most intense precipitation events-suggesting accelerating societal impacts from historically rare or unprecedented precipitation events in the 21st century. Plain Language Summary Heavy rainfall is increasing globally due to human-caused global warming. However, it is still unclear how these increases in heavy rainfall might affect flood risk. In this paper, we investigate how global warming and population changes together may be affecting the number of people at risk from floods in the United States. We combine simulations from a climate model and flood model-allowing us to consider a wide range of heavy rainfall events. We report a similar to 20% increase in the size and a >200% increase in the frequency of very heavy and rare rainfall events, which leads to a similar to 30-127% increase in the number of people at risk from floods. Finally, we find that the heaviest rainfall events increase by the widest margin-suggesting the possibility of major increases in damage and disruption caused by severe floods in the 21st century.

Rainfall events are projected to become more intense and frequent in a warm and wet future, and they pose a major challenge to the sustainable development of Kathmandu city. This paper analyses historical extreme rainfall patterns across the city and uses these as the basis for future projections in combination with a range of General Circulation Models. Future projections of extreme rainfall are then fed into the numerical flood model HAIL-CAESAR (Lisflood), using a high-resolution digital elevation model of Kathmandu. We show that rainfall intensity, such as the annual maximum 1-day rainfall (RX1day), is projected to increase by up to 72% in the future, and the historical 100-year return period rainfall will become a 20 or 25-year return period rainfall. The flood modelling results show that the future flood hazard (magnitude and extent) will increase. The historical 100-year return period flood discharge will correspond to a 25-year return period future flood. A 100-year period flood discharge is likely to increase up to 72% (37% median) in the future. Area of land inundated by more than 1 m in a 100-year return period flood event could increase from 11.7 km2 to 23 km2 in the future. Furthermore, the location and timing of rainfall maxima affect the peak, timing, and location of flood hazards. This analysis can serve as a scientific basis to assess future flood-induced risk in Kathmandu in response to climate change.

Headed by the Outer Hebrides Community Planning Partnership (OHCCP) Climate Change Working Group (CCWG), a range of adaptation planning documents are in production. Driven by a desire to engage with local communities, the CCWG alongside the L`an Thde Climate Beacon, Adaptation Scotland and the Met Office created a project to explore the development of a storyline to communicate climate change information to the Outer Hebrides community. Collaborating with a local artist, Tuil is Geil (Gaelic for "Flood and Wind") was created through a combination of sonified climate data, local voices and field recordings of local weather. Three themed pieces were created and these pieces (alongside a science presentation on projections of climate change for the Outer Hebrides) formed the centre of public engagement sessions when members of the public were able to share their thoughts about vulnerabilities and adaptation needs on the islands. As a project team we learned a number of important lessons around the process for creating a bespoke storyline for a community which included: i) The need to set appropriate boundaries and manage expectations, ii) The importance of local partner organisations and networks, iii) The need to bridge between science and art, and iv) The need to collaborate with the local community. We strongly believe that this approach has major community impact and it is the intention to support similar storyline projects in other regions of Scotland.

Assessing observed and projected flood vulnerability under climate change using multi-modeling statistical approaches in the Oueme River Basin, Benin (West Africa)	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Pluvial floods; Vulnerability assessment; Multiple methodological approaches; Oueme Basin; Benin	CHANGE IMPACTS; LAND-USE; UNCERTAINTY; HYDROLOGY	Climate change has severe impacts on the livelihoods of West-African communities with the floods of the late 2000s and early 2010s serving as factual evidence. Focusing on the assessment of observed and future vulnerability to extreme rainfall in the tropical Oueme River Basin, this study aims to provide scientific evidence to inform national adaptation plans. Observed climate variables, historical and future outputs from regional climate models, topographic, land cover, and socioeconomic data were used in the vulnerability assessment. This assessment was based on four indicator normalization methods (min-max, z-scores, distance to target, and ranking), two aggregation techniques (linear and geometric), four classification methods (quantile, standard deviation, equal intervals, natural breaks), and three robustness evaluation approaches (spearman correlation, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and average shift in ranks). Based on the AIC, it was found that "equal intervals" is the overall best classification method and the min-max normalization with linear aggregation (MM.LA) outperformed other methods. The median scenario indicates that the population of the Oueme Basin is vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change for the historical (1970-2015) and future periods (2020-2050) as a result of low adaptive capacity. By 2050, the southern part of the Oueme Basin will be highly vulnerable to pluvial flooding under RCP 4.5. Vulnerable municipalities will continue to suffer from flooding if adequate adaptation measures including water control infrastructure (development and expansion of rainwater and wastewater drainage systems) and appropriate early warning systems to strengthen community members' resilience are not taken.

We assessed the impact of regional climate variability for the first time on population attributes and breeding phenology and predicted its biological vulnerability through General Additive Model (GAM) in changing climatic scenario. We determined environmental cue, threshold biological condition and preferred climatic condition for breeding from lower Gangetic floodplains and Brahmaputra floodplain wetlands, India. We observed that female length at first maturity (LM50) was 10.5 cm for Brahmaputra basin and 10.8 cm for Ganga basin. Threshold Gonado-somatic index value for ready to spawn individuals (GSIspawn50) was estimated at 10.6 units for Brahmaputra and 8.11 units for Ganga basin. Temperature > 28 degrees C and rainfall >200 mm were found optimum for breeding in Ganga basin and temperature between 26 and 29 degrees C and monthly rainfall >150 mm were found optimum for Brah-maputra basin. Narrow GSIspawn50 temperature window indicated that the species is more vulnerable to climate change in Assam compared to West Bengal. Pearson correlation coefficient indicated a strong and sig-nificant correlation of gonado-somatic index (GSI) with rainfall and temperature in floodplain wetlands of both states. The population vulnerability ranged from moderate to highly vulnerable to climate change based on 14 designed attributes. Evidently, an innovative vulnerability framework developed for assessing the resilience of the species was an important effort in the Indian sub-continent. This will further help to quantify the climate induced risks which could serve as important database to develop the mitigation measures.

J	Tran, TA; Tortajada, C				Thong Anh Tran; Tortajada, Cecilia			Responding to transboundary water challenges in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: In search of institutional fit	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						climate change; hydropower development; institutional fit; transboundary environmental impacts; Vietnamese Mekong Delta	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; ADAPTATION; HYDROPOWER; DISCOURSE; FLOOD; CAPACITY; INSIGHTS; DRIVERS	The operations of large hydropower dams in the Mekong basin, while posing detrimental transboundary effects downstream, are not fully recognised in Vietnamese government policies, especially at the regional scale. This study adopts the concept of institutional fit to investigate policy gaps in addressing the transboundary water challenges characterised by falling floodwater flows and accelerating saltwater intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Based on interviews with key stakeholders (including central and provincial government officials, environmental experts, and academics) as well as desk reviews of policy documents, we argue that, while the transboundary water repercussions are increasingly evident on the ground, they are not adequately factored in water policies and strategic development planning for the delta. This study suggests that failure to incorporate co-evolving effects of climate change and Mekong-wide hydropower dynamics into local water governance will cause institutional constraints to tackle water stressors (too much or too little water) over the long term. Achieving institutional fit will therefore help align the national water policy framework with local development strategies and reduce policy-practice gaps at the delta scale. To this end, two key aspects need to be considered: first, how, and in which forms, innovative management decisions and water governance policies can be effectively undertaken towards securing the living delta and its resilience to present and future environmental risks; and second, how reframed water policy and development agendas can holistically capture and resolve the transboundary hydrological problems, while leveraging the Vietnamese government's policy engagement at higher levels to address related impacts.

J	Ha, S				Ha, Sandie			The Changing Climate and Pregnancy Health	CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS			English	Review						Climate change; Environmental disaster; Extreme weather; Pregnancy health; Perinatal health	ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY; MATERNAL EXPOSURE; FOOD INSECURITY; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE; DRINKING-WATER; NORTH-CAROLINA; INCREASED RISK	Purpose of Review Climate change is the biggest public health threat of the twenty-first century but its impact on the perinatal period has only recently received attention. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.

The study also investigated the impact of the 2009/10 floods on the livelihoods of the people of Etsha-13 Village. The "Quality of Life Approach" was operationalized, with specific focus on vulnerability and resilience to flood impacts. The study design chose purposive sampling method to select the 21 In-Depth Interviews and 3 Focus Group Discussions. The qualitative data analysis software was used for analysis. The results show that the majority of the respondents perceived local communities highly vulnerable to floods and recurring droughts. The processes post 2009/10 Etsha 13 Village flood-hazards coupled with the people's state of high vulnerability and less resilient impacted on their quality of life particularly the being, belonging and becoming components. The provision of relief to the flood victims was perceived as biased towards those known to officers providing relief. The effectiveness of the relief operations were considered inadequate. The extent of damage caused by floods is influenced by the socioeconomic factors and psycho-social challenges the affected people had prior to the natural hazard event. The majority of the victims reported that they did not recover from the flood impacts. The IKS are still important in the sustenance of the livelihoods of the local communities. To reduce risks and future catastrophes there is need for a thorough implementation of the risk reduction strategy.

The inundation depth was calculated using a two-dimensional unsteady flow model. The flood damage cost was estimated from the unit evaluation value set for each land use and prefectures and the calculated inundation depth distribution. To estimate the flood damage in the near future and the late twenty-first century, five global climate models were used. These models provided daily precipitation, and the change of the extreme precipitation was calculated. In addition to the assessment of the impacts of climate change, certain adaptation measures (land-use control, piloti building, and improvement of flood control level) were discussed, and their effects on flood damage cost reduction were evaluated. In the case of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario, the damage cost in the late twenty-first century will increase to 57% of that in the late twentieth century. However, if mitigation measures were to be undertaken according to RCP2.6 standards, the increase of the flood damage cost will stop, and the increase of the flood damage cost will be 28% of that in the late twentieth century. By implementing adaptation measures in combination rather than individually, it is possible to keep the damage cost in the future period even below that in the late twentieth century. By implementing both mitigation and adaptation measures, it is possible to reduce the flood damage cost in the late twenty-first century to 69% of that in the late twentieth century.

"What are you going to do, Protest the Wind?": Community Perceptions of Emergent and Worsening Coastal Erosion from the Remote Bering Sea Community of St. Paul, Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arctic; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Coastal management; Community perceptions; Erosion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERSPECTIVES; HEALTH; ISLAND; VARIABILITY; GOVERNANCE; STRATEGIES	The state of Alaska is experiencing increased coastal erosion due to climatic changes that threaten shoreline, infrastructure, and Alaska Native ways of life. While several Alaska Native villages have been impacted by severe erosion, additional communities face burgeoning erosion concerns. St. Paul, a remote island located in the Bering Sea, Alaska, and home to similar to 450 Unangan, or Aleut, residents, is experiencing relatively new erosion and associated flooding issues. This study aimed to inform St. Paul's erosion monitoring and climate adaptation strategies by documenting community perceptions of coastal erosion as an ecological and social threat within a broader context of multiple established climate stressors. We interviewed 21 residents to answer: (1) what are the community's perceptions of erosion on St. Paul in the context of the island's other environmental concerns?; (2) do current perceptions of erosion affect how local governing and management entities address erosion impacts?; and (3) how does erosion relate to and impact Unangan cultural traditions and heritage? Residents identified six locations of primary concern, owing to how erosion of those areas impact their culture, subsistence practices, and sense of place. We suggest methods in which local entities can better support proactive climate adaptation and mitigation measures and utilize resources for community-driven adaption planning. By documenting perspectives in Indigenous communities on emergent climate impacts, as well as perceptions of adaptation planning and implementation, it can establish the foundation for more collaborative, culturally relevant, and successful community-driven climate adaptation planning.

These positive and/or negative ecological effects may be enhanced under global change. Here, we examine the impacts of global change on aquatic alien plant introduction and/or invasions by reviewing their introduction pathways, distributions, and ecological effects. We focus on how climate change, aquatic environmental pollution, and China's rapid economic growth in recent decades affect their uses and invasiveness in China. Among 55 species of alien aquatic plants in China, 10 species are invasive, such as Eichhornia crassipes, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and Pistia stratiotes. Most of these invaders were intentionally introduced and dispersed across the country but are now widely distributed and invasive. Under climate warming, many species have expanded their distributions to areas where it was originally too cold for their survival. Thus, these species are (and will be) considered to be beneficial plants in aquaculture and for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems (for water purification) across larger areas. However, for potential invasive species, climate warming is (and will be) increasing their invasion risk in more areas. In addition, nitrogen deposition and phosphorus inputs may also alter the status of some alien species. Furthermore, climate warming has shifted the interactions between alien aquatic plants and herbivores, thus impacting their future spreads. Under climate change, more precipitation in North China and more frequent flooding in South China will increase the uncertainties of ecological effects of alien aquatic plants in these regions. We also predict that, under the continuing booming economy in China, more and more alien aquatic plants will be used for aquatic landscaping and water purification. In conclusion, our study indicates that both human activities under rapid economic growth and climate change can either increase the potential uses of alien aquatic plants or make the aquatic invaders worse in China and other areas in the world. These findings are critical for future risk assessment of aquatic plant introduction and aquatic ecosystem restoration.

Yet, the spatial and temporal variations of China's Human Displacement Risk (HDR) caused by floods remain unclear. Here, we investigated China's HDR caused by extreme floods under different global warming levels, including 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C and beyond. We developed an approach to estimate human displacement caused by floods in China. Based on this method, our findings indicate that China's HDR will increase by similar to 10.7 (similar to 11.0) times under 1.5 degrees C (2.0 degrees C) warming, and each 0.5 degrees C warming will increase HDR by 3 million on average. These great increases are mainly driven by climate change rather than population variations. Our results also reveal that the relationship between human displacement and increasing percentage of flood protection levels follows an exponential function. Additionally, we found that increasing China's current flood protection standard by similar to 46% (1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C) and similar to 59% (4.5 degrees C) would reduce future HDR to the historical period level. This study provides valuable insights into China's HDR, which can aid in adaptive flood risk management amid the trend of shifting to a warmer and more extreme climate.

Both the marsh and the rice paddy were continuously flooded, while the rice paddy was unfertilized. Average N2O emission from the marsh did not vary significantly (p > 0.05) among the vegetation communities, ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 mu g m(-2 ) h(-1). Similarly, these N2O emission rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that recorded in the rice paddy (0.7 + 2.8 [SE] mu g m(-2 )h(-1)). There was no significant correlation (p > 0.05) between environmental parameters and N2O emission. We concluded that vegetation community type does not affect N2O emission from natural tropical freshwater marshes under continuous flooding. Further, converting natural tropical freshwater marshes into continuously flooded and unfertilized rice paddies does not affect N2O emission but instead enhances carbon emission, as was depicted by the significantly lower (p > 0.05) soil organic carbon content in the rice paddy. In view of climate change mitigation, therefore, wetland management should give priority to the conservation/protection of natural wetlands.

Flood damage and flood-induced transportation interruptions inevitably affect local economic activities and generate interregional ripple effects due to the networked economy. We incorporate the impacts of transport disruptions into the interregional input-output (IRIO) model and evaluate the combined economic effects of transport disruptions and supply chain bottlenecks on the mainland of China due to a 1,000year return period storm flood scenario in Shanghai. Except for production bottlenecks, the temporary rerouting of freight flows, transport delay and transport cost change are modeled, and important adaptive behaviors such as supplier substitution and inventories are also considered. Our results show that East China may suffer more than 53.1% of China's indirect economic losses (IELs), while Shanghai's IELs account for 28%. National IELs are very sensitive to the duration of transport delay, i.e., China's IELs increase by 80.8% if the delay time increases from 3 to 14 days. These findings highlight the importance of building a resilient transportation system and strengthening the resilience of regional supply chains and have significant implications for promoting urban resilience through various resilience strategies.

By comparing the results of three control scenarios (i.e., the original control scenario, the current MPC, and the ideal MPC) under three typical rainfall events, the results demonstrate that the MPC system can effectively mitigate urban flood risk in engineering applications and the decision-making of the MPC system is valid. By comparing the control results of the MPC system under different rainfall return periods (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years), it is found that compared with the original control scenario, the total overflow is reduced by 10%, the total overflow time is reduced by 10%, or the node overflow start time is delayed by an average of 10 minutes, and the real-time control of the MPC system is only effective when the return period of the rainfall is less than three years. It is important to explore different ways of combining the MPC system and feasible capital measures to cope with urban flood risk and challenges of climate change in future works (e.g., mean sea level rise and intense rainfall).

This review aims to identify recent research, highlighting both the dynamics of landslide accidents and the characteristics of victims. From SCOPUS and WOS databases, using the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) approach, 25 articles written in English, published in the January 2010-March 2022 period and focused on landslide fatalities, were mined. The selected articles recognized a worldwide underestimation of landslide fatalities and analyzed landslide mortality from three perspectives, indicating the importance of this topic for a multidisciplinary research community. The papers focused on (a) fatal landslides and their geographic distribution, seasonality, trends, and relationships with socioeconomic indicators; (b) landslide fatalities and their behaviors and the dynamics of accidents; and (c) clinical causes of death or injury types, aiming to improve emergency rescue procedures. The gaps that emerged include (a) the insufficient reuse of valuable fatality databases; (b) the absence of simple take-home messages for citizens, practitioners, schoolteachers, and policymakers, aiming to set educational campaigns and adaptation measures; and (c) the lack of joint research projects between researchers working on landslides and doctors treating victims to provide complete research results that would be able to actually reduce landslide mortality.

Drought monitoring is a challenging subject due to its dependence on different climatic variables. To overcome this, a copula-based probabilistic multivariate drought index (MDI) has been developed which simultaneously represents the meteorological, hydrological and agricultural drought phenomenon. The four variate Archimedean copula is used in this study to integrate the precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and streamflow. Hydrologic variables like evapotranspiration, soil moisture and streamflow were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. The future MDI is also analysed to identify the impact of climate change on drought phenomenon using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 Global Climate Models under four Socio-Economic Shared Pathways. Drought characteristics like severity and duration were evaluated to identify the present and future drought events. The precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures were identified to have increasing tendencies in the future scenarios. Most of the future scenarios showed lower drought duration and severity when compared to the reference period. The drought duration and severity are likely to decrease in the future time scales especially under the high emission scenarios. The present study used a novel approach to examine the drought from various perspectives and the study will be useful for drought mitigation and adaptation strategies over the basin.

Phrasing suitable land planning strategies requires assessing future flood risk and predicting the impact of urban sprawl. This study aims to develop an innovative approach combining land use change and hydraulic models to explore future urban flood risk, aiming to reduce it under different vulnerability and exposure scenarios. SPOT-3 and Sentinel-2 images were processed and classified to create land cover maps for 1995 and 2019, and these were used to predict the 2040 land cover using the Land Change Modeler Module of Terrset. Flood risk was computed by combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability using hydrodynamic modeling and the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. We have compared flood risk in 1995, 2019, and 2040. Although flood risk increases with urbanization, population density, and the number of hospitals in the flood plain, especially in the coastal region, the area exposed to high and very high risks decreases due to a reduction in poverty rate. This study can provide a theoretical framework supporting climate change related to risk assessment in other metropolitan regions. Methodologically, it underlines the importance of using satellite imagery and the continuity of data in the planning-related decision-making process.

Some implemented strategies may only be capable of dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched. The co-benefits approach, however, opens up a 'window of opportunity' via achieving multi-goals simultaneously. Based on this, this paper aims to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island (UHI) issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China. Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated from technical, financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways to implementation are presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can enhance public participation and thereby consolidate the public-private partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach implementation, the weights of different authorities can be rebalanced to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI mitigation, can be a model for countries which have already released low-impact development water management practices, and may also provide references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze treatment for UHI mitigation.

Recent studies have revealed that typhoons will be stronger and more powerful in a future warmer climate and be a threat to lives and properties. In this study, we conduct downscaling experiments of an extreme rain-producing typhoon, Typhoon Lionrock (2016), to assess the impacts of climate change on resulting hazards by assuming pseudo global warming (PGW) conditions. The downscaled precipitations over the landfall region in the present climate condition agree well with the Radar-Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (Radar-AMeDAS) observations. A typhoon track in the future climate similar to that in the present climate is successfully reproduced, with a stronger wind speed (by similar to 20 knots) and lower central pressure (by similar to 20 hPa) under the PGW condition. The changes in precipitation amounts associated with the typhoon under PGW condition are analyzed over seven individual prefectures in the northern part of Japan. The typhoon in the warming climate produces more precipitation over all prefectures. Iwate, Aomori, Akita, Miyagi, and Hokkaido are projected to have relatively more precipitation associated with the typhoon in the warming climate. The overall analysis suggests that Typhoon Lionrock under PGW may increase the risk of flooding, damages to infrastructures, and lives staying along the typhoon track.

We have identified 189 of disappeared, displaced and partially affected villages (in the area between Siret and Prut Rivers), using old cartographic materials as primary tool, and overlapping them with the present situation: ortophoto imagery and LiDAR derived high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The main natural hazards that affected the settlements were landslides (63%), floods (26%) and river bank erosion processes (11%) and in 19% of the cases the settlement completely disappeared. We also present seven study cases, three for landslides, three for floods and one for river bank erosion in order to detail how these natural hazards impacted the physical environment of the settlements. In the Moldavian Plateau the mentioned natural hazards played an important role in the dynamics of the settlement network, with variations induced mainly by the socio-political characteristics and not necessarily by the frequency variation of the natural hazard events. Such studies are needed in order to depict the vulnerability and risk scenarios, especially for the back-analysis, but also considering that future climate changes might impose changes in hazard, vulnerability and risk associated to settlements.

Results show that preparedness in nearly pristine systems is noticeably different to that reported for altered systems. People adopt innovative and simple but efficient measures against floods, conditioned by (1) damage suffered during past floods, (2) perceived exposure to floods, and (3) the number of dependent people in the household. The studied system proved to be well adapted to floods but not resilient. Studying attributes that explain preparedness as part of flood risk management plans would contribute towards uncertainty reduction in risk calculations and increase the safety of goods and people from floods.

This study took into account the concept of vulnerability of the International Panel on Climate Change. The index of climate vulnerability of agriculture was developed on the basis of three indicators: exposure (climate variability and extreme weather events), sensitivity (threats due to natural conditions, changes in agriculture, vitality of the population) and adaptive capacity (income, sustainable management and natural resources). Climate vulnerability of agriculture was quantitatively analyzed with vulnerability indicators through the statistical regions of the Republic of Slovenia, and thus contributed to the regionally oriented approaches that seek to answer the challenges of climate vulnerability of agriculture in Slovenia. The results show higher climate vulnerability of agriculture in the western and central Slovenia and lower vulnerability in the eastern and northeastern part of the country.

Despite the existence of numerous case studies, assessing the precise contributions of individual cities to this global trend has proven challenging, primarily due to the daunting task of collecting census data for thousands of cities. The study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the recent urban expansion in more than 6000 cities, utilizing state-of-the-art long-term datasets of urban impervious surface area (ISA), population, gross domestic product (GDP) data, and a global city boundary. By tracking the changes in ISA, population, and GDP, we assessed the magnitude and direction (increasing or decreasing) of these variables over time at both the global level and across different regions and countries. Through correlation analysis, we established statistical relationships between urban expansion and GDP growth as well as population change. Furthermore, we examined the profits of these cities and evaluated the projected flood risks they faced. Through the study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis and revealed detailed characteristics, patterns, and disparities in city development, economic output, population density, as well as the profits and projected flood risks across cities, countries, and regions. This in-depth un-derstanding of recent urban expansion provides valuable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders to actively promote sustainable urban development and effectively manage associated risks in diverse geographical contexts.

Proper assessment of natural hazards at an early planning stage can give large cost savings and safer roads. In assessing natural hazards along 720 km of planned roads in Norway, a GIS-based tool was developed to utilize publicly available data and dynamic runout models. The output is an outline of the most critical locations and serves to limit the extent of necessary field work. The Norwegian national susceptibility maps are generally conservative and using only these in the planning would give unrealistically high hazard levels. Various optimizing techniques were therefore implemented in the GIS tool and the outputs further calibrated against existing detailed hazard maps in selected locations and further validated during field work at the defined 'hotspots'. The field work comprised assessing return periods of unwanted events, probable road closure time, and relevant mitigation measures, all within sets of pre-defined ranges of values. The following consequence evaluation quantified the indirect economic consequences of closed road and assessed the consequence for emergency preparedness qualitatively. Other consequences were not considered in the study. Climate change was considered and evaluated to affect the probability for flooding and debris flows, whereas the link between climate change and the other assessed hazards was considered too uncertain to impact on the risk estimates.

Study focus: Understanding the accuracy of rainfall forecasts in the data-scarce urban catchment has a multitude of benefits given the increased urban flood risk caused by climate change and urbanization. In this study, accuracy of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model rainfall forecast was evaluated using citizen science data. Categorical and continuous accuracy evaluation metrics were used beside gauge representativeness effect.New hydrological insights for the region: The rainfall forecasts performance accuracy is high for 1-3 -days lead-time but deteriorates for 4-5-days lead-time. The WRF model captured the temporal dynamics and the rainfall amount according to the estimated KGE values. The model has rela-tively higher detection performance for no rain and light rain events (< 6 mm/day), but it has lower performance for moderate and heavy rain events (> 6 mm/day). Use of data from a single rain gauge misrepresents the accuracy level of the rainfall forecast in the study area. The gauge representativeness error contributed a variance of 28.08-83.33 % to the variance of WRF-gauge rainfall difference. Thus, the use of citizen science rainfall monitoring program is an essential alternative source of information where in-situ rainfall monitoring is limited that can be used to understand the "true" accuracy of WRF rainfall forecasts.

It is currently experiencing high rates of relative sea-level rise of about 5 mm/year, reflecting anthropogenic climate change and land subsidence. This is expected to accelerate further through the 21st Century, so there are concerns that the GBM delta will be progressively submerged. In this context, a core question is: can sedimentation on the delta surface maintain its elevation relative to sea level? This research seeks to answer this question by applying a two-dimensional flow and morphological model which is capable of handling dynamic interactions between the river and floodplain systems and simulating floodplain sedimentation under different flow-sediment regimes and anthropogenic interventions. We find that across a range of flood frequencies and adaptation scenarios (including the natural polder-free state), the retained volume of sediment varies between 22% and 50% of the corresponding sediment input. This translates to average rates of sedimentation on the delta surface of 5.5 mm/yr to 7.5 mm/yr. Hence, under present conditions, sedimentation associated with quasi-natural conditions can exceed current rates of relative sea-level rise and potentially create new land mass. These findings highlight that encouraging quasi-natural conditions through the widespread application of active sediment management measures has the potential to promote more sustainable outcomes for the GBM delta. Practical measures to promote include tidal river management, and appropriate combinations of cross-dams, bandal-like structures, and dredging.	[Rahman, Md.

Hard infrastructure, known as gray infrastructure (e.g. concrete seawalls), has commonly been used to protect coastal communities but is expensive to build, maintain, and deteriorates coastal vegetation. Green infrastructure (e.g. restored or conserved mangrove and marsh ecosystems) delivers nature-based coastal protection but in comparatively lower density coastal areas. Nowadays a more popularized approach to coastal protection is hybrid eco-engineering. In this study, we discuss lessons-learnt on how the hybridization of engineered structures and wetland restoration practices compared with traditional gray and green approaches. We contrast hybrid applications in mangrove and tidal marsh areas in the UK and south-east Asia. The majority (70%) of successful hybrid infrastructure cases were underpinned by understanding of ecological and hydrological changes in response to infrastructure and involved a wide range of stakeholders. In terms of construction and maintenance cost, limited data suggested that hybrid infrastructure may be more cost effective than gray infrastructure, but more expensive than green; however, data were very limited and therefore we suggest the need for further cost-benefit analyses to inform a robust comparison. Development of new technologies should see growing efficacy of future hybrid infrastructure in mitigating coastal flood risks.

Autonomous adaptive measures are behaviors that the population adopts without explicit planning or the assistance of either institutions, professionals, or both, all of which are focused on protecting themselves from risks. This research focuses near the part of superficial drainage channels, which is divided into five areas. Visits to the study area and interviews with residents allowed to identify urban typologies and autonomous adaptive constructive techniques, as well as the relationship between these forms of adaptation and the socioeconomic conditions of the population. The main results are associated with the main motivations, information and knowledge that support flood adaptation strategies and the consequences of their success or failure in Amazonian cities. Some of them indicates that autonomous flood adaptation measures were not provided with professional technical assistance or externally financed; the measures are associated with structural modifications (e.g., raise the level of the properties and improve the building) and non-structural modifications (e.g., shims). Some of the conclusions are associated with sources of information; community recognition of flood adaptation methods; motivation to the measures implemented autonomously; consequence to the urban planning and people internal migration, and the difficulties to identify and characterize an adaptation measure as proactive or reactive in recurrent flood cycles in Amazonian cities.

The prosperous Longshan culture of northern Shaanxi has revised our traditional understanding of the border areas from that time. This paper explores regional differences through time within the Longshan culture, from northern Shaanxi, the Guanzhong Basin, and southern central Inner Mongolia. We examine potential climatic and environmental factors that may have influenced cultural development. Modern climatic characteristics show that hydrological conditions are best-suited for human occupation in the Guanzhong Basin, followed by those of northern Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia. Based on paleoclimate analyses, we identify asynchronous climate transitions from a relatively warm-humid middle Holocene to a cold-dry climate in the late Holocene. These changes occurred at 5.0 ka, 3.8 ka and 3.0-3.3 ka BP, starting in the north and ending in the south. Prehistoric humans from the Inner Mongolia region began to move southward around 4.5 ka BP, coincident with the northernmost climate transition. Frequent flooding in the Guanzhong Basin, perhaps due to a coincidence between Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and La Nina conditions, led to the migration or diffusion of many individuals away from the basin. The favorable climate in northern Shaanxi at the time contributed to its success and prosperity.

Volatile emissions, both from magmatic degassing and vaporized from surrounding rock, triggered short-term cooling and longer-term warming, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation. The magnitude of biological extinction varied considerably, from small events affecting only select groups to the largest extinction of the Phanerozoic, with less-active organisms and those with less-developed respiratory physiology faring especially poorly. The disparate environmental and biological outcomes of different flood basalt events may at first order be explained by variations in the rate of volatile release modulated by longer trends in ocean carbon cycle buffering and the composition of marine ecosystems. Assessing volatile release, environmental change, and biological extinction at finer temporal resolution should be a top priority to refine ancient hyperthermals as analogs for anthropogenic climate change. Flood basalts, the largest volcanic events in Earth history, triggered dramatic environmental changes on land and in the oceans. Rapid volcanic carbon emissions led to ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation that often caused widespread animal extinctions. Animal physiology played a key role in survival during flood basalt extinctions, with reef builders such as corals being especially vulnerable. The rate and duration of volcanic carbon emission controlled the type of environmental disruption and the severity of biological extinction.

J	Siders, AR				Siders, A. R.			Social justice implications of US managed retreat buyout programs	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							POLICY; RECONSTRUCTION; ADAPTATION; KATRINA	Global climate change poses significant risks to coastal and riverine communities. Managed retreat, the purposeful movement of people and infrastructure out of vulnerable floodplains, is one possible adaptation strategy. The USA has already engaged in a limited amount of retreat by providing federal funds to purchase and demolish or relocate vulnerable properties. As retreat programs are expected to expand in size and frequency to address the increased risks posed by climate change, a review of how such property acquisition programs have been implemented is timely. Specifically, decisions made by government officials regarding where to acquire properties have significant potential social justice implications, as buyouts could promote or reduce existing social inequities, but it is unclear how such decisions are being made. A review of eight US buyout programs suggests that buyouts, as practiced, lack transparency, which may increase public distrust of the process and reduce participation. Moreover, decisions often involve political motivations and rely on cost-benefit logic that may promote disproportionate retreat in low-income or minority communities, continuing historic patterns of social inequity. However, as low-income communities in the USA also tend to be highly vulnerable to climate-exacerbated hazards, a decision not to relocate may also promote disproportionate harm. The buyout programs reviewed provide examples of how to mitigate these concerns through increased transparency, emphasis on relocation, explicit focus on social inequality, longer-term and larger-scale holistic approaches, and participatory pre-disaster planning. Further research on past programs is needed to evaluate outcomes and processes to improve future adaptation efforts.	[Siders, A.

J	Ye, AL; Wang, ZZ; Zhang, LL; Wang, LH; Wang, K				Ye, Ailing; Wang, Zongzhi; Zhang, Lingling; Wang, Lihui; Wang, Kun			Assessment approach to the floodwater utilization potential of a basin and an empirical analysis from China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Floodwater utilization; Floodwater utilization potential; Floodwater utilization status; Evaluation methods; Nansi lake basin	LIMITED WATER-LEVEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESERVOIR OPERATION; FRAMEWORK MODEL; DYNAMIC CONTROL; RESOURCES; UNCERTAINTY; HYDROLOGY; SYSTEM	Water stress is increasingly intense all over the world owing to rapid economic development and global climate change. Floodwater utilization can mitigate water shortages and provide multiple water use benefits. The priority of evaluating the utilization status and potential of floodwater should be taken into account at a basin scale. However, few studies have focused on the assessment approach. This paper argues that the amount of available floodwater is a function of the ability to regulate and utilize floodwater, and that floodwater can be classified into two parts: unavailable floodwater and available floodwater. Based on this definition, the logical relationships among current floodwater utilization potential, theoretical floodwater utilization potential, and the current and theoretical amounts of available floodwater in a basin were derived using limit analysis theory. The concepts and evaluation methods of basin floodwater utilization were unified in this paper. Finally, the status and potential of floodwater utilization of the Nansi Lake Basin were evaluated. The results showed that the current and theoretical amounts of available floodwater were 1629-1808millionm(3) and 2050-2155millionm(3), respectively, and the current and theoretical amounts of floodwater utilization potential were 266-386millionm(3) and 678-733millionm(3), respectively. The application in the Nansi Lake Basin offers some practical information for assessing floodwater utilization scientifically and provides some significant guidelines for other basins.

Examples of interaction between extreme weather and built environment assets are broken down via systems thinking. The concept of unconscious bias is addressed in how infrastructure climate risk is diagnosed; beyond the effects of flooding, drought, and heatwaves. Differentiations between climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation are made. Opportunities to address each throughout the infrastructure lifecycle are discussed, including how to balance conflicts of interest between them.

J	Rözer, V; Mehryar, S; Surminski, S				Rozer, Viktor; Mehryar, Sara; Surminski, Swenja			From managing risk to increasing resilience: a review on the development of urban flood resilience, its assessment and the implications for decision making	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Review						flood resilience; urban; decision making	SEA-LEVEL RISE; COASTAL CITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEMS; CITY; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; LESSONS	Driven by urban growth in hazard prone areas such as along coasts or rivers as well as by climate change induced sea-level rise and increase in extreme rainfall, flood risk in urban areas is increasing. Better understanding of risks, risk drivers and its consequences in urban areas have revealed shortcomings in the existing flood risk management approaches. This has led to a paradigm shift in dealing with floods from managing the risk to reduce damages, to making urban communities resilient to flooding. Often described as a complex and at times confusing concept, this systematic review identifies and summarises the different dimensions and approaches of urban flood resilience and how they are applied in practice. Our analysis shows that urban flood resilience as a concept has evolved over the last two decades. From an engineering concept with a strong focus on ensuring that the built environment can withstand a flood to a more recent definition as a transformative process with the aim to enable all parts of the urban system to live with floods and learn from previous shocks. This evolved understanding is also reflected in the increasing number of dimensions considered in urban flood resilience assessments and decision support tools. A thematic analysis of the challenges in conceptualising and applying urban flood resilience reported in the literature has revealed a number of issues including around fairness and equity of the applied approaches, a lack of data and widely accepted methods as well as uncertainty around changing risks as a result of climate change. Based on these findings we propose a new research agenda, focusing on meta studies to identify the key dimensions and criteria for urban flood resilience, supporting a transparent and evidence-led operationalization.

This study used multiple methods including trend and abrupt analysis, correlation analysis, water-balance analysis, and hydrochemical analysis to evaluate the hydrogeological processes and hydrochemical effects in 5 periods in the Manas River catchment, a typical arid inland catchment in China. The results show that groundwater storage in the catchment decreased by 5.45 x 108 m3 over the past 60 years, while glacial melt, snowmelt, and precipitation showed an increasing trend since the 1980 s. A drop in the groundwater level in the alluvial fan and a 28 % reduction in spring discharge in the lower alluvial fan since 1959 were caused by reduced river infiltration owing to the water diversion projects. Mean-while, the concentrations of SO42-and Cl- in the alluvial fan groundwater have more than doubled over the period 1957-2018 as a result of the decrease of both groundwater level and flow rate. Long-term over-exploitation of groundwater associated with irrigation after 1978 strongly depleted the groundwater storage and altered the flow path of groundwater in the oasis zone. In addition, the expansion of arable land and increased temperatures enhanced evapotranspiration and salinization of shallow groundwater in the oasis and desert zones. Based on the results, we propose making full use of natural underground reservoirs to increase infiltration of river water and flood water in the alluvial fan zone, and reducing the arable land area to ensure the sustainability of water resources and ecology in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment. The results will provide reference for the sustainable development of water resources and environmental protection in arid inland regions and similar catchments worldwide.

Climatic and socioeconomic change are expected to further increase the amount of loss in the future. To counteract this development, policymaking, and adaptation plan-ning need reliable large-scale risk assessments and an improved understanding of potential risk drivers.In this study, recent datasets for hazard and flood protection standards are combined with high resolution exposure projections and attributes of vulnerability derived from open data sources. The independent and combined influence of exposure change and climate scenarios rcp45 and rcp85 on fluvial flood risk are evaluated for three future periods centered around 2025, 2055 and 2085. Scenarios with improved and neglected private precaution are examined for their influence on flood risk using a probabilistic, multivariable flood loss model - BN-FLEMOps - to estimate fluvial flood losses for residential buildings in Europe.The results on NUTS-3 level reveal that urban centers and their surrounding regions are the hotspots of flood risk in Europe. Flood risk is projected to increase in the British Isles and Central Europe throughout the 21st century, while risk in many regions of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean will stagnate or decline. Under the combined effects of exposure change and climate scenarios rcp45, rcp85, fluvial flood risk in Europe is estimated to increase seven-fold and ten-fold respectively until the end of the century. Our results confirm the dominance of socioeconomic change over climate change on increasing risk. Improved private precautionary measures would reduce flood risk in Europe on an average by 15%. The quantification of future flood risk in Europe by integrating climate, socioeconomic and private precaution scenarios provides an overview of risk drivers, trends, and hot -spots. This large-scale comprehensive assessment at a regional level resolution is valuable for multi-scale risk -based adaptation planning.

This study determined how CIS use by men and women farmers may be influenced by their perceptions about climate change (CC), farm activities, and demography. The study was carried out at the Lawra-Jirapa Districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana where downscaled seasonal forecast information through mobile phone technologies (Esoko platform) had been disseminated to farmers since 2011. Data was collected from semi-structured questionnaire interviews involving 900 farmers (50.2% women and 49.8% men) and four 20-member focus group discussions. The study confirmed 85.2% (representing 767) farmers were aware of climate change and its implications for their agriculture and other livelihood activities. Men and women had similar perceptions about climate change, perceived by the majority as increased strong winds, higher temperatures, increased frequency of drought, increased rainfall variability and increased flooding. Among other factors, it was evident that use of CIS may be influenced by gender. Men were found to be particularly responsive in adopting CIS use for climate risk mitigation. This was attributed to their ability to easily access and use telephone devices compared with women. The study revealed that unlike women, men were able to access more financial resources and had control of household income which allowed them to purchase mobile phones. Women generally accessed their husbands' mobile phones. Despite differences in access to CIS, the study showed both men and women found it beneficial for strategic farm decision-making such as when to begin land preparation, when to plant, and which crop to select. In addition, both men and women were found to face similar constrains (such as poor network connectivity and limited of training), to accessing and using CIS through the Esoko platform. The study recommends the need to explore different CIS dissemination channels and design CIS that meet gender-specific needs.

In this study, we utilize wavelet coherence together with continuous wavelet transform to analyze the influence of SSN and ENSO on multiple interacting hydrological processes and distinguish nonstationary patterns in annual precipitation and extreme precipitation events and their effects on short-term or long-term streamflow variations and periodic flooding in Xinjiang, an arid-semiarid region of China. The results indicate that the climate in Xinjiang has become wetter during the period 1960-2019. Extreme precipitation events in Xinjiang have significant oscillation periods at the 2-4 years band, and stations with strong extreme precipitation events are located in northern Xinjiang and Tianshan mountain area, while stations with weak extreme precipitation events are found in southern Xinjiang. The annual precipitation has significant multiple-periodicities at the 2-7-year band, at the 7-11-year band, and at the 13-15-year band. Furthermore, annual streamflow data for nine natural rivers all have significant dominant periodicities at inter-annual scale of 2-4-year and 4-7-year band, and monthly streamflow data for Yarkand river has significant periodicities at intra-annual scale of 3-7-month and 8-14-month band. Since evolution of annual streamflow variability and monthly streamflow variability all show direct response to precipitation features, increasing extreme precipitation events significantly affect streamflow fluctuation of natural rivers in Xinjiang. Overall, SSN and ENSO is viewed as one of the main drivers for annual precipitation or extreme precipitation periodic variation by either enhancing or suppressing convection, and the SSN and ENSO-modulated precipitation anomaly contributes to significant streamflow variation or regional flooding disasters. Investigating the detailed linkage between interannual to multidecadal climate variability and hydrometeorological variables will help decision-makers and scientists to better understand variability in regional hydrological processes, which has great implications for water resources planning and operations in Xinjiang under future climate uncertainty.

Influence of maximum water level and coastal inundation on the east of coast India based on future tropical cyclones	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Storm surge; Tropical cyclones; Climate change; Vardah cyclone; Madi cyclone; Sea level rise; Inundation extent; RCP scenarios	STORM-SURGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE WAVES; BAY; MODEL; RISE; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTIONS; PHAILIN	The present paper investigates the impact of future scenarios for the past two storms (namely, Vardah and Madi). These two storms had a different intensity over Bay of Bengal, India. The recent study in this region shows that the influence of these Tropical Cyclones (TC) may be severe in future climatic conditions. Different future Representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios are investigated in this study. The combined sea level rise (SLR) and high wind intensity in future scenarios has been investigated in the present study for their influence on maximum water level (MWL), wave climate and coastal inundations. The coupled surge and wave models are used to analyze the influence of SLR and wind intensity for different RCPs. The variations of MWL and inundation extent with increase and decrease in wind increment for different RCPs of the TC's were reported. Overall, for the Far Future RCP 8.5 scenario, the relative percentage of difference (compared to the current scenario) in MWL has increased by 135% for TC Vardah and 180% for TC Madi. Further, the flood area for TC's Vardah and Madi will increase by 70% and 95% compared to the current scenario. Finally, the study reveals that the extreme wind intensity of the TC's in future scenarios plays a significant contribution of up to 50% in coastal inundations.

J	Peters, MK; Kusimi, JM				Peters, Michael Kwame; Kusimi, John Manyimadin			Changes in wetland and other landscape elements of the Keta Municipal area of Ghana	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Land disturbance; Land use and land cover change; Keta; Remote sensing; Wetlands	LAND-COVER CHANGE; DISTURBANCE	Coastal landscapes, including coastal wetlands around the world, are increasingly facing devastating threats and disasters due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes and coastal processes occasioned by climate change. The coastal zone of Keta and the municipality in general are affected by human activities and geomorphological processes such as sea erosion and flooding which are upsetting the condition of the coastal wetland, the vegetal cover and other landscape features of the locality. The rationale of the study was to estimate the transformations in LULC in the wetlands and general landscape from 1991 to 2018 and investigate the driving forces behind the LULC changes. This can help wetlands managers to develop well-tailored policies towards sustainable management of wetlands in Ghana. To achieve this, the study carried out a LULC analysis using Landsat data of 1991, 2005 and 2018. The study established that, there has been a changing pattern in the major LULC types, except for bare lands. Wetlands reduced in coverage from 182.33 km(2) to 135.11 km(2) while farmlands showed a continuous increase in landmass. Increased anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, farming and geomorphic processes such as sea erosion and tidal inundation owing to climate change are the key drivers of the transformations of the landscape of the locality. Enforcement of the national wetlands conservation policy, planting of mangroves in the wetlands and the afforestation of other degraded lands of the municipality will restore the ecosystem and protect the landscape.

The challenges of climate change are multipronged, resulting in melting glaciers, flash floods, and severe heat waves. In this regard, the adaptive and mitigation strategies to manage the consequences of climate change are highly important. The transport sector creates a quarter of carbon emissions, and this share is continuously increasing. Accordingly, this research study uses transport competitiveness to determine carbon emissions of the transport sector for 121 countries covering the time period from 2008 to 2018. The Panel Quantile Regression (PQR) technique is engaged to analyze the study results. The findings highlight that transport competitiveness tends to increase carbon emissions of the transport sector across quantile groups 1 and 3, while it reduces carbon emissions in quantile group 2. The U-shaped services' EKC is validated in quantile groups 2 and 4. The moderation engaged, i.e., transportation competitiveness, changes the turning point of the services' EKC across quantile groups 2 and 4. However, in the high-CO2 quantile group, the moderation impact of transport competitiveness is strongest as it reduces the sensitivity by flattening the services' EKC. Furthermore, the planned expansion of the population and improved institutional quality tend to mitigate carbon emissions across different quantile groups. The policy relevance/implications that are based on the study results/findings are made part of the research paper.

Landscape response to hydroclimate variability shown by the post-Bonneville Flood (ca. 18 ka) fluvial-geomorphic history of the middle Snake River, Idaho, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Latest Pleistocene; Holocene; Snake River; Paleohydrology; Hydroclimate variability; Fluvial aggradation	PLEISTOCENE LAKE BONNEVILLE; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; MULTIPLE PROXY RECORDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROVO SHORELINE; GREAT-BASIN; GRAND-TETON; HOLOCENE; CHRONOLOGY; DEPOSITS	The fluvial geomorphology and stratigraphy on the middle Snake River at Bancroft Springs, Idaho, provide evidence for numerous episodes of Snake River aggradation and incision since the Bonneville Flood at ca. 18 ka. A suite of seven terraces ranging from 20-1 m above modern bankfull elevation records multiple cut-and-fill cycles during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene in response to local base-level controls, variations in sediment supply, and hydroclimate change. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating show that the ages of fluvial aggradation generally coincide with increased sediment supply and likely wetter hydroclimate during onset of the Younger Dryas stadial (ca. 13.2 ka), deglaciation and termination of the Younger Dryas stadial (ca. 11.3 ka), Early Holocene cooling (ca. 8.8 ka), and Neoglacial (ca. 4.5, 2.9, 1.1 ka). Six intervening periods of incision and channel stability may also reflect either reduced sediment supply, drier hydroclimate, or both. The terrace chronology can be correlated to a variety of local and regional paleoclimate proxy records and corresponds well with periods of continental- and global-scale rapid climate change during the Holocene. The fluvial record demonstrates the geomorphic response and sensitivity of large river systems to changes in hydroclimate variability, which has important implications for inferring paleoenvironmental conditions in the region.

Prior to using simulations, some corrections must be made. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of simple and complex correction approaches on CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) precipitation datasets over Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, India. The various bias correction approaches were assessed using the two-sample cross-validation technique, and the best method was chosen using statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and percent bias for correcting the future scenario datasets. According to the findings, all methods significantly improved raw simulated estimations after correction. The Delta Change method was used to adjust the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios datasets for this study region because it produced good agreement (0.98) and low wet bias (1%) against observed precipitation. In addition, this study found that the annual mean precipitation projections showed an increase in precipitation intensity of between 4.2 and 6.8% under the RCP2.6 scenario and between 14 and 20.1% under the RCP8.5 scenario, compared to observed data (1976-2005). Furthermore, the analysis showed that most years in the twenty-first century will experience heavy precipitation, resulting in floods. This research has offered reliable knowledge about future precipitation to environmentalists, urban administrators, and policy-makers, enable them to make plausible strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change.

How to prioritize species recovery after a megafire	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						actions; Australia; bushfire impacts; climate change; conservation; fire	TRADE-OFFS; CONSERVATION; FIRE; COMPLEMENTARITY; DIVERSITY; AREAS; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; RESPONSES	Due to climate change, megafires are increasingly common and have sudden, extensive impacts on many species over vast areas, leaving decision makers uncertain about how best to prioritize recovery. We devised a decision-support framework to prioritize conservation actions to improve species outcomes immediately after a megafire. Complementary locations are selected to extend recovery actions across all fire-affected species' habitats. We applied our method to areas burned in the 2019-2020 Australian megafires and assessed its conservation advantages by comparing our results with outcomes of a site-richness approach (i.e., identifying areas that cost-effectively recover the most species in any one location). We found that 290 threatened species were likely severely affected and will require immediate conservation action to prevent population declines and possible extirpation. We identified 179 subregions, mostly in southeastern Australia, that are key locations to extend actions that benefit multiple species. Cost savings were over AU$300 million to reduce 95% of threats across all species. Our complementarity-based prioritization also spread postfire management actions across a wider proportion of the study area compared with the site-richness method (43% vs. 37% of the landscape managed, respectively) and put more of each species' range under management (average 90% vs. 79% of every species' habitat managed). In addition to wildfire response, our framework can be used to prioritize conservation actions that will best mitigate threats affecting species following other extreme environmental events (e.g., floods and drought).

However, the local conditions that make these communities vulnerable are poorly understood and knowledge on which communities are most vulnerable is lacking. This study improves the conceptual understanding of different dimensions of vulnerability that exist across the communities and the various levels of vulnerability that each exposed community exhibits. The study surveyed 354 household heads from selected flood-prone communities including Blekusu, Agavedzi, Salakope, Amutsinu, and Adina. The survey collected data on demographic, social, economic, physical, exposure, and adaptive capacity to flood hazards. The data was then used to construct composite vulnerability indices at community levels. Results from the study demonstrate that the communities have different levels of vulnerability as a result of differences in their exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity levels. The willingness to relocate as an adaptation strategy was determined by household flood duration, number of livelihoods, and sea defence preference. These results are relevant to flood disaster management programs and the adoption of effective adaptation measures that take into account local knowledge. The findings imply that interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability should take into account household characteristics, as well as flood exposure, and adaptive capacity factors.

Its tributaries include the Mun River (NE Thailand), which often experiences extreme water events. In this study, the streamflow change in the year 2115 was simulated by relying on the Half-a-Degree Additional Warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) experiment and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5) climate model for average global warming of 1.5 degrees C (Plus1.5) and 2.0 degrees C (Plus2.0) above pre-industrial levels and compared with the base year in 2015 for the Mun River Basin. The Soil-Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for the streamflow simulation. The results showed an increasing air temperature against lowering rainfall and relative humidity (except for the post-monsoon months), suggesting overall rain suppression in response to the warming climate. The median projected annual streamflow to the Mekong River in 2115 decreased for both 'Plus1.5' (-32.5%, median) and 'Plus2.0' (-23.1%, median). However, increasing annual streamflow could be found only in the middle part. Seasonal streamflow changes revealed a different spatiotemporal response to climate change resulting in inconsistent streamflow changes across the basin. The adaptive measures for the middle part should be focused on flooding control, whereas the upper and the lower parts should be against drought.

J	Ayzel, G				Ayzel, Georgy			Machine Learning Reveals a Significant Shift in Water Regime Types Due to Projected Climate Change	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						water regime; machine learning; Random Forest; climate change; northwest Russia	HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; DIFFERENT REGIONS; CHANGE IMPACT; CLASSIFICATION; STREAMFLOW; RUNOFF	A water regime type is a cumulative representation of seasonal runoff variability in a textual, qualitative, or quantitative form developed for a particular period. The assessment of the respective water regime type changes is of high importance for local communities and water management authorities, increasing their awareness and opening strategies for adaptation. In the presented study, we trained a machine learning model-the Random Forest classifier-to predict water regime types in northwest Russia based on monthly climatological hydrographs derived for a historical period (1979-1991). Evaluation results show the high efficiency of the trained model with an accuracy of 91.6%. Then, the Random Forest model was used to predict water regime types based on runoff projections for the end of the 21st century (2087-2099) forced by four different General Circulation Models (GCM) and three Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP). Results indicate that climate is expected to modify water regime types remarkably. There are two primary directions of projected changes. First, we detect the tendency towards less stable summer and winter flows. The second direction is towards a shift in spring flood characteristics. While spring flooding is expected to remain the dominant phase of the water regime, the flood peak is expected to shift towards earlier occurrence and lower magnitude. We identified that the projected changes in water regime types are more pronounced in more aggressive RCP scenarios.

We present the first tree-ring delta O-18 based hydroclimatic reconstruction for northern semi-arid Iran spanning the period 1515-2015. A highly significant correlation between tree-ring delta O-18 variations of juniper trees and spring (April-June) precipitation reveals a major influence of spring water availability during the early growing season. The driest period of the past 501 years occurred in the 16th century while the 18th century was the wettest, during which the overall highest frequency of wet year events occurred. A gradual decline in spring precipitation is evident from the beginning of the 19th century, pointing to even drier climate conditions. The analysis of dry/wet events indicates that the frequency of years with relatively dry spring increased over the last three centuries, while the number of wet events decreased. Our findings are in accordance with historical Persian disaster records (e.g., the severe droughts of 1870-1872, 1917-1919; severe flooding of 1867, the 1930s, and 1950). Correlation analyses between the reconstruction and different atmospheric circulation indices revealed no significant influence of large-scale drivers on spring precipitation in northern Iran.

Study focus: The Brenta and Bacchiglione rivers suffer from an increasing pressure in terms of flood events, especially for urban sprawl, anthropogenic modifications of drainage networks, and climate change. Finding and implementing effective remedies is hard in developed countries due to the presence of several constraints. Optimal flood management in complex river networks is then a way to reduce flood hazard, at a relatively low cost compared to structural measures. Hence, optimal operation rules for floodgates at an existing control structure are searched for to control the upstream water level and to divert a proper amount of the Bacchiglione discharge into the Brenta River. The operation rules have been endorsed by the Civil Engineering Department in charge of flood management and have been implemented in the flood forecasting Early Warning System of the Regional Civil Protection Office. New hydrological insights: The proper operation of control structures allows reducing flood risk by balancing the water discharge in the river networks. The engagement of end-users proves beneficial as it fosters exchange of knowledge and allows for the effective adoption of research outcomes in decision making.

The present study comprises significant implications for both the impact of climate changes on fluvial systems in the timescales of the Milankovitch band and the controversial age and rate of the crustal extension in western Anatolia. Our findings indicate that LOI950 and delta O-18(carb), which are indicators for the amount of soil carbonate and paleo-temperature respectively are collectively capable of distinguishing between glacial and interglacial periods in the predominantly floodplain deposits of the graben infill. Secondarily, LOI550 and delta C-13(carb) values further help this discrimination via primary production and composition of vegetation cover respectively. Pollen data, albeit highly discontinuous due to poor preservation under subaerial conditions, point out a steppe-like vegetation cover where the forest components expand particularly in the wet interglacial periods. In the other hand, the chronological frame provided by astronomical calibration of certain proxy-records strongly suggest that the Eskisehir Fault Zone initiated as a boundary fault of a half-graben some 900 ka. The rate of vertical movement on its southern branch since the last 70 ka is unexpectedly high (2.3 mm a), a phenomenon that requires urgent risk assessment analysis in the vicinity of the Eskisehir city.

The high resolution MeteOcean Re-Analysis database by the Department of Civil, Chemical and Environmental Engineering (DICCA) was used. At yearly and seasonal scales, the trends of the mean and maximum values were detected by the Mann-Kendall test, choosing a significance level equal to 90%. The slope or increase/decrease trends in Hs and Tp were assessed by the Theil-Sen estimator. For the mean values of Hs and Tp, increasing trends were detected for the Libyan, Levantine and Aegean seas, while for the maximum values this increasing trend was observed in a large part of the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, for the different marginal seas of the Mediterranean basin, a running trend analysis was applied in order to quantify the effect of the time window in the trend detection. The obtained results can be significant for flooding and erosion control strategies, ship and port operations, design and verification of structures, installations of Wave Energy Converters, in a hot spot for climate change such as the Mediterranean basin.

In this article, a debris flow disaster chain in Southwest China caused damage to buildings along the river bank was investigated. The disaster chain included a debris flow, river blockage, lake formation, and an outbreak flood, and this study further investigated the disaster-related losses in downstream villages. Based on the characteristics of failed buildings, three structural types were identified, while the functions of undamaged buildings were affected by flooding or siltation by sediments. In addition, the building layout and riparian vegetation zone influenced the blockage effect, which resisted the flood impact and provided protection to rear buildings. Moreover, this disaster changed the river topography, the studied reach changed from a V shape to a wide-shallow shape, the appreciably affected river length was 6270 m, and the gully bed was noticeably raised 15-20 m. Furthermore, the flood control standard of a 50-year return period was recommended for reference, despite the limitations of these suggestions, we hope that this study attracts the attention of researchers on disaster prevention and mitigation in remote rural areas.

Progress and challenges in glacial lake outburst flood research (2017-2021): a research community perspective	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							MORAINE-DAMMED LAKES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; WORD-CLOUD; CATASTROPHIC DRAINAGE; CORDILLERA BLANCA; IMPACT; INVENTORY; HAZARD; SCIENCE	Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are among the most concerning consequences of retreating glaciers in mountain ranges worldwide. GLOFs have attracted significant attention amongst scientists and practitioners in the past 2 decades, with particular interest in the physical drivers and mechanisms of GLOF hazard and in socioeconomic and other human-related developments that affect vulnerabilities to GLOF events. This increased research focus on GLOFs is reflected in the gradually increasing number of papers published annually. This study offers an overview of recent GLOF research by analysing 594 peer-reviewed GLOF studies published between 2017 and 2021 (Web of Science and Scopus databases), reviewing the content and geographical focus as well as other characteristics of GLOF studies. This review is complemented with perspectives from the first GLOF conference (7-9 July 2021, online) where a global GLOF research community of major mountain regions gathered to discuss the current state of the art of integrated GLOF research. Therefore, representatives from 17 countries identified and elaborated trends and challenges and proposed possible ways forward to navigate future GLOF research, in four thematic areas: (i) understanding GLOFs - timing and processes; (ii) modelling GLOFs and GLOF process chains; (iii) GLOF risk management, prevention and warning; and (iv) human dimensions of GLOFs and GLOF attribution to climate change.

Wheat samples (N = 272) were analyzed for FDKs via visual estimation and manual weighing according to ISO 7970 and are statistically evaluated using SPSS. The dipole block in 2015 reduced the effects of environmental factors to non-significant correlations with FDKs, while the omega block in 2016 was non-significantly to very significantly correlated with FDKs in the northwestern and western regions. The occurrence of FDKs was favored for wheat cultivation in acidic soils and inhibited in alkaline soils. Wheat samples with FDKs >= 1% were sampled from crops grown in river meadows with high and very high risks of flooding. Knowing the contaminants' geographical and spatial distributions under the influence of regular and extreme weather events is important for establishing measures to mitigate the effects of climate change and to ensure human and animal health.

Additionally, 66% of the world's population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050, making flood prevention and risk reduction increasingly important. Sustainability, resilience and ecosystem services are essential to increase human well-being in urban environments. Nature-based Solutions (NBS) can provide all the benefits of urban green spaces combined with flood mitigation. This work aims to provide useful information to promote the adoption of NBS to build communities resilient to climate change by exploring how people's perception of and willingness to implement some NBS. To this end, an online survey was conducted to investigate the knowledge and the perception of NBS and grey infrastructures among people in Veneto, a north-Eastern region of Italy. Data analysis revealed a significant correlation between previous knowledge of water management systems and the perceived effectiveness of some NBS. Behaviors linked to the level of connection with the territory have also been found to influence the perceived effectiveness of NBS. This study provides insights into the dynamics behind the implementation of NBS to reduce the risk of urban flooding and can help policymakers adapt urban plans to promote the adoption of NBS.

Modelling analysis using MANTRA was performed to examine the sustainability of coastal groundwater and vegetation in Pantai Acheh in response to SLR. MANTRA was developed by linking two United States Geological Survey (USGS) simulation models known as MANHAM and SUTRA. Simulation analysis revealed that Penang Island does not have viable fresh groundwater. Further, a projected 1-m SLR may lead to a 22% loss in mangrove coverage within the study site, adversely impacting SDG2 and SDG6. Penang's current water management practices are not sustainable to meet growing demand for freshwater and to overcome the impacts of global climate change (GCC). Hence, alternative water supply options such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater exploitation and consumer education deserve careful consideration and research to ensure a sustainable water future for Penang Island towards achieving SDG6 and SDG2. Key elements for achieving these two SDGs include adapting integrated coastal zone management and integrated water management to mitigate increased risk of floods and droughts due to GCC and SLR, and protecting mangrove forests and their ecosystem services from further degradation.

A rapid increase in population size and widespread poverty in the area have led to an increase in pressure on the lagoon for ecosystem goods and services, and to unplanned alterations in the buffer zone surrounding the lagoon. Unsustainable resources use within the KVLS is also causing a reduction in quality and quantity of water in the KVLS affecting lagoon productivity, increased coastal flooding and increased sand dune erosion. In order to address this problem. Kune Vaini Lagoons System is vulnerable to the effects of climate change and is expected to experience more intense and frequent floods and storm surges [1]. This study was realised in the framework of ongoing project "Climate changes adaption interventions of the Kune-Vaini lagoon system (Lezha, Albania) - ecological approach". Field work was done from July 2018 to July 2019. with an interval of approximately of two month. Sampling took place in five station wich were selected to represent the water quality of Kune-Vaini lagoon system. This study aimed to evaluate seasonal variation of the TSI reported by Lamparelli, using specific TSI values of the total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a).

J	Ebi, KL; Hess, JJ				Ebi, Kristie L.; Hess, Jeremy J.			Health Risks Due To Climate Change: Inequity In Causes And Consequences	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Editorial Material							MANAGEMENT; EVENTS	Climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels, and it will continue to do so. Average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising. In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming.

An adaptive flood control operation model has been established and solved using genetic algorithm in order to ensure the safety of dam and downstream areas under precipitation extremes. In view of the precipitation events for the period 1951-2017, the monthly extreme precipitation events are expected to rise in the period 2020-2100 by 10.4%, 11.0%, and 11.4% at a 10-, 20-, and 50-year return period, respectively. After optimal regulation, the maximum release is reduced by 60.8%, 43.6%, and 42.7%, while the average reservoir water level is reduced by 0.13 m, 0.14 m, and 0.11 m in extreme flood events with a 10-, 20-, and 50-year return period, respectively. In conclusion, the adaptive flood control operation can ensure the safety of dam and downstream areas and mitigate possible impacts of extreme flood events under climate change.

An approach that values the public good of hazard mitigation provisioned by natural ecosystems could also incentivise government, beneficiaries and insurance companies to share responsibility and funding for targeted conservation and restoration. To illuminate this concept of the insurance value of ecosystems, it is important to map the relationship between the area(s) that benefit from and provide regulating ecosystem services and to identify what determines the level of protection. In the case of flood control regulation that benefits at-risk urban areas, upstream or inland peri-urban areas are key. We present steps to operationalise the insurance value in policy using spatial indicators of peri-urban biodiversity and vegetation and soil health for four Mexican cities. For Mexico City only, we identify at-risk areas and characterise upstream peri-urban areas and find this insurance value is already diminished. Combining spatial analysis with a damage cost function we estimate the expected damage costs of different flood events and the monetary value of enhancing this insurance value. This estimate could be compared to other policy interventions and integrated into hazard insurance.

Similarly to other natural phenomena, the interactions between flow, sediment and vegetation uprooting is governed by both the magnitude and duration of hydrological events. In this work, we analytically derive the link between probabilities of plant uprooting by flow and the return time of corresponding hydrologic erosion events. This physically-based analysis allows to define the key parameters involved in the plant uprooting dynamics, and to link the uprooting probability of riparian vegetation to plant biomechanical characteristics, hydrological regime and sediment parameters. For example, we show how the rooting depth changes the return time of critical hydrologic event uprooting plants with different probabilities. The model also shows the difference between magnitude driven and duration driven flow uprooting events.The proposed approach is eventually validated against data from field measurements and numerical simulations of pioneer woody species for two flood events with different return period. Our approach demonstrates the strong interrelations between the hydrological river regime and vegetation properties and suggests that such interactions may be key for species recruitment and consequent ecosystem shifts when hydrological regime is altered by either human or climate changing scenarios.

Enhanced flood risk with 1.5 °C global warming in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						flooding; climate change; Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna; 1.5 degrees C global warming	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; RIVER; PRECIPITATION; FLOWS; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS; EXTREMES; INDEXES	Flood hazard is a global problem, but regions such as south Asia, where people's livelihoods are highly dependent on water resources, can be affected disproportionally. The 2017 monsoon flooding in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin, with record river levels observed, resulted in similar to 1200 deaths, and dramatic loss of crops and infrastructure. The recent Paris Agreement called for research into impacts avoided by stabilizing climate at 1.5 degrees C over 2 degrees C global warming above pre-industrial conditions. Climate model scenarios representing these warming levels were combined with a high-resolution flood hazard model over the GBM region. The simulations of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming indicate an increase in extreme precipitation and corresponding flood hazard over the GBM basin compared to the current climate. So, for example, even with global warming limited to 1.5 degrees C, for extreme precipitation events such as the south Asian crisis in 2017 there is a detectable increase in the likelihood in flooding. The additional similar to 0.6 degrees C warming needed to take us from current climate to 1.5 degrees C highlights the changed flood risk even with low levels of warming.	[Uhe, P. F.; Mitchell, D.

A CGE Framework for Modeling the Economics of Flooding and Recovery in a Major Urban Area	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Coastal; economic impacts; flooding; modeling	GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM-ANALYSIS; INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUBSTITUTION ELASTICITIES; TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; NATURAL DISASTER; FRASER-RIVER; IMPACT; RISK; ADAPTATION	Coastal cities around the world have experienced large costs from major flooding events in recent years. Climate change is predicted to bring an increased likelihood of flooding due to sea level rise and more frequent severe storms. In order to plan future development and adaptation, cities must know the magnitude of losses associated with these events, and how they can be reduced. Often losses are calculated from insurance claims or surveying flood victims. However, this largely neglects the loss due to the disruption of economic activity. We use a forward-looking dynamic computable general equilibrium model to study how a local economy responds to a flood, focusing on the subsequent recovery/reconstruction. Initial damage is modeled as a shock to the capital stock and recovery requires rebuilding that stock. We apply the model to Vancouver, British Columbia by considering a flood scenario causing total capital damage of $14.6 billion spread across five municipalities. GDP loss relative to a no-flood scenario is relatively long-lasting. It is 2.0% ($2.2 billion) in the first year after the flood, 1.7% ($1.9 billion) in the second year, and 1.2% ($1.4 billion) in the fifth year.

J	Saad, M; Kamel, M; Moftah, H				Saad, M.; Kamel, Mostafa; Moftah, Hussein			Landslide susceptibility mapping for the Red Sea Mountains: A multi-criteria decision analysis approach	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						LSM; RSM; MCDA; AHP; IV; Landslide inventory map	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; INFORMATION VALUE; PROCESS AHP; GIS; DISTRICT; MAPS	The Earth's climate system is clearly warming. Unquestionably, climate change has an impact on landslides by affecting the stability of both naturally occurring and artificially constructed slopes. Less certain are the type, extent, degree, and direction of the changes in stability conditions as well as the location, abundance, activity, and frequency of landslides in response to the expected climate changes. Climate change threatens global eco-systems, causing severe human and economic losses through sea level rise, hurricanes, flooding, landslides, and heat waves. Landslides in high mountains could become more common as a result of these changes. The high -speed electric train project in Egypt seeks to provide sustainable transportation, lessen climate change, and enhance public health. The study area was conducted along a 70-km track in the Eastern Desert, Egypt, across steep and rugged basement rocks of the Red Sea mountain chain (RSM). The geographic pinpointing of landslide susceptibility zones plays a significant role in promoting hazards mitigation in mountainous areas, such as RSM. The aim of this research project is to create a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) utilizing multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the region using information value (IV) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approaches that encompass the third proposed track of the high-speed electric railroad Qena-Hurghada between the RSM. The landslide inventory map, which has a total of 12 single landslide locations, was created based on fieldwork using hand-held GPS and Landsat 8 images. The two decision-making techniques were used to contrast the LSM factors based on the knowledge of experts using the qualitative method of AHP with the statistical approach that depends on the field data IV. Ten landslide-influencing parameters taken into consideration are slope, lithology, rainfall distribution, distance to fault, distance to track, seismicity of area, distance to epicenter, land cover, distance to stream, and aspect. The parameters were obtained using LANDSAT8 and SRTM DEM of a 30 m resolution, vectorized lithological structure units from a 1:2000, 000 map, and data between (1913-2000) for yearly precipitation and (1997-2018) for seismic activity of the research area. A GIS-based method produces a themed layer map for each geoenvironmental element, weighing each parameter after examination. A LSM was produced using a combination of thematic layers that were then separated into four grades: low, moderate, high, and very high, based on the intensity of the landslide vulnerability. According to AUC data, the IV model has a better success rate 0.85 than the AHP model 0.82. The study's models, especially when applied to the IV method, showed good accuracy in forecasting landslide vulnerability. The method shows rising landslide percentages with susceptibility and delivers accurate results that are compatible with the landslide inventory map. Environmental decisions often lead to unintended consequences due to lost information, incorrect factor selection, limited expert expertise, and ignoring uncertainty. This investigation emphasizes the importance of LSM as a tool for decision-makers to minimize landslide losses and damage.

Natural factors and human disturbance are the main drivers of changes in channel morphology thatmodify natural sediment and flow regimes at local, catchment, and regionalscales. In glaciated catchments, river sediment loads are likely to increase due to increasing snowmelt and glacier melt runoff, facilitated by climate change. Additionally, channel erosion and depositional dynamics andpatterns are influenced by sediment delivery from hillslopes and sedimentin the forefields of retreating glaciers. In order to reliably assess themagnitudes of the channel-changing processes and their frequencies due torecent climate change, the investigation period needs to be extended to thelast century, ideally back to the end of the Little Ice Age. Moreover, ahigh temporal resolution is required to account for the history of changesin channel morphology and for better detection and interpretation of relatedprocesses. The increasing availability of digitised historical aerial imagesand advancements in digital photogrammetry provide the basis forreconstructing and assessing the long-term evolution of the surface, interms of both planimetric mapping and the generation of historical digitalelevation models (DEMs). The main issue of current studies is the lack of information over a longerperiod. Therefore, this study contributes to research on fluvial sedimentchanges by estimating the sediment balance of a main Alpine river (Fagge) in a glaciated catchment (Kaunertal, Austria) over 19 surveyperiods from 1953 to 2019. Exploiting the potential of historicalmulti-temporal DEMs combined with recent topographic data, we quantify 66 years of geomorphic change within the active floodplain, including erosion,deposition, and the amounts of mobilised sediment. Our study focuses on aproglacial river that is undergoing a transition phase, resulting from anextensive glacier retreat of approximately 1.8 km. This has led to the formation of new channel networks and an overall negative cumulativesediment balance for the entire study area. We found that high-magnitudemeteorological and hydrological events associated with local glacierretreats have a significant impact on the sediment balance. The gauge recordindicates an increase in such events, as well as in runoff and probably insediment transport capacity. Despite this, the sediment supply has declinedin the last decade, which can be attributed to a lower contribution of thelateral moraines coupled to the channel network and less sediment sourcedfrom the melting Gepatsch Glacier as evidenced by roches moutonneesexposed in the current/most recent forefield.

While their potential existence is recognized, a systematic method for policy-relevant research on SETPs is lacking. This study introduces a stepwise approach for identification of SETPs that supports decision making under uncertain climate and socio-economic conditions. The approach is demonstrated with a stylized case study on the collapse of house prices (a SETP) in a coastal city, due to increasing flood risk from sea level rise. We explore four dynamic adaptive management strategies under a wide range of possible futures. We find that under scenarios with very high and rapid sea level rise, tipping points in real estate prices occur if the market responds to sudden changes in perceived flood risk rather than gradually adjusting prices to changes in flood risk in a rational manner. Such SETPs can only be avoided with a proactive strategy and when flood protection measures are implemented rapidly. Our approach can guide future studies on SETPs and seeks to move the study of SETPs towards a concept that provides perspective of action for policy makers.	[van Ginkel, Kees C.

Such extreme climate events may have long-lasting impact on more sessile organisms, such as unionid freshwater mussels, which are highly imperiled. The objective of our study was to test specific predictions for the impact of an extreme drought in 2011/2012, extreme flooding in 2017, and long-term changes by comparing recent and historical mussel community data from an understudied yet biodiverse region of Texas, USA. Drought had the most detrimental impact leading to community-wide declines, indicated by a significant decline of abundances, species richness and occupied sites. Flooding led to shifts in community composition and spatial distribution. Both severe declines and a distinct community shift occurred over the long-term, where the dominance of species shifted to those more tolerable of disturbance. Saltwater intrusion likely caused a significant increase post-flood of a species known to be tolerant of brackish water (Glebula rotundata). The impact of flooding was likely buffered by connectivity with extensive backwater areas, forming large wetlands, which may act as crucial refuges for mussels during extreme climatic events. Thus, protecting wetlands is crucial to protect freshwater mussels and the ecosystem services they provide.

Multitemporal mapping of glacier lakes through optical satellite remote-sensing imageries can only provide us comparative analysis of glacier lake changes during long time intervals. In recent years, the rapid development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has made it possible to observe seasonal changes of glacial lakes. This letter proposed a polarization enhancement-based maximum interclass variance (PE-MIV) method to accurately and automatically mapping the seasonal cycles of glacial lakes based on multipolarization SAR data. Taking the Gongcuo and Langcuo glacial lakes in Laigu village, Tibetan Plateau, as examples, based on 113 Sentinel-1 SAR imageries covering 2017 to 2020 with a 12-day revisiting time, the seasonal boundary changes of both lakes were extracted automatically with a relative accuracy of 93.59%. The seasonal variations of glacial lake area are closely related to temperature and precipitation. This letter demonstrated that the satellite SAR (short revisiting time, multipolarization, etc.) is an effective tool to monitor areal changes of glacier lakes, which can be widely applied in detecting glacier lakes, GLOFs, and their response to climate change.

We tested the hypothesis that drought events affect plant community composition and structure at a small-scale within a riparian fragment towards a reduction in floristic-structural complexity. The tree community was sampled in three habitats (wet, transitional and dry) and monitored in seven inventories carried out between 1991 and 2018. Hydrological variations were evaluated through annual rainfalls, river flow rates and water level data. The species richness and the detrended correspondence analysis axes were used to characterise the temporal modifications in floristic composition. Community structure was described in terms of biomass: accumulated, growth of survivors, mortality and recruitment. Generalised linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the effects of time and environment in community. It was concluded that the climate has become drier in recent years due to declining precipitation that has affected flow rates and water levels. The floristic-structural complexity of the study fragment was maintained during the monitoring period. However, prolonged and extreme drought events displayed the potential to impact floristic-structural patterns.

In response, Thai leaders primarily blamed the external forces of nature and climate change. Depoliticising disasters and absolving national leaders of responsibility, these discourses about nature and climate change as the main cause of flooding led policymakers to primarily build infrastructure to block and drain water. We argue that the location and patterns of flood protection infrastructure reflect flows of power and the circulation of capital. We build upon Graham and Marvin's notion of 'splintering urbanism' to develop the concept of 'splintering disaster'. We do so to make sense of the spatially dispersed, but ideologically unified strategy of flood protection adopted in Bangkok. We argue that the splintered nature of flood infrastructures demonstrates the varied and complex factors that produce new regimes of urban water control in the wake of disasters. As we demonstrate, flood mitigation projects do not foreclose future floodwater, but instead, redistribute nature, risk and injury. The city both shapes and is shaped by this spatially fragmented response to water. We aim to use this concept to develop a conceptual vocabulary for understanding post-disaster infrastrudural politics.

Here, we demonstrate based on the most comprehensive flood database to date, that climate variations dominate the spatial pattern of changes in annual flood peak discharge in China, despite intense human alterations of the river and land systems over the past four decades. Regional flood increases are mainly associated with increasing precipitation due to changes in the East Asian Summer Monsoon, tropical cyclones and the subtropical westerly jet. Regional flood decreases are due to decreased soil moisture in the North China plain. Our results highlight the need for flood management policies to go beyond local measures and adapt to the effects of climate change. Plain Language Summary Changes in river floods are of worldwide concern due to their massive socio-economic impacts. Understanding the reasons of changes in this hazard is a prerequisite for managing the associated risks efficiently. Potential reasons include climate change, river regulations and changing land management practices. In some countries, such as China, the recent rapid socio-economic development has led to dramatic modifications of the river and land system. Existing studies suggest that flood changes in China are mainly a result of land use change and the construction of reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate based on the most comprehensive flood database to date, that climate variations dominate the spatial pattern of changes in annual flood peak discharge in China, despite the intense human alterations over the past four decades. Flood trends of human-modified and neighboring near-natural watersheds are generally similar. Regional flood increases are mainly associated with increasing precipitation due to changes in the East Asian Summer Monsoon, tropical cyclones and the subtropical westerly jet.

While risk and vulnerability are typically assessed using historical information, possible future climates now also need to be considered, using quantitative climate datasets whenever possible. The current challenge is the range of availability, and levels of uncertainty, for specific parameters which are important to ports and to inland waterways. When quantitative information is available, a scenario-based approach can be used to identify an appropriate range of projections for assessing risks and designing structures. Notwithstanding the availability of quantitative data, however, adaptive solutions should be favoured. This is especially important where residual uncertainty is high and/or where significant or complex investments are involved. The development of adaptation pathways enables the implementation of phased responses as climate-related hazards such as pluvial flooding or sea level rise evolve. The adaptation pathway approach also reduces the risk of maladaptation associated with the assumption of a deterministic future condition for the asset or operation's design life.

The term refers to techniques inspired, supported and copied from nature, avoiding large constructions and other harmful interventions. In this work the development and evaluation of an NBS applied to the Spercheios river basin in Central Greece is presented. The river is susceptible to heavy rainfall and bank overflow, therefore the intervention selected is a natural water retention measure that aims to moderate the impact of flooding and drought in the area. After the deployment of the NBS, we examine the benefits under current and future climate conditions, using various climate change scenarios. Even though the NBS deployed is small compared to the rest of the river, its presence leads to a decrease in the maximum depth of flooding, maximum velocity and smaller flooded areas. Regarding the subsurface/groundwater storage under current and future climate change and weather conditions, the NBS construction seems to favor long-term groundwater recharge.

Despite this proliferation of research, a systematic understanding of how these studies are theoretically grounded is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed 4432 articles that address SVRA in various disciplinary fields (e.g. psychology, sociology, geography, mathematics) for various hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides, storm surges, wildfires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcano eruptions. We focus on the extent to which these studies explicate the frameworks, theoretical constructs or theories they rely on. Surprisingly, we found that about 90% of the reviewed studies do not explicitly refer to a theoretical un-derpinning. Overall, theories focusing on individuals' SVRA were more frequently used than those focusing on systems, society, groups, and networks. Moreover, the uptake of theories varied according to the hazard investigated and field of knowledge, being more frequent in wildfire and flood studies and articles published in social science journals. Based on our analysis, we propose a reflexive handling of theories to foster more transparent, comparable, and robust empirical research on SVRA.

Climate change risk to global port operations	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; STABILITY; LOSSES; CITIES; CMIP5	The ports sector is critical to global transport and trade. Climate change may compromise port operations, resulting in an increase in operational shutdowns and subsequent economic losses. Here, we present an analysis of historical global risk across the operations of 2,013 ports worldwide and the impacts under a high-end warming scenario, considering atmospheric and marine hazards, industry established operational thresholds, exposure and vulnerability. Increased coastal flooding and overtopping due to sea level rise, as well as the heat stress impacts of higher temperatures, are the main contributors to amplified risk. Ports located in the Pacific Islands, Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean appear to be at extremely high risk by 2100, whereas those in the African Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula (Persian Gulf and Red Sea) are expected to experience very high risk. Estimating risks at the global scale cannot capture site-level details, but these results provide a benchmark for further research and decision-making. Global trade and transport depend on the resilience of the ports sector. Multi-hazard operational risks are estimated for 2,013 ports under historical climate and future warming; of the marine and atmospheric hazards considered, coastal flooding, wave overtopping and heat stress increase risk most.

The framework systematically assembles the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods and the Vulnerability Assessment frameworks to develop its structural and analytical components. The resulting five-step approach involves: (i) identification of context along with understanding what aspect of vulnerability need to be studied; (ii) assessment of livelihood exposure to climate impacts involving both community perspectives and meteorological data-based climate forecasts; (iii) characterization of available capital asset usages to help buffer climate sensitivity; (iv) analysis of formal and informal institutional impetus to enhance adaptive capacity; and (v) evaluation of gaps between context-specific vulnerability and institutional and policy responses to avoid maladaptive trajectories. Drawing on published research and policy documentation, we apply the framework to the livelihood systems operating in the northeastern floodplain community of Bangladesh to demonstrate the utility of the approach and then discuss its potential to inform adaptation strategies.

The Sikkim and the Eastern Himalaya are a canvas of vivid landscapes and of different climate zones. The study of cryosphere needs more attention on long term climatic trends of surface air temperature. The Gurudongmar area is very much important because this area is surrounded by glaciers and as well as cold desert and TsoLhamo Lake nearby. The Gurudongmar lake (located at an altitude of 17,800 ft) has been studied by several researchers in the context of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and reported a high risk lake which is being largely affected by global warming and climate change. The present study is aimed to investigate the trend of temperature in recent past and in future time periods over the study area of Sikkim. The observed and model's simulated gridded temperature data is considered to inkling of rising trend in winter months of December-January-February (DJF) over the study area. An increase in temperature is found for the future time period. This can be linked to the increasing hazard risk and change in local cryosphere environment.	[Barat, Archisman; Sarthi, P.

This is the first study on this topic to also include quantification of natural climate variability, which is the dominant uncertainty for precipitation at local scales with large implications for runoff projections, for example. To quantify natural climate variability, a weather generator was applied to simulate inherently consistent climate variables for multiple realizations of current and future climates at 100 m spatial and hourly temporal resolution over a 12 x 12 km high-altitude study area in the Swiss Alps. The output of the weather generator was used as input for subsequent simulations with an energy balance snow model. The climate change signal for snow water resources stands out as early as mid-century from the noise originating from the three sources of uncertainty investigated, namely uncertainty in emission scenarios, uncertainty in climate models, and natural climate variability. For ROS events, a climate change signal toward more frequent and intense events was found for an RCP 8.5 scenario at high elevations at the end of the century, consistently with other studies. However, for ROS events with a substantial contribution of snowmelt to runoff (> 20 %), the climate change signal was largely masked by sources of uncertainty. Only those ROS events where snowmelt does not play an important role during the event will occur considerably more frequently in the future, while ROS events with substantial snowmelt contribution will mainly occur earlier in the year but not more frequently. There are two reasons for this: first, although it will rain more frequently in midwinter, the snowpack will typically still be too cold and dry and thus cannot contribute significantly to runoff; second, the very rapid decline in snowpack toward early summer, when conditions typically prevail for substantial contributions from snowmelt, will result in a large decrease in ROS events at that time of the year. Finally, natural climate variability is the primary source of uncertainty in projections of ROS metrics until the end of the century, contributing more than 70 % of the total uncertainty. These results imply that both the inclusion of natural climate variability and the use of a snow model, which includes a physically based process representation of water retention, are important for ROS projections at the local scale.

J	Dhanalakshmi, S; Kankara, RS				Dhanalakshmi, Silamban; Kankara, Roop Singh			Assessment on Shoreline Retreat in Response to Sea Level Rise - Chennai Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Ocean-Society-of-India Conference (OSICON)	AUG 28-30, 2017	Thiruvananthapuram, INDIA	Ocean Soc India, NCESS, Natl Ctr Coastal Res		Sea level rise; shoreline change analysis; inundation; GIS	INDIAN-OCEAN; TSUNAMI	In the present condition, the rise in sea level due to climate change is a serious threat for the environment. Global average sea levels are predicted as 1.8 mm/y during 1870-2009 and nearly 2.8 mm/y along the Indian Coast by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC). Impacts of rise in sea-level will be the loss of land in coastal areas through erosion, submergence of the coastal landscape and the threat of inundation. Shore erosion causes the shoreline to retreat and this leads to affecting the erosion zone by moving the shoreline inland. In this study, the attempt is made to demarcate the impact of sea level rise along the Chennai coast (Tamil Nadu) located along the southeast coast of India. This area experiences threat from many disasters such as storm, cyclone, flood, tsunami and long-term sea level rise. The shoreline has been extracted and using DSAS tool in ArcGIS, long-term (1990-2012, 1990-2013, 1990-2014, 1990-2015 and 1990-2016) were analyzed using Linear regression Rate and Weighted Linear Regression. 36.7% of the coast was seen with eroding condition. Overall long-term analysis trend suggest that more than 60% of the region falls in stable to low accretion. Projection of climate change-induced SLR at different RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5) of IPCC AR5 on different time scale (2025, 2050, 2075, 2100) for the coasts of Chennai. The values range from 7.1 cm to 36.87 cm for RCP 2.6; 7.37 cm to 49.84 cm for RCP 4.5; 7.16 cm to 51.75 cm for RCP 6; 7.38 cm to 77.88 cm for RCP 8.5. Shoreline retreat to an increase in local sea level was mapped using the Bruun Rule. Since the Bruun Rule (BR) has some limitations, the modified Bruun rule was used to analyze the inundation factor. The area of horizontal inundation is estimated as similar to 1.6 km (Braun rule) and similar to 1.1 km (Modified Bruun Rule). The required data was processed using GIS environment. Since we adhere to the fact that the coastal change is not a periodical accumulation per year, but that it entraps a value of future crisis assessment and gives a literal warning about the shore to be persevered.

Physical dynamics of Lake Victoria over the past 34 years (1984-2018): Is the lake dying?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lake Victoria; Physical parameters; Spatio-temporal changes; Climate change; Anthropogenic activities	EAST-AFRICAN RAINFALL; TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; NILE BASIN; PRECIPITATION; LANDSAT; ACCURACY	Understanding changes in the physical dynamics of lakes (e.g., areas and shorelines) is important to inform policies, planning and management during climate extremes (e.g., floods and droughts). For Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, its physical dynamics and associated changes are not well understood as evidenced, e.g., from the citations of its area 66,400-69,485 km(2), length 300-412 km, width 240-355 km, and shorelines 3300-4828 km. Its sheer size and lack of research resources commitment by regional governments hamper observations. This contribution employs a suite of remotely sensed products for the past 34 years (1984-2018); Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Google Earth Pro, CHIRPS, Multivariate El' Nino-Southern Oscillation Index and altimetry data together with the physical parameters from 37 publications (1969-2018) to (i) study the lake's dynamics and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse hotspots where significantly dynamic changes occur, and (iii), study the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these dynamics. Utilizing manual digitisation, MNDWI, NDVI and PCA methods, the study shows the lake's mean surface area to be 69,295 km2 (i.e., 812 km(2) or 1.2% more than that of the 37 publications) and its 2018 value to be 69,216 km2 (i.e., similar to 733 km(2) (1.1%) more than that of the 37 publications). As to whether the lake is dying, it shrunk by 203 km(2) (0.3%) compared to its 1984 value, a decrease noted mainly in four hotspot Gulfs (Birinzi 40%, Winam 20%, Emin Pasha 38% and Mwanza 55%). Correspondingly, the expansion of Nalubaale Dam (2002-2006) decreased the areas by 31%, 10%, 21% and 44%, respectively. Seasonal analysis shows an increase of 9 km(2) in the lake's area during the heavy rainy season (March-May) while the ENSO enlarged the area by 0.23% (2007) and 0.45% (2010). It is evident, therefore, that both climate variability/change and anthropogenic activities are exerting a toll on the tropical's largest freshwater body thereby necessitating careful exploitation and management plans.

The Tunisian Mediterranean coast is a region that is prone to experiencing severe weather. The flood events have a significant impact on the infrastructure and populations residing in coastal lowlands. Studies on lagoon sediments have recently revealed important information about the past extreme hydrological events as well as their relationship with past climate changes. This study aims to reconstruct the historical extreme flood-event record using sediment cores taken from the El Bibane coastal lagoon, southeast of Tunisia. Three sediment cores BL12-5, BL12-7 and BL12-10 were studied. Through a combination of analytical techniques such as the chronological, geochemical and sedimentological analyses, past flash floods were identified. Results display that the sedimentological signature of the paleoflood levels recognized within the lagoonal sequence is characterized by high values of the elemental ratios (Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca) and high content of fine material such as clay and silt. These floods are thought to have occurred as a result of intense precipitation that increased the terrigenous input to the El Bibane lagoon by the Fessi River. Chronologies of 210Pb, 137Cs, and 14C have been used to calculate the age of these floods. The records offer a good temporal correlation with historical floods recorded in the central Mediterranean region. In the southeast of Tunisia, periods with more frequent floods coincide with periods generally under alternation of wetter and drier conditions and minima of solar activity. The paleoflood record of the El Bibane lagoon can help researchers better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for changes in the intensity and/or frequency of extreme events in the south of Tunisia. Our research proves that the proxies utilized here have a lot of potential for reconstructing past floods, which is important knowledge for future flood prediction and mitigation in southeast Tunisia.

J	Huang, ZJ; Xu, JH; Zheng, LL				Huang, Zijin; Xu, Jianhua; Zheng, Lilin			Long-Term Change of Lake Water Storage and Its Response to Climate Change for Typical Lakes in Arid Xinjiang, China	WATER			English	Article						Xinjiang; satellite altimetry; water level; empirical model; lake water storage	TIBETAN PLATEAU; RIVER-BASINS; AREA; DYNAMICS; REGION; LEVEL	Lakes play a role as the sentinel of climate change. Surrounded by vast expanses of barren land with limited infrastructure, there is also a lack of knowledge about the dynamics of dryland lakes. The change of lake area can be effectively monitored by remote sensing, and multi-source satellite altimetry datasets provide the possibility to obtain long-term lake water level data. Using the Global Surface Water Monthly Historical dataset and altimetry water level dataset (Hydroweb), we reconstructed a time series of lake water storage changes in Xinjiang, Northwestern China, by establishing the empirical models based on the statistical relationship between the surface area and water level of each lake. We further explored lake response to climate change. The results show that the storage of water at Ayakkum Lake, Aqqikkol Lake and Aksayquin Lake have been undergoing an obvious expanding trend from 2000 to 2020, at a rate of 3.59x10(8)m(3)/a, 9.43x10(8)m(3)/a and 0.44x10(8)m(3)/a, respectively. In the plain and transition zone, Ulungur Lake showed an upward tendency (0.413x10(8)m(3)/a) in water storage, while Manas Lake and Bosten Lake experienced shrinkage with descending rates of -0.1x10(8)m(3)/a and -0.86x10(8)m(3)/a. Temperature changes significantly affect the lake water storage on plateaus, especially those lakes supplied with a large proportion of glacial meltwater. Precipitation is a key factor for changes of lake storage in the plain and transition zones. Meanwhile, extreme weather and man-made factors also play crucial roles. To reduce the risk of flood and drought disasters, rational regulation of water resources is required, and a large-scale integrated catchment management plan can avoid inadvertent trade-offs. This research provides a new perspective for lake water storage inversion, as well as data support for water resources management in arid areas including Xinjiang.

Climate change-induced extreme rainfall is expected to increase flood intensity and frequency, causing severe flooding in the Kathmandu basin. The upper reaches of the Nakkhu River are susceptible to landslides and have been impacted by large-scale sand mining. We simulate potential erosion and deposition scenarios along a 14 km reach of the Nakkhu River using the landscape evolution model CAESAR-Lisflood with a 10 m digital elevation model, field-derived sediment grain size data, daily discharge records and flood forecast models. In a series of numerical experiments, we compare riverbed profiles, cross-sections, flood extent and flow depths for three scenarios (1.2-, 85- and 1000-year return period floods). For each scenario, the model is first run without sediment transport and then with sediment transport for three grain size distributions (GSDs) (observed average, finer and coarser). In all cases, the inclusion of sediment led to predicted floods of a larger extent than estimated without sediment. The sediment grain size distribution was found to have a significant influence on predicted river morphology and flood inundation, especially for lower magnitude, higher probability flood events. The results emphasise the importance of including sediment transport in hydrological models when predicting flood inundation in sediment-rich rivers such as those in and around the Himalaya. Including sediment transport in flood hazard modelling can result in a larger inundation area and greater flood hazard, in addition to a change in river morphology. For low-intensity, high-frequency flood events, flood inundation is highly sensitive to sediment grain size distribution, but the importance of accurately estimating grain size distribution becomes less significant for extreme, high-intensity flood events. image	[Thapa, Saraswati; Sinclair, Hugh D.; Mudd, Simon M.; Attal, Mikael] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Thapa, Saraswati; Ghimire, Bhola N.] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Pulchowk Campus, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Creed, Maggie J.] Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow, Scotland; [Borthwick, Alistair G.

However, runoff studies in the karst basin based on future scenario projections are still lacking. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework consisting of a future land use simulation model (FLUS), an automated statistical downscaling model (ASD), a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and a multi-point calibration strategy. This frameword was used to investigate runoff changes under future climate and land use changes in karst watersheds. The Chengbi River basin, a typical karst region in southwest China, was selected as the study area. The ASD method was developed for climate change projections based on the CanESM5 climate model. Future land use scenarios were projected using the FLUS model and historical land use data. Finally, the SWAT model was calibrated using a multi-site calibration strategy and was used to predict future runoff from 2025-2100. The results show that: (1) the developed SWAT model obtained a Nash efficiency coefficient of 0.83, which can adequately capture the spatial heterogeneity characteristics of karst hydro-climate; (2) land use changes significantly in all three future scenarios, with the main phenomena being the interconversion of farmland and grassland in SSPs1-2.6, the interconversion of grassland, farmland and artificial surfaces in SSPs2-4.5 and the interconversion of woodland, grassland and artificial surfaces in SSPs5-8.5; (3) the average annual temperature will show an upward trend in the future, and the average annual precipitation will increase by 11.53-14.43% and (4) the future annual runoff will show a significant upward trend, with monthly runoff mainly concentrated in July-September. The variability and uncertainty of future runoff during the main-flood period may increase compared to the historical situation. The findings will benefit future water resources management and water security in the karst basin.

Co-occurring wintertime flooding and extreme wind over Europe, from daily to seasonal timescales	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						Compound event; Wind gusts; Flooding; Extreme event; Insurance sector; Compound risk	UK; PRECIPITATION; WINDSTORM; RAINFALL; IMPACTS; LOSSES; MODEL; RISK	The risk posed by heavy rain and strong wind is now suspected to be exacerbated by the way they co-occur, yet this remains insufficiently understood to effectively plan and mitigate. This study systematically investigates the correlations between wintertime (Oct-Mar) extremes relating to wind and flooding at all timescales from daily to seasonal. Meteorological reanalysis and river flow datasets are used to explore the historical period, and climate projections at 12 km resolution are analysed to understand the possible effects of future climate change (2061-2080, RCP 8.5). A new flood severity index (FSI) is also developed to complement the existing storm severity index (SSI). Initially, Great Britain (GB) is taken as a comparatively simple yet informative study area, then analysis is extended to the full European domain.Aggregated across GB, wind gusts and precipitation correlate strongly (r -0.6-0.8) at timescales from daily to seasonal, but peak around 10 days. A later peak is seen when considering correlations between wind gusts and river flows (40-60 days). This time is likely needed for catchments' soils to saturate. A conceptual multi-temporal, multi-process model of GB wintertime flood-wind co-occurrence is proposed as a basis for future investigation. When historical analysis is extended across Europe we find the timescale of maximum correlation varies strongly between nations, likely as a result of different meteorological drivers.Impact focused correlation (FSI-SSI) is lower (r -0.2) but increases notably with climate change at timescales of -40 days (r -0.4). Tentatively, very severe episodes (i.e., both >99th percentile) appear heavily influenced by climate change, increasing roughly threefold by 2061-2080 (p < 0.05). The return period of such an event is 16 years historically (compared to 56 years if the two hazards were independent), reduces to 5 years in future. Such metrics provide actionable information for insurers and other stakeholders.	[Bloomfield, H. C.; James, R.; Bates, P.

It is of great significance to understand the spatial distribution and change characteristics of glacial lakes for exploring their response patterns to climate change and assessing the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility. Based on Gaofen-1/6 PMS, Sentinel-2A/2B MSI and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images from 2000 to 2020, we integrated geographic information technology and mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of glacial lakes in Nepal and their dynamic changes, and further discriminated and evaluated the GLOF susceptibility of glacial lakes. The results show that there were 2420 glacial lakes in Nepal in 2020, mainly distributed within the 4500 similar to 5500 m, with an area of 87.21 km(2) and a water storage of 1921.72 x 10(6) m(3). The number and area of glacial lakes with each area above 0.01 km(2) in Nepal showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, while 499 new glacial lakes were born, 139 lakes disappeared, the area and water storage increased by 19.46 km(2), 403.07 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. Glacial lakes at altitudes <3000 m were relatively stable, while the number and area of glacial lakes at altitudes within 4500-5500 m increased rapidly. We assessed the GLOF susceptibility of 40 moraine-dammed glacial lakes with an area above 0.2 km(2) in Nepal, and found that there were 8, 12, 14 and 6 glacial lakes with low, medium, high and very high susceptibility, respectively. Among glacial lakes with very high GLOF susceptibility, potential GLOF events of Tsho Rolpa glacial lake, Lower Barun glacial lake and glacial lake with code of GL87091E27797N will cause great harm to downstream regions. GLOFs in Nepal will be in an active status in the future, therefore, the dynamics of glacial lakes and their surroundings should be continuously monitored.

Developing countries, such as Pakistan, are facing severe food security issues, where most of the population still experiences poverty and hunger in their daily lives. Flood disasters ruin valuable land, cause agricultural production losses, and interrupt livelihood routines as expected household livelihood becomes more vulnerable. This research work focused on investigating the flood hazards vulnerability and risk of food security in the Bait community flood-prone areas of Punjab, Pakistan, with a broader aspect in contrast to previous research work. A constructed food security index composed of several IPCC and FAO factors with correlated dimensions of food security was used for the empirical estimation in this study. A composite food security index was developed through polychoric principal component analysis. To estimate the influence on the overall food security condition in the study area, a food security index was regressed on various independent variables. Estimates of the study indicated that three-fourths of household respondents in the study area are confronted with the issue of food security with changeable scale. Financing schemes, physical assets, and family type illustrated the positive influence on respondents' food security level, whereas respondents suffering property losses owing to floods had a negative influence. The study findings suggested integrated strategies must be adopted to effectively deal with issues of food security in the scenario of increasing severity of flood disasters. Policymakers and disaster-concerned institutions need to develop disaster risk mitigation strategies by constructing new water reserves and clearing river encroachments to deal with flood disasters. Agricultural research and development authorities need to provide climate friendly seed varieties and promote particular food crops for flood prone areas to ensure food security and reduce livelihood vulnerability, specifically for the flood-prone communities.

Thus, this study explores the potential response of the popularly used precipitation extreme indices to the global warming for near future (2011-2040), middle future (2041-2070) and far future (2071-2100) periods, based on the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) Africa experiment outputs over Ethiopia. The results show that the wet (dry) spells were projected to significantly decrease (increase) over most parts of Ethiopia, with relatively longer (shorter) dry (wet) spells projected over the northern parts of Ethiopia. Conversely, the projected changes in extreme precipitation amount above the 95th percentile showed a substantial increase over most parts of Ethiopia, with higher values projected to be in the southern region. The result implies that extreme and heavy precipitation events are likely to be more intense, and could amplify the probability of flood risks, particularly over the southern region. The total and extreme precipitations generally show a strong positive correlation, indicating the increase in extreme precipitation is responsible for the increase in total wet-day precipitation amount in Ethiopia. In general, climate change will have high negative impacts on the dynamics of precipitation patterns over Ethiopia, which could result in more long dry seasons and shorter rainy seasons over most parts of Ethiopia. Thus, the food and water security situation in the region is highly vulnerable due to the projected changes in the intensity and frequency of climate extremes (droughts and floods). However, the increase in precipitation extremes could have the potential to enhance the dry season agricultural productivity of most of the regions in Ethiopia using efficient irrigation systems through excess water harvesting in the rainy season. This can also reduce flood occurrences and hence economic damages. In general, it is of great importance to discuss the socio-economic impacts that could result if increasing precipitation extremes, as well as the increasing (decreasing) trend of maximum length of the dry (wet) spells, continue in the future.

Such conditions lead to stationary weather patterns, triggering heat waves and sometimes prolonged intense rainfall. These wave events, referred to as periods of Quasi-Resonant Amplification (QRA), are relatively rare though and hence provide only a few data points in the meteorological record to analyse. Here, we use atmospheric models coupled to boundary conditions that have evolved slowly (i.e., climate), to supplement measurements. Specifically we assess altered probabilities of resonant episodes by employing a unique massive ensemble of atmosphere-only climate simulations to populate statistical distributions of event occurrence. We focus on amplified waves during the two most extreme European heat waves on record, in years 2003 and 2015 (Russo et al., 2015). These years are compared with other modelled recent years (1987-2011), and critically against a modelled world without climate change. We find that there are differences in the statistical characteristics of wave event likelihood between years, suggesting a strong dependence on the known and prescribed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) patterns. The differences are larger than those projected to have occurred under climate change since the pre-industrial period. However, this feature of small differences since pre-industrial is based on single large ensembles, with members consisting of a range of estimates of SST adjustment from pre-industrial to present. Such SST changes are from projections by a set of coupled atmosphere-ocean (AOGCM) climate models. When instead an ensemble for pre-industrial estimates is subdivided into simulations according to which AOGCM the SST changes are based on, we find differences in QRA occurrence. These differences suggest that to reliably estimate changes to extremes associated with altered amplification of planetary waves, and under future raised greenhouse gas concentrations, likely requires reductions in any spread of future modelled SST patterns.

We employ explainable machine learning techniques to model and understand internal displacement flows and patterns from observational data alone. For this purpose, a large, harmonized, global database of disaster-induced movements in the presence of floods, storms, and landslides during 2016-2021 is presented. We account for environmental, societal, and economic factors to predict the number of displaced persons per event in the affected regions. Here we show that displacements can be primarily attributed to the combination of poor household conditions and intense precipitation, as revealed through the interpretation of the trained models using both Shapley values and causality-based methods. We hence provide empirical evidence that differential or uneven vulnerability exists and provide a means for its quantification, which could help advance evidence-based mitigation and adaptation planning efforts. Ronco and colleagues analyze disaster-induced movements in the presence of floods, storms, and landslides during 2016-2021, providing empirical evidence that differential vulnerability exists and quantifying its extent. They achieve this by employing explainable machine learning techniques to model and understand internal displacement flows and patterns from observational data.

As sea-level rise (SLR) accelerates due to climate change, its multidisciplinary field of science has similarly expanded, from 41 articles published in 1990 to 1475 articles published in 2021, and nearly 15,000 articles published in the Web of Science over this 32-year period. Here, big-data bibliometric techniques are adopted to systematically analyse this large literature set. Four main research clusters (themes) emerge: (I) geological dimensions and sea-level indicators, (II) impacts, risks, and adaptation, (III) physical components of sea-level change, and (IV) coastal ecosystems and habitats, with 16 associated sub-themes. This analysis provides insights into the evolution of research agendas, the challenges and opportunities for future assessments (e.g. next IPCC reports), and growing focus on adaptation. For example, the relative importance of sub-themes evolves consistently with a relative decline in pure science analysis towards solution-focused topics associated with SLR risks such as high-end rises, declining ecosystem services, flood hazards, and coastal erosion/squeeze.

In particular, substantial spatiotemporal variations in precipitation can occur in some mountainous areas, and thus it is very important to identify hydrological processes in watershed with high resolution. To analyze the problem above, the Mann-Kendall test, the moving T-test, Sen's slope estimator and Spearman rank correlation test combined with the spatial interpolation function of ArcGIS, are used to analyze and discuss the evolution of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of precipitation and Runoff in a typical small watershed of mountainous areas. The result is precipitation showed a downward trend from south to north and from high-altitude to low-altitude regions. And the difference mainly occurred in the western part of the basin. And the conclusions show the following: 1) An abrupt change in both precipitation and Runoff sequences occurred in 1991; 2) the extreme value of the precipitation trend shifted from the central region to the western region; 3) for the ratio of Runoff in the flood season to annual Runoff, the sequence showed a significant upward trend (95 % confidence level), indicating that the uneven distribution of Runoff has significantly increased since the 1960s.

Moreover, the risk of flooding is increasing owing to a hydrological cycle intensified by climate change and by the concentration of population in cities vulnerable to flooding. Although conventional river-engineering structures, including continuous levees, flood-control dams, and drainage pump stations, have been installed in many countries to prevent flood damage, these measures are vulnerable to the large-scale floods that exceed the design level of the flood-control infrastructure. In contrast, traditional strategies and flood-control technology that has been used since ancient times allow inundation and instead strive to minimize flood damage in floodplains. Nevertheless, the onslaught of modern river-engineering methods means that traditional flood-control systems have been rapidly disappearing, with the concomitant decrease in floodplain inundation frequency. This paper reviews the current knowledge about traditional flood-control systems that are sustainable and provide effective flood countermeasures against future uncertainties. Furthermore, we describe the problems and solutions associated with the integration of traditional flood-control systems and conventional river-engineering methods to decrease flood damage in floodplains.

Drawing on the emblematic case of the conversion of Thailand's Cobra Swamp into Suvarnabhumi International Airport we argue that there is a fundamental clash between the internal logic of capital accumulation and the ecology of water that occurs in places in which land is under water for much of the year. Counterintuitively investment in public infrastructure such as airports targets locations that are exposed to flood risks. While the literature on capital fixes tends to treat "land" writ large, this paper adds a dimension that has been overlooked in the theoretical work, by highlighting the significance of the ecology of the land in which such fixes occur as a means of understanding patterns of investment, land use change and vulnerability. Our analysis draws on three separate but related concepts of capital "fixes"-spatial, technological and high/low road fixes. We argue the importance of recognising the specific ecological characteristics of land that capital "fixes". This perspective has global significance in providing critical insight into the ways in which capital creates and accommodates the kinds of vulnerabilities and risks associated with climate change.

A point often neglected in the climate adaptation literature is that the physical sources of predictability differ between projects with long and short planning periods: While historical and paleo climate records emphasize low-frequency modes of variability, anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter their occurrence at longer time scales. In this paper we present a set of stylized experiments to assess the uncertainties and biases involved in estimating future climate risk over a finite future period, given a limited observational record. These experiments consider both quasi-periodic and secular change for the underlying risk, as well as statistical models for estimating this risk from an N-year historical record. The uncertainty of IPCC-like future scenarios is considered through an equivalent sample size N. The relative importance of estimating short- or long-term risk depends on the investment life M. Shorter design lives are preferred for situations where interannual to decadal variability can be successfully identified and predicted, highlighting the importance of sequential investment strategies for adaptation.

Yet, hydrological predictions are highly uncertain, while the frequency, severity and spatial distribution of extreme events are further complicated by the increasing impact of human activities on the water cycle. In this commentary, we argue that four main aspects characterizing the complexity of human-water systems should be explicitly addressed: feedbacks, scales, tradeoffs and inequalities. We propose the integration of multiple research methods as a way to cope with complexity and develop policy-relevant science. Plain Language Summary Several governments today claim to be following the science in addressing crises caused by the occurrence of extreme events, such as floods and droughts, or the emergence of global threats, such as climate change and COVID-19. In this commentary, we show that there are no universal answers to apparently simple questions such as: Do levees reduce flood risk? Do reservoirs alleviate droughts? We argue that the best science we have consists of a plurality of legitimate interpretations and a range of foresights, which can be enriched by integrating multiple disciplines and research methods.

J	Rizzo, A; Anfuso, G				Rizzo, Angela; Anfuso, Giorgio			Coastal Dynamic and Evolution: Case Studies from Different Sites around the World	WATER			English	Editorial Material						coastal dynamics; coastal landscapes; coastal evolution assessment	SEA-LEVEL RISE; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EROSION; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; AREAS; SOUTH	In recent decades, coastal areas have experienced a progressive increase in erosion and flooding processes as a consequence of the combined effect of natural factors and strong human pressures. These processes are particularly evident on low-lying areas and are expected to be exacerbated by the ongoing climate change, which will impact the littorals both in the short term, by affecting the duration and frequency of storms, and in the long term, by inducing variation in the sea-level position. In this context, this Special Issue is devoted to collecting geomorphological studies on coastal dynamic and evolution by means of multidisciplinary research methodologies and investigations, which represent a very useful set of information for supporting the integrated management of coastal zone.

Few studies have conducted spatial analyses on probability rainfall using up-to-date rainfall data, which is crucial to comprehend regional rainfall variations for effective flood management and hydraulic structure design. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of probability rainfall factors in South Korea using 61 rainfall stations and four rainfall periods (years) (recent-10, 2011-2020; recent-20, 2001-2020; recent-30, 1991-2020; recent-40, 1981-2020). We mapped probability rainfall information, including probability rainfall intensities (20, 30, and 40 mm/h), return periods (10, 20, 50, and 100 years), rainfall durations (1, 2, 6, and 24 h), and rainfall depth. Results revealed wide variations in the northern and southwest inland regions based on rainfall periods. Decadal annual rainfall analysis revealed that the north and southwest inland regions indicated lower recent decadal rainfall than that in previous decades, while decadal annual rainfall in the southeast inland region remained constant. The generated spatial and temporal distribution maps offer valuable insights for comprehending the variation in probability rainfall factors across different time periods in South Korea, with practical implications for the planning and design of hydraulic structures.

This work aims to develop the relationship between overtopping phenomena and their impact costs through an approach that considers wave runup, corresponding overtopping events, their flow volume and related flooding costs. Herewith, it is possible to evaluate the relationship between the structure construction and maintenance costs and the consequent costs due to overtopping and flooding damages, leading to the design of optimised coastal structures solutions. To apply the proposed approach, a real case study on the Portuguese northwest coast (Ovar municipality) was analysed, evaluating overtopping and flooding data recorded by the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA), allowing costs per unit flooded volume to be estimated. Then, future scenarios were predicted to assess the influence of climate change, discuss intervention scenarios and evaluate the uncertainty of economic parameters' evolution. The proposed methodological approach represents a step forward in the estimative of coastal overtopping and flooding impacts, leading to increasing the knowledge about flooding and overtopping costs and optimised mitigation measures in artificialised coastal areas, where coastal defence works (longitudinal revetments) are present. This approach fills a gap in knowledge regarding this type of forecast in a medium- to long-term perspective.

In this study, we present a comprehensive examination on the evolution of storm properties during two distinct rainy seasons in Changtan Reservoir Basin located on the southeastern coast of China. We compare the differences in storm duration, inter-storm period, the average storm intensity, and with-in storm pattern between the Meiyu flood season (MFS) and typhoon flood season (TFS). We also explore the future projections of these storm properties based on Coupled Model Inter comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) precipitation outputs. Our results indicate that precipitation storms in TFS exhibit shorter duration and higher average storm intensity than those of MFS, the flood risk in June is mainly due to accumulative precipitation (longer duration), while in July to September, is mainly due to the storms with high intensity. The projected precipitation shows uncertainties for different emission scenarios, especially during TFS. However, the increasing trend of the average storm intensity is relatively consistent, which is supposed to bring more pressure on flood control in the study area. The results can provide a beneficial reference to water resources management.

Based on hydrometeorological data and glacier inventory data, the Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) model was used to simulate the changes of hydrologic processes in the Upper Shule River (USR) from 1971 to 2020, and variations of runoff and runoff components were quantitatively analyzed using the simulations and observations. The results showed that the glacier area has decreased by 21.8% with a reduction rate of 2.06 km(2)/a. Significant increasing trends in rainfall runoff, glacier runoff (GR) and baseflow indicate there has been a consistent increase in total runoff due to increasing rainfall and glacier melting. The baseflow has made the largest contribution to total runoff, followed by GR, rainfall runoff and snow runoff, with mean annual contributions of 38%, 28%, 18% and 16%, respectively. The annual contribution of glacier and snow runoff to the total runoff shows a decreasing trend with decreasing glacier area and increasing temperature. Any increase of total runoff in the future will depend on an increase of rainfall, which will exacerbate the impact of drought and flood disasters.

In such events, quality of life is compromised due to environmental changes and widespread of pathogens. Unfortunately, scientific knowledge on bacteria behavior during different hydrological events is still scarce, and such knowledge is essential for the decision-making process regarding flood prevention and mitigation measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the changes in the enterobacteriaceae community and toxicity from river water samples collected during hydrological cycles over the rainy and dry seasons and on flood events. Additionally, a principal component analysis was performed to verify the relation between microbial and chemical profiles and the hydrological events. Results showed the presence of 153 enterobacteriaceae from 32 different species and of toxic substances on water samples collected during all hydrological events. During the rainy period, the Escherichia coli concentration increased along the river, and during flood events, the diversity of bacteria increased. However, bacterial diversity was not statistically associated with a specific hydrological event. These events can happen all around the world, and due to climatic changes associated with overpopulated unplanned areas, new flood-prone areas can appear rapidly, favoring the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks.

Short-term recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following a flash flood in an urban river: a case study of the Palmiet River in Durban, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; habitat quality; macroinvertebrate recovery; taxa abundance	CATASTROPHIC FLOOD; RESILIENCE	Extreme floods have become frequent in the urban Palmiet River due to exacerbating climate change. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore a short-term recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following a flash flood in the Palmiet River, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Different biotopes, i.e. stones, gravel sand and mud, and vegetation were sampled after the March-April heavy rain in 2018. Ephemeroptera, Odonatan, and Hemipteran have shown similar trends across weeks at all sites. Plecoptera and Coleoptera started recovering at week four However, the total abundance and taxa richness had significantly recovered during the fourth week at site 2 and 3. and fifth week at site 1. Communities have shown no significant difference for each site from weeks six to eight (ANOVA, p > 0.5), which implies that climax on macroinvertebrate communities was reached at week six. Hydrologic regime change has not influenced water quality parameters across all weeks (ANOVA, p > 0.5) and this was also reflected on the average score per taxon (ASPT), which has shown no significant difference (ANOVA, p > 0.5) across weeks at all sites. These findings provide a baseline for future studies on flood effect on urban streams and supplement the understanding of the effects of sudden hydrologic regime changes on macroinvertebrate communities.

It is based on up to 220 stations with monthly precipitation time series that have a varying data availability within the study period. The stations are classified into eight regions with similar climate characteristics. Dry and wet periods are analyzed using the decile method as well as the modified Rainfall Anomaly Index mRAI at the 3-month timescale. Spatial extent, duration, and frequency of dry and wet periods show a large multi-decadal variability resulting in comparatively small long-term trends over the entirety of Europe for the study periods 1901-2015 and 1951-2015. Nonetheless, several sub-regions show distinct changes-with opposite signals for northern and southern Europe. Spatial extent and duration of dry periods generally decreased, while wet periods show increases throughout the 20th century-particularly in Scandinavia. A simultaneous increase in the frequency of severely dry and wet years, respectively, is observed since the 1980s. This indicates that temperature increases across Europe may be connected with an increasing frequency of extremes at both sides of the probability density function of precipitation.

This research analyses the extreme precipitation events (>= 100 mm/day) recorded in 26 observatories in the province of Alicante between 1981-2020. For this purpose, the observatories of the National Climatological Data Bank (BNDC) of the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), which contain less than 5 % of missing data for that period, have been selected. Prior to the analysis, a quality control of the database was carried out by calculating the Real Precision Index (RPI). The analysis of precipitation extremes was performed using Rstudio software. The results show the variability and spatial distribution of the events, as well as their evolution on the time scale, but it cannot be affirmed that there is a clear trend towards an increase in these events, since the evolution does not present statistical significance.

However, hydrological conditions may not change abruptly at a certain time, but rather evolve gradually over a period. We propose a trend-based time-varying approach that does not require these prerequisites to assess the climate- and human-induced impacts on hydrological conditions in the Pearl River Basin (PRB), China, which can be applied in other basins. The trend-based time-varying approach detects human activities exert a significant seasonal regulation on streamflow (i.e. 113% of the decreases in the wet season and 93% of the increases in the dry season) and 101% of the reductions in flood peaks in the East River Basin, the sub-basin with the highest ratio of total reservoir storage capacity to river discharge in the PRB. Climate change contributes to 77% of the increases in flood peaks in the West River Basin, a large sub-basin with lower flood control levels.

It is shown that the spatial correlation of the spring flood runoff layers, winter and summer-autumn low runoff, as well as snow storage have changed significantly. The chaotic pattern of the spatial correlation was gained, as a result of which the fields of the studied runoff characteristics became heterogeneous and anisotropic.	[Bolgov, M., V; Korobkina, E.

J	Ayalew, AT				Ayalew, Abebe Temesgen			The Synergic Effects of Climate Variability on Rainfall Distribution over Hare Catchment of Ethiopia	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY			English	Article							IMPACT; TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT; BASIN; WATER	Climate analysis at relevant time scales is important for water resources management, agricultural planning, flood risk assessment, ecological modeling, and climate change adaptation. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variability of climate on rainfall distribution for the Hare catchment of Ethiopia. Numerous hydroclimatic variables and scenarios were developed to assess the pattern of rainfall during different seasons. The average annual precipitation varies between -37.3%, +33.1%, and -38.2%, +61.2%, for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The anticipated declines in mean seasonal rainfall changes for the Bega and Belg seasons range from -69.6% to 88.4% and from -60.6% to 15.2% for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Climate models predict that the average periodic precipitation considered for the Kiremt season will vary from -12.1% to 1.33%. The Belg, Kiremt, and Bega seasons will likely see a 28.2%, 12.2%, and 22.6% drop in mean seasonal precipitation, respectively. The decrease in stream flow accompanied by the aforementioned climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) can be as high as 19.6% and 6.7%, respectively. Also, the amount of discharge will reduce in the near future because of a substantial reduction in rainfall and a rise in evapotranspiration in the catchment. This decline in stream flow has its own effect on the future availability of water resources. The research finding is vital to environmental protection authority, decision makers, and scientific community to undertake climate change adaption techniques for rain scare areas. A program combined with multi-RCMs to evaluate climate change effects on hydrometeorology generated a novel approach to this research with appropriate adaptation mechanisms.

J	Baseer, A; Ali, Z; Ilyas, M; Yousaf, M				Baseer, Abdul; Ali, Zulfiqar; Ilyas, Maryam; Yousaf, Mahrukh			A new Monte Carlo Feature Selection (MCFS) algorithm-based weighting scheme for multi-model ensemble of precipitation	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Global circulation models; Precipitation; Ensemble	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CMIP6; IMPACT	Changes in patterns of meteorological parameters, like precipitations, temperature, wind, etc., are causing significant increases in various extreme events. And these extreme events, i.e., floods, heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, etc., lead to a shortage of water resources, crop failures, wildfires, and economic losses. However, Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are considered the most important tools for quantifying climate change. Therefore, we selected 20 different GCMs of precipitation in our research, as the frequency of extreme events, like drought and flood, is highly related to changes in precipitation patterns. However, this research introduced a new weighting scheme - MCFSAWS-Ensemble: Monte Carlo Feature Selection Adaptive Weighting Scheme to Ensemble multiple GCMs, whereas, Monte Carlo Feature Selection (MCFS) is one of the most popular algorithms for discovering important variables. However, the proposed weighting scheme (MCFSAWS-Ensemble) is mainly based on two sources. Initially, it evaluates the prior performance of each GCM model to define their relative importance using MCFS. Then, it computes value by value difference between the observed and simulated model. In addition, the application of this paper is based on the monthly time series data of precipitation in the Tibet Plateau region of China. In addition, we used twenty GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to analyze the implications of the MCFSAWS-Ensemble. Further, we compared the performance of the MCFSAWS-Ensemble scheme with Simple Model Averaging (SMA) through Mean Average Error (MAE) and correlation statistics. The results of this research indicate that the proposed weighting scheme (MCFSAWS-Ensemble) is more accurate than the SMA approach. Consequently, we recommend the use of advanced machine learning algorithms such as MCFS for making accurate multi-model ensembles.

Recently, the real-time control (RTC) of storages has been considered as a means to reduce peak flows and potentially avoid major infrastructure up-grades. This paper introduces a RTC approach, the Target Flow Control (TFC) approach, which is able to maintain system outflows at or below specified target flows (e.g., existing system capacity). The key features of the approach are that it does not require calibration to catchment specific data, as is the case for existing ap-proaches and is only based on storage level information measured in real-time during rainfall events. This makes the approach generally applicable to different catchments and able to respond to future changes in rainfall due to land use and/or climate change. The TFC approach is tested on a simple two-storage system for 750 design rainfall events from a range of climates, event durations, rainfall intensities and temporal patterns using a practically achievable control time step of 30 s. Results show that the TFC approach can achieve the desired target flows effectively, with 95% of the experiments having less than 10% errors in target flows. This is an exciting achievement, given the TFC approach does not require calibration and only requires measurable storage level information. The outcomes highlight the potential of the TFC approach as a practical RTC approach that can maximize the effectiveness of existing stormwater conveyance systems by maintaining stormwater system out-flows at desired target flows, thereby potentially avoiding stormwater infrastructure upgrades due to land use and climate change.

In this study, the success and failure of typical coastal protection works of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are reported and documented from field observations over a study period of 10-15 years. The coastal protection structures evaluated include revetments, geotubes, t-shaped bamboo fences, Pile-rock breakwaters, Busadco's breakwaters, Semi-Circular breakwaters, and Hollow triangle breakwaters. This paper briefly reviews the current situation of coastline erosion problem and accretion in the VMD and illustrates the severity of the current erosion rate that threatens the safety of coastal communities. The paper then evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various coastal management approaches currently in practice in the VMD to classify different types of possible measures for coastal management with the aim to find holistic measures for planning which require low construction investment. Integrated coastal management and planning are outlined at a regional scale followed by the lessons learned from the previous coastal protection works, and finally the multiple lines of defense (MLD) solution is proposed, which is a green infrastructure inspired nature-based solution. The MLD solution can improve biodiversity, facilitate mangrove forest restoration, and ensure sustainable livelihoods for local communities. Integrated coastal planning and management solutions that are based on the MLD principle are expected to withstand coastal disasters under future climate change, and sea-level rise on the VMD.

An open workflow to gain insights about low-likelihood high-impact weather events from initialized predictions	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; climate model ensemble; climate risk; Copernicus Climate Change Services; seasonal predictions; Weather extremes	EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; EXTREME WEATHER; CLIMATE EXTREMES; WAVE EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; RISK; ATTRIBUTION; ENSEMBLE; FORECAST; DROUGHT	Low-likelihood weather events can cause dramatic impacts, especially when they are unprecedented. In 2020, amongst other high-impact weather events, UK floods caused more than 300 pound million damage, prolonged heat over Siberia led to infrastructure failure and permafrost thawing, while wildfires ravaged California. Such rare phenomena cannot be studied well from historical records or reanalysis data. One way to improve our awareness is to exploit ensemble prediction systems, which represent large samples of simulated weather events. This 'UNSEEN' method has been successfully applied in several scientific studies, but uptake is hindered by large data and processing requirements, and by uncertainty regarding the credibility of the simulations. Here, we provide a protocol to apply and ensure credibility of UNSEEN for studying low-likelihood high-impact weather events globally, including an open workflow based on Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) seasonal predictions. Demonstrating the workflow using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) SEAS5, we find that the 2020 March-May Siberian heatwave was predicted by one of the ensemble members; and that the record-shattering August 2020 California-Mexico temperatures were part of a strong increasing trend. However, each of the case studies exposes challenges with respect to the credibility of UNSEEN and the sensitivity of the outcomes to user decisions. We conclude that UNSEEN can provide new insights about low-likelihood weather events when the decisions are transparent, and the challenges and sensitivities are acknowledged. Anticipating plausible low-likelihood extreme events and uncovering unforeseen hazards under a changing climate warrants further research at the science-policy interface to manage high impacts.

Eight extreme precipitation indices were computed using the reference period data obtained from nine meteorological stations and dynamically downscaled outputs of GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR global circulation models (GCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The biases in the outputs of GCMs were corrected by using the linear scaling method. The Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho tests were utilized to detection of the trend in the precipitation indices during the reference (1971-2000) and future periods (2020-2099). The results of the analyses for the reference period showed a strong increasing trend in indices in the eastern part of the basin and nonsignificant trends (both increasing and decreasing) in the western part. On the other hand, for the future period, the results demonstrated that the amount of total precipitation will increase (a positive trend in PRCPTOT). However, the number of dry days will increase. This situation indicates that there will be no significant change in the total amount of precipitation, but there will be an increase in the intensity of precipitation and the number of dry days during the coming years that can cause flooding and drought, respectively. Therefore, suitable adaptive and mitigative actions have to be taken, especially in terms of urban planning and agriculture.

AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Mediterranean; climate change; artificial wetlands; nest-site selection; return rate; breeding success	CHARADRIUS-ALEXANDRINUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EGG CRYPSIS; FARMLAND; LANDSCAPE; IMPACTS; DUBIUS	Climatic scenarios for the Mediterranean predict an increase in drought and erratic precipitation, which may affect waterbirds breeding in freshwater habitats. Artificial wetlands may provide an alternative for these species when conditions in natural habitats deteriorate. We studied Little Ringed Plovers Charadrius dubius nesting in natural streams and agricultural ponds in southern Portugal. Based on 24 nests and 31 colour-ringed adults, we describe nest-site characteristics, breeding parameters and site fidelity. In streams, nests (n =17) were in sites with more abundant and coarser gravel, while in ponds there was more vegetation around the nest (n = 7). In both habitats, nests were close and at similar distances to water, but this was unrelated to nest outcome (success of 30.8% across habitats). Nest failure in natural streams was mostly attributable to flooding after heavy rains, while in agricultural ponds cattle trampling was the main cause of failure. Based on their renesting capacity and relatively high breeding site fidelity (25%-36% return rate to same area), we suggest that Little Ringed Plovers may trade-off the overall better conditions of natural streams (i.e. higher availability of nesting substrate, food resources and lower disturbance from cattle) against the stochastic risk of floods. Nevertheless, under current predictions of climate change, agricultural ponds can provide more stable and reliable nesting conditions for this and other species, as unpredictable changes in Mediterranean streams' flooding regimen may become more frequent. Despite the limitations of our dataset, we provide novel information on the breeding biology of this understudied species and highlight its potential for future research.

GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Climate change; Victim compensation; Disaster insurance; EU	ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION; GOVERNMENT; INSURANCE; COMPETITIVENESS; MARKET	Just as in many other regions of the world, the European Union is prone to nearly all types of natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Moreover, due to climate change, both the number of incidents and the damage from natural disasters could increase. Natural disasters may cause significant economic losses, and consequently there is a strong demand for compensation for victims in their aftermath. We examine whether, from a theoretical perspective, there is any role to be played at the EU level in the compensation of victims of disasters, particularly in disaster insurance, and even if it were to be just a facilitative role, how this role could take shape in order to stimulate the insurability of natural disasters. We critically examine European initiatives with respect to disaster insurance and ex post compensation and formulate lessons learned on the basis of the theoretical analysis. We explicitly address the question whether the role of the EU should be limited to facilitating insurability or whether it should include providing ex post compensation to states as well.

For some time, coastal retrogradation may follow a historically observed trend. However, a slight increase in ocean and climate indices, including sea level, temperature, and precipitation, can cause significant modification in the littoral profile. This study reports the recent changes and possible future threats along the Mahin mud coastline, Ilaje Local Government Area of Nigeria, West Africa. This study aims to understand the present evolution of the coastal area in order to manage the environmental and human risks in the future. Satellite images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) map in the Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to evaluate the retreat rates of 20 years and delineate flooded coastal areas under some sea level rise (SLR) scenarios. Results showed that the areas of retreat dominance in recent years were once mostly accreting. In comparison, some areas that were receding have gained more land. Still, the rates of retreat in other areas have further intensified. Based on the DEM map analysis results, coastal flooding may very soon extend several kilometers inland, covering large areas of the southeastern sector. Therefore, this observation is essential to ensuring appropriate coastal protection plans are put in place.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The impacts of long-term precipitation aand land use change on the annual surface runoff were quantitatively analysed using various methods for the period of 1948-2019.New hydrological insights: We found that abrupt change occurred in 2009 for precipitation and 2003 for runoff, and the slope of precipitation-runoff cumulative curve changed after 2000 with an increase of-122 %. This indicated that human activities in the early 2000 s may have resulted in a marked increase of runoff in addition to precipitation. The dominant land use transfer was from croplands to constructed lands, most profoundly during 2000-2010. The multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the increase of precipitation and the cropland-to-constructed land transitions were nearly equally responsible for the runoff increase. In total, the long-term precipitation and major land use change explained-79 % of annual runoff variation. Furthermore, the effect of surface water area especially the pond area was discussed, and the negative linear relationship was found not statistically significant, but the impact of pond area ratio and its storage capacity on peak flow during rainstorms is worth further exploration towards flood mitigation, which can serve as an important and effective measure for nature-based management.

J	Zhao, JZ; He, SP; Wang, HJ				Zhao, Jiazhen; He, Shengping; Wang, Huijun			Historical and future runoff changes in the Yangtze River Basin from CMIP6 models constrained by a weighting strategy	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						summer runoff; Yangtze River Basin; CMIP6; weighting strategy; model skill; model independence	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGY; MONSOON	Based on the ERA5-Land datasets from 1981-2020, a decadal oscillation has been found in the variation of summer runoff in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). The oscillation suggests that the MLYRB will experience increased runoff in the next few decades after 2020, which saw a record high runoff in the MLYRB. The decadal changes in summer runoff over the MLYRB under various climate change scenarios are then analyzed with direct runoff outputs from 28 general circulation models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Given that the equal-weighted multi-model ensemble mean could not well represent the historical runoff changes in the MLYRB, in this paper we introduce a model weighting scheme that considers both the model skill and independence. It turns out that this scheme well constrains the models to represent the observed decadal changes of summer runoff. The weighted mean projections suggest that the summer runoff in the MLYRB during 2015-2100 under all warming scenarios will be higher than the present day; and 2021-2040 is likely to be a period with significantly increased summer runoff. Results of the present study have great implications for flood control and effective water resources management over the MLYRB in the future, and the weighting approach used in this paper can be applied to a wide range of projections at both regional and global scales.

J	Das, J; Manikanta, V; Umamahesh, NV				Das, Jew; Manikanta, Velpuri; Umamahesh, N., V			Population exposure to compound extreme events in India under different emission and population scenarios	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Compound extreme; CMIP6; Climate change; Population exposure; India	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; DATA SET; TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT; INCREASE; RISK; RAINFALL; IMPACT; CHINA; DRY	It is well understood that India is largely exposed to different climate extremes including floods, droughts, heat waves, among others. However, the exposure of co-occurrence of these events is still unknown. The present analysis, first study of its kind, provides the projected changeability of five different compound extremes under three different emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). These changes are combined with population projection under SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5 scenarios to examine the total exposure in terms of number of persons exposed during 2021-2060 (T1) and 2061-2100 (T2). Here, the outputs from thirteen GCMs are used under CMIP6 experiment. The findings from the study show that all the compound extremes are expected to increase in future under all the emission scenarios being greater in case of SSP5-8.5. The population exposure is highest (2.51-to 4.96-fold as compared to historical) under SSP3-7.0 scenario (2021-2100 i.e., T1 and T2) in case of coincident heat waves and droughts compound extreme. The total exposure in Central Northeast India is projected to be the highest while Hilly Regions are likely to have the lowest exposure in future. The increase in the exposure is mainly contributed from climate change, population growth and their interaction depending on different kinds of compound extremes. The findings would help in devising sustainable policy strategies to climate mitigation and adaptation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Prütz, R; Månsson, P				Prutz, Ruben; Mansson, Peter			A GIS-based approach to compare economic damages of fluvial flooding in the Neckar River basin under current conditions and future scenarios	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Climate change; Flood damage; Fluvial flood; GIS; Neckar River; Strength of knowledge	RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARDS; INUNDATION; MITIGATION; IMPACTS; TOOLS	Fluvial floods can cause significant damages and are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency throughout the twenty-first century due to global warming. Alongside hazard characteristics, damage potentials depend on exposure and vulnerability, which are changing in the wake of socio-economic developments. In the context of continuously evolving damage-causing factors, assessments of future changes in flood damage potentials are increasingly asked for by decision-makers in flood risk management. This study addresses this need by (a) providing a systematic review of contemporary assessment approaches to quantitatively compare direct economic losses from fluvial flooding under current and future conditions and (b) combining the reviewed approaches to an applicable methodology which is used in a case study to quantify changing flood damage potentials in the Neckar River basin in southern Germany. Therefore, a scoping study of contemporary flood damage assessment approaches supported by geographic information systems (GIS) is performed. The subsequent case study of the Neckar River prognoses a significant increase in average annual flood damages in the study area throughout the twenty-first century. The case study produces valid results with regards to current precipitation data, whereas the absence of verification data makes the validation of projected scenarios more difficult. To account for uncertainties surrounding these future projections, a nascent qualitative confidence estimation is introduced to reflect on the strength of knowledge underlying the used flood damage assessment methodology.

In relation with climate change, more frequent floods, of higher intensity, can be expected due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The objective of this review paper is to address the many ways in which geosynthetics contribute to sustainable construction of dykes and thus to water systems management. This review paper, prepared by the four Technical Committees and the Sustainability Committee of the International Geosynthetics Society, briefly describes geosynthetics and their function, dykes and dyke failure modes, before presenting the main focus of the use of geosynthetics for the design and construction of durable dykes to ensure the protection of life and infrastructure. The optimization of dyke construction with geosynthetics to increase their resilience not only results in performance advantages, but also in economic advantages. The way geosynthetics can contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions for a sustainable river management is discussed. This is done not only by allowing more economic construction methods to be implemented, but also solutions with increased resilience to face the extreme stresses related to climate change, while at the same time bringing about a positive contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the construction process itself. Finally, it is shown that by following state of the art standards and design practice any possible risk associated with the use of geosynthetics in dykes can be mitigated.

Interacting Infrastructure Disruptions Due to Environmental Events and Long-Term Climate Change	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						sea level rise; infrastructure dependencies; shoreline adaptation; transportation infrastructure	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ELECTRICITY DEMAND; TIDAL DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; EXTREME; SYSTEMS	Climate change places additional stress on critical infrastructure systems as demand for resources (e.g., water and electricity) increases and environmental disruptions (e.g., flooding and wildfires) become more frequent and severe. Interconnected infrastructure systems may be particularly vulnerable, as disruptions in one system can cascade to other systems and increase the severity of impacts. To ensure continued functionality, infrastructure systems must be designed or adapted to account for changing environmental conditions, with consideration for the interactions between systems. For this study, we examine the dependencies between shoreline protective infrastructure and transportation infrastructure in the context of sea level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area. Shoreline modifications implemented in one location can cause hydrodynamic feedbacks that exacerbate flooding and associated disruptions elsewhere. On the other hand, the decision not to implement shoreline protection can cause local flooding of roadways that leads to traffic feedbacks and system-wide travel delays. We compare the magnitude of these feedbacks, in terms of vehicle hours traveled (VHT), across a range of county-level shoreline scenarios to characterize the effects of one county's shoreline adaptation decisions on its neighbors. Our results show that VHT increases by as much as 7.2% due to hydrodynamic feedbacks and 10.7% due to traffic feedbacks. Comparing these effects for each scenario allows for targeted decision-making about adaptation approaches that account for both the local effects of flood disruptions and the regional network effects driven by infrastructure interactions.

Under the conditions of climate change and rapid urbanization, the evaluation of flood risk can lead to the success of adaptation strategies. The main objectives of this study are the estimation of future direct flood damage in two urban watersheds: The Pasig-Marikina-San Juan River in Metro Manila, Philippines, and the Ciliwung River in Jakarta, Indonesia, as well as the determination of the relation between factors that drive floods and flood damage. A spatial analysis approach based on the integration of several parameters, such as flood hazard, climate, and property value, was applied using a Geographic Information System (GIS). The flood depth-damage function generated from the field surveys was employed for the analysis to identify the spatial distribution of flood loss. The findings showed that, under future scenarios (target year: 2030), the total flood damage will increase by 212% and 80% in the target areas of Manila and Jakarta, respectively, compared to the current scenarios. This growth is due to the higher level of extreme rainfall events and to the degree of urbanization in the future. A comparative analysis of the two study areas highlighted the significant effects of the level of water depth and the inundated areas on flood damage, depending on the sites. This study is useful for local decision makers to implement suitable strategies for urban planning and flood control.

Typology of coastal urban vulnerability under rapid urbanization	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; ADAPTATION; CITIES; 21ST-CENTURY; PROJECTIONS; PHILIPPINES; POPULATION; RESILIENCE; VALIDATION	Coastal areas are urbanizing at unprecedented rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Combinations of long-standing and emerging problems in these urban areas generate vulnerability for human well-being and ecosystems alike. This baseline study provides a spatially explicit global systematization of these problems into typical urban vulnerability profiles for the year 2000 using largely sub-national data. Using 11 indicator datasets for urban expansion, urban population growth, marginalization of poor populations, government effectiveness, exposures and damages to climate-related extreme events, low-lying settlement, and wetlands prevalence, a cluster analysis reveals a global typology of seven clearly distinguishable clusters, or urban profiles of vulnerability. Each profile is characterized by a specific data-value combination of indicators representing mechanisms that generate vulnerability. Using 21 studies for testing the plausibility, we identify seven key profile-based vulnerabilities for urban populations, which are relevant in the context of global urbanization, expansion, and climate change. We show which urban coasts are similar in this regard. Sensitivity and exposure to extreme climate-related events, and government effectiveness, are the most important factors for the huge asymmetries of vulnerability between profiles. Against the background of underlying global trends we propose entry points for profile-based vulnerability reduction. The study provides a baseline for further pattern analysis in the rapidly urbanizing coastal fringe as data availability increases. We propose to explore socio-ecologically similar coastal urban areas as a basis for sharing experience and vulnerability-reducing measures among them.

However, human activities have resulted in wetland loss in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), while the wetland distribution in this area shows great discrepancy in previous estimates. It is, therefore, imperative to estimate the distribution of potential wetlands at present and project their variation under future climate change scenarios. In this study, we simulate the wetland distribution in the MLYRB at 15 '' resolution using 5 machine learning methods with 19 predicting factors of topographic index, vegetation index, climate data, hydrological data, and soil type data. A 5-fold cross-validation with observed permanent wetlands shows that the reconstructions from Adaptive Boosting tree (AdaBoost) algorithm have the highest accuracy of 97.5%. The potential wetland area in the MLYRB is approximately similar to 1.25 x 10(5) km(2), accounting for 15.66% of the study region. Direct human activities have led to the loss of nearly half of the potential wetlands. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments with the well-trained models are performed to quantify the response of the total wetland area to each influencing factor. Results indicate vulnerability of wetland areas to increases in leaf area index (LAI), coldest season temperature, warmest season temperature, and solar radiation. By the 2100s, the potential wetland area is expected to decrease by 40.5% and 50.6% under the intermediate and very high emissions scenarios, respectively. The changes in LAI and the coldest season temperature will contribute to 50% and 40% of this loss of potential wetlands, respectively. Wetland loss may further undermine biodiversity, such as waterfowl, and fail to provide functions such as flood protection, and water supply. This work reveals the spatial pattern of potential wetland areas and their sensitivity to climate changes, stressing the need for effective strategies to mitigate wetland loss at specific regions in the MLYRB.

However, the characteristics of the forces in driving the variations of hydrological health at long-short time scales (annual, seasonal, monthly), as well as the potential impacts of these variations on aquatic habitats, remain unclear. In this study, the flow threshold method was introduced to identify the inherent characteristics of river hydrological health degree (RHD) evolution in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (URYR) through the extreme-point symmetric modal decomposition (ESMD) method and range of variation approach (RVA). The RHD under unregulated conditions was reconstructed to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change. Subsequently, a multifractal model was proposed to establish the relationship between RHD and habitat-weighted usage area (WUA) during the spawning period of the Four Famous Major Carps, aiming to analyze the response mechanisms of habitat conditions to RHD fluctuations. The results showed that the RHD in the URYR exhibited degradation characteristics, experiencing a moderate change with a value of 0.44. Climate change was identified as the dominant factor causing the annual-scale decline in RHD, with an average impact weight of 62.9%. At the annual scale, Anthropogenic activities exacerbate (-3.4), counteract (20.1), and counteract (20.5) the adverse climatic impacts at Yichang, Cuntan, and Zhutuo stations, respectively. Additionally, the effect of human activities during the flood season is slight, with the most favorable and unfavorable impacts occurring in December (50.7) at the Zhutuo station and in October (-27.2) at the Yichang station. Under the influence of driving forces, the multifractal correlation of the RHD-WUA system tended to homogenized as the time window increased, indicating the presence of potential nonlinear dependence, asymmetric fractal characteristics, and positive-to-negative persistence transitions. Therefore, modeling river health considering fish habitat cannot be limited to linear paradigms. The findings provide valuable insights for the management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.

J	Higashino, M; Hayashi, T; Aso, D				Higashino, Makoto; Hayashi, Terumasa; Aso, Daiki			Temporal variability of daily precipitation concentration in Japan for a century: Effects of air temperature rises on extreme rainfall events	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Precipitation concentration index; Lorenz curve; Air temperature rises; In -equalities in precipitation distribution; Climate change; Japan	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; RIVER-BASIN; WATER-RESOURCES; FLOOD; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; HYDROLOGY; TRENDS; CHINA	Climate change induced by air temperature rises may have a significant impact on change in rainfall patterns. Indeed, flood disasters due to downpours have increased over the last few decades in Japan. This study considers the Lorenz Curve, a concept used in economic theory, to describe spatial-temporal variability in the daily time series of precipitation concentration. The results reveal that annual average air temperature has risen at 10 rural sites and 5 urban sites over the period from 1901 to 2020 (120 years). The obtained trends are positive, and statistically meaningful at the 1% level. Whereas, annual precipitation has not changed significantly in the period (1901-2020) since obtained trends at all 15 sites are non-statistically meaningful (p > 0.01). In the meantime, annual maximum daily precipitation has increased for 1 of 15 sites, i.e. Ishigaki, while annual maximum hourly precipitation has increased for 4 of 15 sites, i.e. Choshi, Sapporo, Tokyo and Fukuoka. Calculated Gini coefficient, i.e. the precipitation concentration index (CI) has increased at all 15 sites in the period (1901-2020). The trends are positive, and statistically significant (p < 0.01). This indicates that rainfall has become more concentrated into a fewer rainy days throughout a year as the air temperature has risen for the 120 year period. The correlation between the precipitation CI and warming trends of individual monthly average air temperatures are weak, i.e. almost no correlation, for April, May, June, and November. Whereas, the obtained Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rho s = 0.78 and 0.72 indicate a strong correlation between the trend in air temperature rises and the trend in precipitation CI for July and August. This suggests that air temperature rises during summer (July and August) play an important role in the change in precipitation characteristics throughout Japan.

The Inland Niger Delta (IND), located within the Sahelian zone of Central Mali, is a large floodplain that has experienced a historically-significant period of recurrent drought from 1970 to 1994 followed by a recovery of floods since. Vegetation associations, as determined through 2014 fieldwork at 538 IND sites, were compared to the sites' vegetation associations as mapped in 1982. Site-specific flood histories were constructed through the analysis of Landsat imagery across the 1982-2014 period. In more deeply flooded portions of the floodplain, observations of vegetation associations in 2014 show remarkable consistency with those existing in 1982. In areas flooded infrequently and for the shortest duration, vegetation trajectories are more complicated with evidence for bush encroachment noted at 4.5% of all sites. Flood history explains only a portion of the few site-specific changes observed over the study period. Significant changes were more likely to be associated with more recent flood history (post 1999) rather than the flood history during the preceding abnormally dry period (1982-1991). These findings point to remarkable resiliency of IND vegetation to widely fluctuating levels of flooding that are driven not only by rainfall and run-off across the watershed but also by land use, water withdrawals and damming upstream. Given the low species diversity of IND vegetation, its resiliency derives from the combination of the seasonal plasticity of perennial grass growth in relation to rainfall and flood regimes and the efficiency of their vegetative and reproductive propagation in the context of highly seasonal grazing. The co-occurrence of interannual resiliency of the IND vegetation with annual vegetation production varying significantly with annual rainfall-flood conditions is consistent with non-equilibrium ecosystem dynamics.

To cope with these floods and to reduce their impacts, households can adopt some preventive behaviours. The main goal of this research was to compare the adoption of flood mitigation behaviours in three populations presenting distinctive characteristics with a valid and an invariant measure of behavioural adaptation, as well as a baseline measure (comparison group). The article also aims to test the moderated effect of having experienced a flood on the relation between the perception of risk of being flooded and the adoption of preventive behaviours. A survey was conducted in flood-prone areas and in some areas that were not at risk in Quebec, Canada, through phone interviews. Results confirmed that people who lived in an at-risk area and had experienced past flooding events are more inclined to adopt preventive behaviours than people who lived in an at-risk area but had never experienced such an event, and those who lived outside at-risk areas. In addition, our results indicate that the at-risk population who have never experienced a flood engage in few flood preventive behaviours. This is worrisome, as their rate of adopting adaptive behaviour is very similar to the one seen in populations living outside at-risk areas, despite the increased risk inherent to their situation. This could be partly explained by our data showing that around a quarter of the at-risk population did not know they were living in a flood-prone area. Our results show that communication efforts are necessary in order to better inform the population of the risk related to living in a flood-prone area and that incentives should be developed to help enhance the rate of preventive behaviours in at-risk populations having never experienced a flood.

In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of various regional versions of the climate models, RCMs, and the commonly available weather datasets in Kenya in predicting extreme weather patterns in northern and western Kenya. We identified two models that may be used to predict flood risks and potential drought events in these regions. The combination of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and weather station data was the most effective in predicting future drought occurrences in Turkana and Wajir with accuracies ranging from 78 to 90%. In the case of flood forecasting, isolation forests models using weather station data had the best overall performance. The above models and datasets may form the basis of an early warning system for use in Kenya's agricultural sector.

JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLOOD RISK; PROPERTY PRICES; IMPACTS	There is a growing international consensus that climate change represents one of the most important structural forces and risks that long-term investors need to proactively consider in building resilient portfolios. Many institutional real estate investors have significant exposure to cities and regions that are economically important but increasingly susceptible to climate change impacts. In this article, we review and synthesize existing academic research on risk exposure to acute and chronic climate-related events and forces and their impacts on property asset values and lending practices. Evidence to date is dominated by studies focused on residential property, although some recent research has begun to examine the commercial real estate sector in a more rigorous way. We draw inferences from the residential studies for how these findings might apply to commercial real estate and highlight the more recent studies focused on commercial property. Recent research is published within both real estate and broader economics and finance journals; these articles indicate that awareness of climate risks is having a more sustained impact on pricing and on investor decision making, although the channels through which impact occurs are generally opaque and warrant further research.

The news media can shape post-disaster policy debate by directing the attention of policymakers towards problems and solutions and framing the nature of support or opposition to policy change. For these reasons, scholars have devoted increasing attention to the policy influence of the media over public policies to address hazards, particularly floods. However, the nature of news media coverage following flood disasters is largely unexplored in Canada. Through a content analysis of newspaper coverage around two of Canada's most significant floods, this paper examines whether and how the media frame flooding as a policy problem. The results reveal that the Canadian media are focused more on the short-term impacts of hazards than on the policy problems that underpin flood risk. In addition, the study confirms relationships found in previous research between media content and the substance of policy discussions, which could inform a broader multijurisdictional comparison of media coverage and hazard policy.

The expected increase in rainfall leads to an increase of runoff that is directly linked to the stability of existing and newly installed hydraulic structures. It is necessary to accurately estimate the future frequency and severity of floods, considering increasing rainfall according to different climate change scenarios. After collecting observed flood data over twenty years in 12 watersheds, we developed a regional frequency analysis (RFA) for ungauged watersheds by adjusting flood quantiles calculated by a design rainfall-runoff analysis (DRRA) using natural flow data as an index flood. The proposed RFA was applied to estimate design floods and flood risks in 113 medium-sized basins in South Korea according to representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. Regarding the future of the Korean peninsula, compared with the present, the flood risks were expected to increase by 24.85% and 20.28% on average for the RCP 8.5 and 4.5 scenarios, respectively.

Analysis of precipitation variability over Satluj Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India: 1901-2013	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; rainfall variability; Satluj Basin; trend analysis	RAINFALL	Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in the Indian Himalayas, which spreads over an area of 55,000 km(2). The state has a unique geography, which influences the climatic variability of the state. In the present study, Satluj Basin has been considered as a study area. This basin experiences frequent floods, erratic distribution of rainfall and climatic variabilities, which causes extensive damage over the basin. Precipitation is one of the most crucial meteorological variables which determines the impact of climate change in the Himalayan landmass. For spatial and temporal variation of precipitation, long-term precipitation data of 113 years (1901-2013) was utilized. Further, non-parametric, i.e. Mann-Kendall (MK) and modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) tests, were performed to check possible trends and Sen's slope estimator (SSE) test was used for determining the change in magnitude over the basin at 95% level of significance. The entire analysis was performed on a monthly, annual and seasonal (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter) basis. In this study, it was noticed that both positive and negative trends are detected in monthly and seasonal time series. It was also noticed that similar results have been estimated in MK, MMK and Sen's slope estimator tests during 1901-2013.	[Tirkey, Nity; Parhi, P.

The present study adapts a framework and provides broad estimations for sand volumes and costs required to apply beach nourishment to each coastal zone in Thailand using a technique based on the Bruun rule assumption. Results indicate that a minimum of USD 2981 million (the best scenario) to a maximum of USD 11,409 million (the worst scenario) would be required to maintain all sandy beaches at their present width. Further, the effect of filling particle size on beach nourishment was analyzed in this study. The cost of beach nourishment ranges between USD 1983 and 14,208 million when considering filling particle size diameters of 0.5 and 0.2 mm. A zonal sand volume map for all 51 sandy beach zones in Thailand was created for use as an overview to help decision makers develop a more feasible adaptation plan to deal with the future sea-level rise for Thailand.

Extreme weather events, such as excessive precipitations, are increasing in intensity and frequency under climate change, which pose a flood risk to pavement infrastructure. The impact of flooding on pavements has become a rising concern since pavements are designed based on historical data, which do not adequately reflect current and future climate. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the flooding impacts on pavements is of great importance. The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of flooding on pavement performance. Damage pattern, flood characteristics, impact factor analysis and a case study were performed. The Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide is employed to simulate the effect of 36 extreme hydrologic events on 2 typical pavement designs in Ontario, Canada. Extreme precipitation magnitude, number of event cycles and duration were loaded on typical pavement structures. Results show that there is no significant damage caused by short-duration exposure of extreme precipitation, and extreme events contribute to international roughness index changes. The increase of the number of event cycles leads to the increase of damage ratio. In addition, the loss of pavement life is unneglectable for long duration and higher cycle extreme events.

Tomorrow's disasters - Embedding foresight principles into disaster risk assessment and treatment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster risk management; Risk assessment; Foresight; Scenarios; Risk treatment	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT; GLOBAL EXPOSURE; NATURAL HAZARDS; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; FUTURE; MITIGATION	Disaster risk is a complex, uncertain and evolving threat to society which changes based on broad drivers of hazard, exposure and vulnerability such as population, economic and climatic change, along with new technologies and social preferences. It also evolves as a function of decisions of public policy and public/private investment which alters future risk profiles. These factors however are often not captured within disaster risk assessments and explicitly excluded from the UN General Assembly definition of a disaster risk assessment which focuses on the current state of risk. This means that 1) we cannot adequately capture changes in risk and risk assessments are out of date as soon as published but also 2) we cannot show the benefit of proactive risk treatments in our risk assessments. This paper therefore outlines a generic, scale-neutral, framework for integrating foresight - thinking about the future - into risk assessment methodologies. This is demonstrated by its application to a disaster risk assessment of heatwave risk in Tasmania, Australia, and shows how risk changes across three future scenarios and what proactive treatments could be possible mitigating the identified drivers of future risk.

For this reason, it is essential to provide the authorities with tools for managing the hazards and risks associated with coastal events. The purpose of the To-SEAlert project is to develop, implement, and validate a set of tools and methodologies based on a WebGIS to monitor, prevent and manage wave overtopping and flooding emergencies caused by coastal events. In this work, XBeach software was used to model the effects of storm induced wave overtopping and sea erosion in a low-lying sandy shore in Costa da Caparica, Portugal. Two experiments were carried out, simulating a storm event in a segment and in a grid area. Results show beach and dune erosion and wave overtopping, similar to recorded effects in past events, and important limitations are discussed. The improvement of these simulations can be essential to input data on the To-SEAlert project model, allowing its objectives accomplishment.

The global rate of SLR observed by the long records of satellite altimeters (1993-2011) is at 3.11 mm/yr with the mean rate at Southeast Asia (SEA) slightly higher at 3.9 mm/yr (1993-2009). Many countries in SEA face the risk of SLR highlighting the flood dangers. In addition to the land prone to sinking, several countries like Indonesia face extreme SLR events. To provide an understanding of the SLR rates in SEA, this paper answers several questions associated with SLR in SEA. What are the factors that contributed to the SLR on regional scales? How can the SLR be mathematically modelled? How much has the sea level increased over the past decades based on the observed tide gauge, radar altimeters and data assimilation techniques? SLR from these techniques is reviewed because they provide the complete spectrum of processes that lead to sea-level variability. Finally, the prospects for future research are summarized in order to provide guidance for the future SLR studies.

'From the sky to the ground': fishers' knowledge, landscape analysis and hydrological data indicate long-term environmental changes in Amazonian clear water rivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Local ecological knowledge; Environmental impacts; Small-scale fisheries; Climatic changes; Dams; Landcover changes	LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TAPAJOS RIVER; LAND-COVER; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; TOCANTINS RIVER; FLOOD PULSE; DEFORESTATION; DROUGHT; FOREST	Fishers possess detailed local ecological knowledge (LEK) which can be a valuable resource for tracking long-term environmental changes in less studied tropical rivers. Our goal was to investigate such changes in three clear water rivers in the Brazilian Amazon, focusing on hydrology, water quality and land cover. Additionally, we aimed to compare these changes among three rivers (Trombetas, Tapaj ' os and Tocantins) representing a potential gradient of environmental changes. We interviewed 129 fishers (67 in Tapaj ' os, 33 in Tocantins and 29 in Trombetas), and analyzed temporal series on land cover and hydrology respectively through maps produced by the project MapBiomas, and data from the Brazilian National Water Agency across the last 34 years (from 1985 to 2019). The complementary analyses of these three databases (mapping, hydrological data and fishers' knowl-edge) revealed environmental changes in the studied rivers. The maps showed a gradient of anthropic changes on land cover, from the less altered Trombetas river, the moderately altered Tapaj ' os and the more intensely changed landscape in the Tocantins River. Fishers from the Tocantins River reported a greater variety of negative changes	[Nunes, Carolina B.; Vieira, Kaluan C.; Pereyra, Paula E. R.; Silvano, Renato A.

This article describes how climate change and extreme weather impact vulnerable riparian communities and settlements. The analysis is done by reviewing past research and empirical case studies from riparian rural communities of the impact zone of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, the world's most extensive mangrove forest. The article discusses the climate-related impacts on households through a Severity Index of Vulnerability and assesses the adaptation responses they may pursue. The principal climate-related vulnerabilities and impacts due to increases in temperature, storm surges, sea flooding, and sea-level rise are seawater intrusion and riverbank erosion. Many households have adopted several autonomous reactive adaptation strategies rather than planned ones, to cope with these impacts. However, government organisations and NGOs provide less than optimal technical and financial support to households for planned and anticipatory adaptive responses. The main barriers to adaptation were the high cost of improved crop varieties, inadequate agricultural extension services, and a lack of knowledge on effective climate adaptation. The restoration of the mangrove ecosystem may increase its resilience and, among other things, make local communities less exposed. The article also presents some adaptation measures proper to reduce the climate-related vulnerability of riparian settlements.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SHOOT GROWTH; ROOT; COMMUNITIES; ENDOPHYTES; DIVERSITY; TOLERANCE; STRESS; YIELD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Leaf microbiota mediates foliar functional traits, influences plant fitness, and contributes to various ecosystem functions, including nutrient and water cycling. Plant phenology and harsh environmental conditions have been described as the main determinants of leaf microbiota assembly. How climate change may modulate the leaf microbiota is unresolved and thus, we have a limited understanding on how environmental stresses associated with climate change driven weather events affect composition and functions of the microbes inhabiting the phyllosphere. Thus, we conducted a pot experiment to determine the effects of flooding stress on the wheat leaf microbiota. Since plant phenology might be an important factor in the response to hydrological stress, flooding was induced at different plant growth stages (tillering, booting and flowering). Using a metabarcoding approach, we monitored the response of leaf bacteria to flooding, while key soil and plant traits were measured to correlate physiological plant and edaphic factor changes with shifts in the bacterial leaf microbiota assembly. In our study, plant growth stage represented the main driver in leaf microbiota composition, as early and late plants showed distinct bacterial communities. Overall, flooding had a differential effect on leaf microbiota dynamics depending at which developmental stage it was induced, as a more pronounced disruption in community assembly was observed in younger plants.

A new mission: Mainstreaming climate adaptation in the US Department of Defense	CLIMATE SERVICES			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Risk management; Complex organizations; Military operations; Base management	LANDSCAPE; COPRODUCTION; INFORMATION; BARRIERS	The United States Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes growing climate risks across its responsibilities as land manager, operator of hundreds of installations, and in its core mission to protect national security. However, DoD climate risk reduction is complicated by frequent leadership turnover among base commanders, which encourages focus on near-term challenges, and changing US government priorities that downplay climate risk. We used risk-based deliberation, through workshops, with climate scenario-based fire and flood impact modeling to evaluate risk and adaptation opportunities at bases in the southwestern United States. We found that success in working with Defense installations hinges on linking risks of increasing climate-related impacts to DoD's ability to achieve its mission objectives at installations. Workshop participants offered insights into barriers to adaptation, including access to decision-makers in a hierarchical organization, leadership focus on near-term challenges, insufficient training or capacity to integrate climate information into short and long-term decisions, and rapid turnover in leadership. We also found opportunities for mainstreaming climate risk management into DoD activities, including emphasizing risks to DoD's mission, opportunities to form symbiotic partnerships with external partners, and the potential for standardized procedures for considering physical climate risks that could be integrated across the DoD to achieve longer-term solutions to climate change challenges.

J	Feinberg, DS				Feinberg, Daniel S.			What factors predict the quality of hazard mitigation plans in Washington State?	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Adaptation; Collaboration; Diffusion; Hazard mitigation		Hazard mitigation plans can help to reduce communities' losses when faced with natural hazards, some of which (e.g., floods) are projected to intensify with climate change. A growing body of plan evaluation literature seeks to measure the quality of these plans, given that higher-quality plans may be more likely to achieve their objectives (e.g., reducing a community's losses from flooding). Processes of collaboration (i.e., joint decision-making by various agencies and stakeholders) and diffusion (i.e., the spread of ideas between jurisdictions over time and space), among others, may influence plan quality, although empirical evidence is limited. This study assessed potential predictors of plan quality for 33 county-level hazard mitigation plans in Washington State, using a combination of survey data, county characteristics, and previously determined plan quality scores. Significant predictors of plan quality included indicators of vertical (state-to-county) and horizontal (county-to-county) diffusion, as well as economic capacity, although indicators of collaborative dynamics, along with several other hypothesized predictors, including past disaster experience (i.e., severity) were not significant. Hazard planning professionals at the federal, state, and local levels may benefit from integrating these findings into future work, in conjunction with other climate change adaptation initiatives. Specifically, fostering peer-to-peer interactions between counties might help to produce and disseminate knowledge about climate solutions.

These hazards enhance erosion processes and flooding events, producing severe socio-economic impacts and posing a challenge to ocean engineers and stakeholders in finding the optimal strategy to protect both the coastal communities and the health of the environment. The impact of coastal hazards is actually worsened not only by an enhancing rate of relative sea level rise and storminess driven by climate changes, but also by increasing urban pressure related to the development of the sea economy. With regard to larger environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study focuses on a stepwise approach that supports the actions for coastal protection at Calabaia Beach, which is located in the Marine Experimental Station of Capo Tirone (Cosenza, Italy). These actions first aim to protect humans and coastal assets, then to restore the environment and the local habitat, overcoming the need for the emergency interventions carried out in the last decades and pointing out that healthy ecosystems are more productive and support a sustainable marine economy ("Blue Growth").

Altogether 24 and 21 local stakeholders were approached for survey in the Madi and Deukhuri valleys, respectively. We assume multiple factors and stakeholders' perceptions influence the policies and practices at the local level. We found floods, droughts, cold waves and riverbank erosion to be the major climatic hazards that eventually impacted on agriculture, livestock and properties. It was found that the farmers dealt with these impacts based on traditional knowledge and practices, followed by the support provided by stakeholders and neighbors/communities. The major supports provided were mainly on training and awareness, risk analysis, livelihood and financial support, coordination and networking, and facilitating policy formulation. They emphasized the capacity enhancement, appropriate technologies, community-based planning, prioritization of the poor and marginalized, community funds as the top priorities for the communities. The public stakeholders are influential in adaptation policies/plans, whereas private and civic stakeholders are influential in adaptation practices. An issue-/interest-based governance model is effective and sustainable with the active participation of stakeholders. Thus, a shift from the position-based to the issue-/interest-based model is appropriate in climate adaptation in Nepal.

Particularly, in Bangladesh, climate-smart agriculture practices (CSAPs) are promoted as a practical tool for mitigating and adapting to climate change in an effort to enhance pro-ductivity. Despite myriad studies on determinants of CSAPs adoption, complements and sub-stitutes among CSAPs are seldom emphasized and recognized, thus up till now policy has not been cogently informed on how to satisfactorily promote adoption of multiple CSAPs in salinity risk hotspots. Therefore, the aim of this present study is to examine the factors that affect the like-lihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bangladesh with special emphasis on compliments and substitutes. To this end, survey and plots level observation data were collected from 600 farm households and 1260 plots in flood prone areas, respectively. Also, five CSAPs are under consideration - use of stress tolerant varieties (STV), intercropping with legumes (ICL), minimum tillage (MT), crop rotation with legumes (CRL) and furrow irrigated bed planting (FIBP). Multivariate and ordered Probit models were applied to achieve the objectives of the study. In the interest of effective climate action, we find two sets of complementary CSAPs (STV x ICL x MT or STV x ICL x FIBP) and substitutes (CRL with ICL and MT or FIBP with MT). Key determinants of complements are sources of information, training on CSA, extension service, and government support. Therefore, the study strongly recommends effectively coordinating the functions of multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers, and concerned government departments at the local level to enhance successful adoption of multiple CSAPs (compliments). This is pivotal especially against the background of the sustainable development goals on climate action as it could potentially recuperate the dynamism of agriculture in salinity risk hotspots of Bangladesh.

The projected increase in extreme precipitation has been associated with greater floods; however, most recent studies have argued that the reduced soil moisture could be causing the opposite effect. We aim to understand how the hydrometeorological variables affect flood discharge and what the projections are for South America, a vulnerable continent that has been barely studied regarding flood trends. We used climate data from Eta simulations nested in 4 global climate models (BESM, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5) as input for the MGB-SA hydrological model to yield flood discharge estimates. Then we were able to project the climate impacts on extreme precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and flood discharge for large rivers (>1,000 km2) and understand how these variables are related. Our results showed a strong sign that antecedent soil moisture is expected to be reduced in most of the continent except in Southeastern South America (SESA). On the other hand, there are mixed signs for rarer precipitation and a clear spatial pattern for 2-year precipitations (RP2), which is expected to increase on the SESA and west Amazon and decrease on Central South America (CSA). For basins>100,000 km2, results indicate a negative change sign for 2-year precipitations, meaning that rainfall events that generate ordinary floods in large South American rivers are expected to decrease in the XXI century due to climate change. The change signs for flood discharge and extreme precipitation are spatially similar but more basins show a decrease for flooding than for rainfall. While only half of the South American basins are expected to present reduced 2-year precipitations, nearly 70 % of the rivers present a negative sign for 2-year floods, which can be attributed to the reduced antecedent soil moisture.

In the study, a Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator were used to analyze rainfall trends and their magnitude, respectively, under monthly, seasonal, and annual timeframes as an indication of climate change using different natural and geographical contexts (i.e., sub-regions, climate zones, major river basins, and countries). The study finds that the highest annual rainfall trends were recorded in Rwanda (11.97 mm/year), the Gulf of Guinea (river basin 8.71 mm/year), the tropical rainforest climate zone (8.21 mm/year), and the Central African region (6.84 mm/year), while Mozambique (-0.437 mm/year), the subtropical northern desert (0.80 mm/year), the west coast river basin of South Africa (-0.360 mm/year), and the Northern Africa region (1.07 mm/year) show the lowest annual rainfall trends. There is a statistically significant increase in the rainfall in the countries of Africa's northern and central regions, while there is no statistically significant change in the countries of the southern and eastern regions. In terms of climate zones, in the tropical northern desert climates, tropical northern peninsulas, and tropical grasslands, there is a significant increase in rainfall over the entire timeframe of the month, season, and year. This implies that increased rainfall will have a positive effect on the food security of the countries in those climatic zones. Since a large percentage of Africa's agriculture is based only on rainfall (i.e., rain-fed agriculture), increasing trends in rainfall can assist climate resilience and adaptation, while declining rainfall trends can badly affect it. This information can be crucial for decision-makers concerned with effective crop planning and water resource management. The rainfall variability and trend analysis of this study provide important information to decision-makers that need to effectively mitigate drought and flood risk.

Floodplain soils situated downstream of urban or industrial catchments, which were traditionally considered a sink of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) arriving from the river reach, may now become a source of legacy pollution to the surrounding environment, if PTEs are mobilised by unprecedented flooding events. When a soil floods, the mobility of PTEs can increase or decrease due to the net effect of five key processes; (i) the soil redox potential decreases which can directly alter the speciation, and hence mobility, of redox sensitive PTEs (e.g. Cr, As), (ii) pH increases which usually decreases the mobility of metal cations (e.g. Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+), (iii) dissolved organic matter (DOM) increases, which chelates and mobilises PTEs, (iv) Fe and Mn hydroxides undergo reductive dissolution, releasing adsorbed and co-precipitated PTEs, and (v) sulphate is reduced and PTEs are immobilised due to precipitation of metal sulphides. These factors may be independent mechanisms, but they interact with one another to affect the mobility of PTEs, meaning the effect of flooding on PTE mobility is not easy to predict. Many of the processes involved in mobilising PTEs are microbially mediated, temperature dependent and the kinetics are poorly understood. Soil mineralogy and texture are properties that change spatially and will affect how the mobility of PTEs in a specific soil may be impacted by flooding. As a result, knowledge based on one river catchment may not be particularly useful for predicting the impacts of flooding at another site. This review provides a critical discussion of the mechanisms controlling the mobility of PTEs in floodplain soils. It summarises current understanding, identifies limitations to existing knowledge, and highlights requirements for further research. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Future streamflow regime changes in the United States: assessment using functional classification	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FLOW DURATION CURVES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CATCHMENT CLASSIFICATION; HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; REGIONAL PATTERNS; PHYSICAL CONTROLS; WATER-RESOURCES; DATA SET; MODEL	Streamflow regimes are changing and expected to further change under the influence of climate change, with potential impacts on flow variability and the seasonality of extremes. However, not all types of regimes are going to change in the same way. Climate change impact assessments can therefore benefit from identifying classes of catchments with similar streamflow regimes. Traditional catchment classification approaches have focused on specific meteorological and/or streamflow indices, usually neglecting the temporal information stored in the data. The aim of this study is 2-fold: (1) develop a catchment classification scheme that enables incorporation of such temporal information and (2) use the scheme to evaluate changes in future flow regimes. We use the developed classification scheme, which relies on a functional data representation, to cluster a large set of catchments in the conterminous United States (CONUS) according to their mean annual hydrographs. We identify five regime classes that summarize the behavior of catchments in the CONUS: (1) intermittent regime, (2) weak winter regime, (3) strong winter regime, (4) New Year's regime, and (5) melt regime. Our results show that these spatially contiguous classes are not only similar in terms of their regimes, but also their flood and drought behavior as well as their physiographical and meteorological characteristics. We therefore deem the functional regime classes valuable for a number of applications going beyond change assessments, including model validation studies or predictions of streamflow characteristics in ungauged basins. To assess future regime changes, we use simulated discharge time series obtained from the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model driven with meteorological time series generated by five general circulation models. A comparison of the future regime classes derived from these simulations with current classes shows that robust regime changes are expected only for currently melt-influenced regions in the Rocky Mountains. These changes in mountainous, upstream regions may require adaption of water management strategies to ensure sufficient water supply in dependent downstream regions.

This study aimed at assessing the perception of institutional stakeholders and limitations on coping strategies in flooding risk management in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) and Lome (Togo). Using a transdisciplinary framework, the methodological approach basically relied on qualitative data collected through desk review and key informant interviews with various stakeholders, covering a range of topics related to flooding risk. Findings show that flooding experiences cause serious environmental and health problems to populations. Poor hygiene practices and contacts with contaminated water are the main causes of risks. Collaboration between stakeholders is limited, reducing the efficiency of planned interventions. Furthermore, health risk prevention strategies are still inadequately developed and implemented. Findings also show limited capacities of affected and displaced people to cope and plan for their activities. Engaging various stakeholders in the health risk prevention plans is likely to improve the efficiency of coping strategies in flooding risk management in West Africa.

By using long ground-based daily records of rainfall and surface temperature at the Lisboa-Geofisico climatological station, the analysis aimed to identify (i) long-term and recent climate trends in rainfall and temperature, (ii) changes in extreme rainfalls, heatwaves, and droughts, and (iii) possible effects of the coupled changes of minimum and maximum daily temperatures (Tmin and Tmax, respectively) on drought development based on the diurnal temperature range (DTR) indicator. To detect these trends and quantify their magnitude, the Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests were implemented. The analysis of the mean annual temperatures indicated that the study area has warmed similar to 1.91 degrees C through the 157 analysed years. Results evidenced statistically significant upward trends in both Tmin and Tmax, and in the number of Tmax heatwave days. In what concerns the extreme hydrological events, the analysis of annual maximum rainfall series and peaks-over-threshold (POT) techniques showed more frequent and intense events in recent years, reaching up to similar to 120.0 mm in a single day. With regard to drought, the study proved that the characterisation based on the commonly used standardised precipitation index (SPI) might differ from that based on the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), as the latter can take into account not only rainfall but also temperature, an important trigger for the development of drought. According to the SPEI index, severe and extreme drought conditions have been more frequent in the last 60 years than in any other recorded period. Finally, a decreasing DTR trend towards the present was found to influence evapotranspiration rates and thus drought characteristics.

With nearly 4000 publications, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is clearly one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models worldwide. The model has been widely used for projecting the impacts of future hydro-climatic changes, but application for extreme streamflow conditions is still rarely reported. To date, SWAT application reviews have focused on compilations of SWAT studies for specific or relatively new applications such as eco-hydrological modelling, ecosystem services, sub-daily simulations, and pesticide fate and transport simulations. However, no existing SWAT review studies have focused on simulation of hydro-climatic extremes. Therefore, this research aims to bridge this gap by compiling and reviewing the findings of studies reporting SWAT hydro-climatic extremes including highlighting the performance and future research needs. A total of 111 articles have been identified since 1999; most of these studies were conducted in the United States and China. These articles can be divided into extreme flow assessments, drought studies, flood studies, drought and flood studies, SWAT coupling with other models, and SWAT improvements. Most of the extreme performance assessment studies reported "satisfactory" performance, with a particular emphasis on peak flow comparisons. Future research needs regarding this topic include: (1) a unified SWAT extreme performance assessment framework; (2) SWAT improvements that result in improved replication of peak and low flows; (3) reliability assessment of global and satellite products for SWAT extreme simulations; (4) bias correction of CMIP6 and regional climate projections; (5) comparison of SWAT+ and SWAT for extreme flow simulations in different types of basins; (6) development of an extreme flow module within an overall SWAT modelling system; and (7) integration of artificial intelligence within SWAT modelling.

Spatial heterogeneities of current and future hurricane flood risk along the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Natural hazards; Hurricane storm surge; Geographic information system (GIS); Spatial risk distribution; Coastal resilience	NEW-YORK-CITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; NATURAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURGE THREAT; FRAMEWORK; LANDSCAPE; DISASTERS; PATTERN	We evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of hurricane flood risk along the United States (US.) Atlantic and Gulf coasts under two different climate scenarios (current and future). The flood hazard is presented as the hurricane surge flood level with 1% annual exceedance probability (100-year flood) under the two scenarios, where the future scenario considers the effect of hurricane climatology change and sea level rise towards late-21st-century under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). This hazard information is combined with estimated vulnerability and disaster resilience of coastal communities to map the relative current and future risk employing different risk definitions. Several geographical techniques and spatial distributional models (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, spatial hotspot analysis, and spatial multivariate clustering analysis) are applied to systematically analyze the risk and identify statistically significant hotspots of the highest risk. Most of the high-risk hotspots are found in the Gulf coast region, particularly along the west coast of Florida. However, two out of three risk evaluation approaches also indicate New York City as a risk hotspot under the future climate-showing that the resultant risk is sensitive to the consideration of evaluation factors (i.e., hazard, vulnerability, and resilience). Additionally, we apply a machine-learning algorithm-based spatial multivariate approach to map the spatially distinct groups based on the values of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and resilience. The results show that the counties in the highest risk group (value >3rd quartile, 15% of total counties, including New York City) in the future lack specifically in the community capital and the social components of community resilience. This assessment of coastal risk to hurricane flood has important policy-relevant implications to provide a focus-for-action for risk reduction and resilience enhancement for the US., where 6.5 million households live in the hurricane flood-prone areas.

Research has found that displacement does cause negative health impacts to evacuees, but few studies have observed how planned sheltering might reduce adverse health impacts. This article identifies the good practice and lessons learned from China's response to severe flooding in Anhui province in 2016. Methods: First, we identified the key phases for disaster sheltering by analyzing related government reports. We then interviewed 21 relevant professionals in order to identify good practice and lessons learned which could lead to better health outcomes (e.g., reduce fatalities, infectious diseases, and mental health problems). Interviewees were selected through a purposive sampling strategy, which identified emergency management professionals and those who had been assigned evacuation, sheltering, or medical tasks. Finally, thematic analysis and the constant comparative method were used to code, identify, and describe the good practice and challenges during key phases. Results: Good practice included: using early warning systems to advise communities of risks and enforce evacuation in the flood zone; preparing and using schools as shelters with open-ended periods of operation; and, providing stable shelter accommodations which offered medical and public health services, clean drinking water and food, sanitation, and toilet hygiene through multiagency cooperation. Challenges included: providing mental health services, evaluating intervention effectiveness, managing volunteers, monitoring long-term health effects, and providing economic support. Conclusions: The unintended negative effects caused by sheltering during extreme weather can be reduced. This requires close cooperation among government entities to establish planned mass shelters with appropriate levels of personal, environmental and healthcare support and to ensure long-term physical and mental health support. Additionally, if disaster mitigation strategies are integrated with climate adaptation plans, we can design more health-oriented and sustainable cities. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As the largest tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Yalong river is known for its abundant hydropower resources, and the world's largest multi-energy complementary base has been built in the Yalong River Basin. However, prudent water resource planning is limited by the lack of long-term, detailed and reliable streamflow records over the Yalong river basin. Here, we develop an October-June streamflow reconstruction for the Yalong River, based on composite tree-ring chronology of Picea likiangensis from seven sampling sites. The reconstruction goes back to 1480 CE, and accounts for 46.5% of the instrumental streamflow variance during 1962-2012. This record indicates that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation were the major contributing factors to streamflow variations. A significant and stable correlation with temperature was found over the past few centuries on the interannual scale. Projections suggest that future climate change may lead to more frequent flood disasters in the Yalong River Basin.

There are five groups of optimization algorithms that have been applied to find the optimal reservoir rule curves: the trial and error technique with the reservoir simulation model, dynamic programing, heuristic algorithm, swarm algorithm, and evolutionary algorithm. The application of an optimization algorithm with the considered reservoirs is presented by focusing on its efficiency to alleviate downstream flood reduction and drought mitigation, which can be explored by researchers in wider studies. Finally, the appropriate future rule curves that are useful for future conditions are presented by focusing on climate and land use changes as well as the participation of stakeholders. In conclusion, this paper presents the suitable conditions for applying optimization techniques to search for optimal reservoir rule curves to be effectively applied in future reservoir operations.

Factors contributing to the range expansion and population increase of a native generalist species	AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA			English	Article						competition; habitat degradation; red-eared slider; Trachemys scripta elegans; turtle population	TRACHEMYS-SCRIPTA-ELEGANS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; MAP TURTLE; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; SPECIALIST; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS	Ecological communities are becoming more typified by generalist species in conjunction with anthropogenic activities. Using a long-term dataset (1968-2019), we documented the expansion of a native generalist species, the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), into a river community, and studied the subsequent population changes that occurred in conjunction with short-and long-term changes within the ecosystem. Trachemys scripta elegans was able to expand into a new geographic area following a harvesting-induced population decline of a native competitor, the northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica). The population of T. s. elegans remained small for approximately 2.5 decades, then significantly increased in conjunction with habitat degradation in the form of increased silt/sediment deposits and nuisance aquatic vegetation growth. Our results demonstrate how a generalist species can expand and establish a population in an area impacted by multiple anthropogenic stressors. This research reveals how ecological communities become characterized by more generalist species following anthropogenically-induced competitive release caused by harvesting of native competitors, habitat degradation, and extreme flooding associated with land cover and climate change.

J	Strauss, K				Strauss, Kendra			Introduction to Displacements	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Editorial Material						climate change; displacement; infrastructure; labor; migration; mobility; urbanization	MIGRATION	In the first months of 2020, the call for papers for the 2022 Special Issue of the Annals of the American Association of Geographers was circulated. It invited papers that engage with multiple forms and meanings of displacements and their geographies: patterns of shifting, dislocation, or putting out of place; substitutions of one idea for another or the unconscious transfer of intense feelings or emotions; activities occurring outside their normal context; and replacements of one thing by another. The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization shortly after, produced new displacements and intensified existing patterns of displacement and dispossession, including human and more-than-human mobilities and immobilities. At the same time, socionatural displacements-floods, fires, droughts, hurricanes, sea-level rise, species loss, and dislocation-were the backdrop to the displaced and deferred hopes of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The twenty-seven articles in this special issue contend with how we as geographers conceptualize and theorize displacements; the range of sites, spaces, processes, affects, scales, and actors we study with to understand them; and what is at stake politically in how we research displacements. It is also a pandemic archive of academic labor, in which we find traces of displacements within and beyond our discipline.

In this framework, flood-based farming systems (FBFS) enable the use of floodwater as an opportunity for crop production. FBFS have received much attention recently; however, there is limited guidance on how they can be promoted effectively in rural areas. To do so and to support the adoption of appropriate systems, it is important to understand the current practice of FBFS. This study focuses on the Balaka District (Malawi) and the types of FBFS in use, the extent of practice, and the factors behind their adoption. A sample size of 398 farmers was considered, using questionnaires, observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to collect primary data. The results showed flood recession agriculture (FRA), depression agriculture, spate irrigation, and inundation canals and dugouts among the FBFS used and that FRA was the dominantly adopted method (54%). Lack of capital investment and level of farmer awareness were the factors most associated with FBFS adoption with p = .00003 and p = .004, respectively. Capital investment and actions to increase farmers' awareness should therefore be considered to realize the full benefits of FBFS.

In the United States, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands, some factors (such as perceived costs) have similar influences on household adaptation to flooding, but others (such as flood experience) differ between countries. Understanding social and behavioural drivers and constraints of household adaptation is essential to effectively address increasing climate-induced risks. Factors shaping household adaptation are commonly treated as universal, despite an emerging understanding that adaptations are shaped by social, institutional and cultural contexts. Using original surveys in the United States, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands (N = 3,789), we explore variations in factors shaping households' adaptations to flooding, the costliest hazard worldwide. We find that social influence, worry, climate change beliefs, self-efficacy and perceived costs exhibit universal effects on household adaptations, despite countries' differences. Disparities occur in the effects of response efficacy, flood experience, beliefs in governmental actions, demographics and media, which we attribute to specific cultural or institutional characteristics. Climate adaptation policies can leverage the revealed similarities when extrapolating best practices across countries yet should exercise caution, as context-specific socio-behavioural drivers may discourage or even reverse household adaptation motivation.

In this study, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 global climate models are analyzed to identify robust signals of projected changes in summer and winter precipitation extremes over the United States (US). Under a projected fossil-fuel based economic (i.e.high greenhouse gas emissions) scenario, our results show consistent changes in the seasonal patterns for many precipitation extremes by the end of the 21st century. We find a robust projected increase in the intensity of winter precipitation across models, with less agreement during the summer. Similarly, a robust projected amplification of heavy precipitation over the northern US is evident in winter, while intermodel spread is prevalent in summer projections. Specifically, the heavy and very heavy winter precipitation days (R10mm and R20mm) exhibit larger increases compared to other aspects of precipitation. Additionally, changes in dry extremes (e.g. consecutive dry days) are found to differ significantly across various subregions and seasons. Overall, our results suggest that the US may suffer more natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the future.	[Akinsanola, A. A.; Kooperman, G.

This paper employed a waterlogging process simulation model for flat irrigation districts in the paddy fields to simulate floods under different scenarios. The scenarios of the rainfall conditions, initial storage depths, and work scales are designed, respectively. The risk of flood damage increases as rainfall increases, with a maximum increase of 62.8%, comparing the extreme scenario with the current scenario. A moderate rise in pumping station flow and using pre-rain drainage measures in the paddy fields can effectively reduce waterlogging loss. The total regional flood damage was reduced by up to 10.9%, 15.8%, and 35.9% when the pump station flow in the study area was increased by 10%, 20%, and 30%. The insights from this study of the possible future extreme flood events may help flood control planning.

However, green infrastructures cannot completely protect against hazards. Therefore, this study investigates the public preference in Japan for DRR and its uncertainty using a survey-based choice experiment. The results showed that benefits were obtained from the increase in "success probability", "reduction in human damage", "reduction in property damage", and "reduction in indirect damage"; however, the benefits obtained from additional improvements diminished. Moreover, the results of our analyses revealed that preferences for DRR and its uncertainty were heterogeneous among respondents, and the population segment that includes more women, older people, and more people who live in areas that may be directly affected by floods had higher ratings for "success probability" and relatively slightly lower ratings for "reduction in indirect damage".

Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy to analyse three consecutive general elections in the United Kingdom (2015, 2017 and 2019), the paper finds variability in partisan electoral benefit from one election to the next that calls into question the blind retrospection and rally-round-the-leader explanations which are often advanced to account for electoral reactions to natural disasters. Instead, changing party positions on environmental issues appear to account more convincingly for shifts in electoral support in response to flooding. This suggests that parties can derive benefit from, or be punished for, the positions they take on environmental issues when extreme weather events affect citizens.

Climate Change and Human Well-Being in the 2020s: Lessons From 2020	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Review						climate change; adaptation; public health; extreme weather	HEALTH IMPACTS; WILDFIRE; FLOODS	Behind the coronavirus headlines the year 2020 set multiple extreme weather records, including unprecedented wildfires in Australia and California, massive flooding in China, and back-to-back hurricanes in Central America. The impacts on the well-being of local populations have been devastating. We reviewed these extreme weather events, together with the year's newly published climate and health science reports, and identified three important themes for building health resilience in the decade ahead: (1) preparing for greater magnitude and intensity of climate hazards, extreme events, and population health impacts; (2) better anticipating cascading and compound impacts on population well-being, particularly for the most vulnerable; and (3) identifying appropriate, effective preparedness tools and strategies. While decarbonizing the economy is the urgent goal to protect both human and planetary health from a changing climate, 2020 demonstrates that recognizing the likely magnitude and complexity of future extreme weather events, and preparing local public health agencies and communities with the knowledge and tools to respond to them, will be essential in this critical decade.

For this purpose, multifunctional stormwater infrastructures such as water plazas appear promising as there is a high competition for open space in most urban areas. Yet, to date only very few water plazas have been realized with at least one implementation hampered by a lack of public acceptance. In this study, semi-structured interviews are used to investigate how plans to build a water plaza in the city of Cologne are perceived by local residents. Factors crucial to public acceptance are identified. Experience with flooding, knowledge of the planned construction and awareness of benefits turned out to be important for acceptance, whereas social and personal norms were less relevant. The identified factors led to finding recommendations to promote public acceptance of innovative climate adaptation measures like water plazas.

Impacts of climate and land use change on hydrodynamics and sediment transport regime of the Ganga River Basin	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrodynamic; Extreme events; Ganga River; Flood; Morphology	WATER-BALANCE; FLOOD RISK; MODEL; AVULSION; KOSI; GEOMORPHOLOGY; URBANIZATION; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	Under climate change and pressure from human activities, extreme flood events are becoming a significant concern. The study involves setting up a coupled hydroclimate-hydrodynamic models over the Ganga River Basin by coupling the CORDEX regional climate models to the physically based Soil Water Assessment Tool-based hydrological model and MIKE 21C-based hydrodynamic model. The coupled model was employed to explore the flood inundation and dynamics of sediment mobilization amid various extreme events under future conditions. The water level, particularly for the 40-year return period for the late century (2061-2100), is estimated to rise in the future (0.9-1.2m). Since extreme streamflow has increased in the future, morphological transformations will also aggravate. Moreover, during the extreme events, the peaks in shear stress and velocity profile distribution have a propensity to coincide with the areas of the meander bend, implying that the river meander processes govern the shifts in the dynamics of the sediment transport. Additionally, the developed model framework has been employed to determine the areas affected and inundation pattern due to the 18 August 2008 flood in the Kosi River due to the embankment breach. Simulation exhibited that there is a good agreement between the simulated and observed inundation areas. Together with the evaluation of the susceptibility corresponding to lives and livelihoods, this information may facilitate decision-makers to develop ameliorative policies and adopt meaningful measures to alleviate the impacts.

J	Kisinger, C; Matsui, K				Kisinger, Chakma; Matsui, Kenichi			Responding to Climate-Induced Displacement in Bangladesh: A Governance Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate-induced displacement; rehabilitation; resettlement; cluster village; Bangladesh		Population displacement by extreme weather events have long plagued Bangladesh, a low-lying disaster-prone river delta. The country experiences yearly displacement of approximately one million people and losses of about 1% of its gross domestic product due to cyclones, floods, and riverbank erosion. This study examines how the Bangladesh government has managed climate-induced displacement with a particular focus on socioeconomic development policies. We analyzed the country's 1984 Land Reform Ordinance, the 2009 climate change strategy and action plan, the 1997 agricultural Khasland settlement policy, perspective plan for 2010-2021, poverty reduction strategy paper, and five-year plans to understand governance changes for displaced communities. We found that, overall, the central government implemented four main strategies. In the first strategy, Bangladesh resettled displaced people in cluster villages on public lands. Then, it provided life skills training (e.g., leadership, disaster preparedness, income generation) to rehabilitate the residents. The third strategy was to align resettlement efforts with local-level climate change adaptation and poverty reduction activities. Here, the central government and its seventeen departments collaborated with local councils to support resettled households under the social safety program. The fourth strategy was to diversify financial resources by obtaining more fund from donors and establishing its own financial mechanism. However, we also found that the decision-making and implementation process remained top-down without need assessment and community participation. This paper intends to offer insights on how similar challenged countries and regions may respond to climate displacement in the future.

Extreme sea-level events, rare in the recent past (i.e., once per century), are projected to occur at least once per year by 2050 along many of the world's coastlines. Information showing where and how built-environment exposure increases with SLR, enables timely adaptation before damaging thresholds are reached. This study presents a first national-scale assessment of New Zealand's built-environment exposure to future coastal flooding. We use an analytical risk model framework, "RiskScape", to enumerate land, buildings and infrastructure exposed to a present and future 100-year extreme sea-level flood event (ESL100). We used high-resolution topographic data to assess incremental exposure to 0.1 m SLR increases. This approach detects variable rates in the potential magnitude and timing of future flood exposure in response to SLR over decadal scales. National built-land and asset exposure to ESL100 flooding doubles with less than 1 m SLR, indicating low-lying areas are likely to experience rapid exposure increases from modest increases in SLR expected within the next few decades. This highlights an urgent need for national and regional actions to anticipate and adaptively plan to reduce future socio-economic impacts arising from flood exposure to extreme sea-levels and SLR.

Storm surge return levels induced by mid-to-late-twenty-first-century extratropical cyclones in the Northeastern United States	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE WINTER; EAST-COAST; CMIP5; MODEL; CLIMATOLOGY; PROJECTIONS; AMERICA; IMPACT; RISE	We investigate the impact of climate change on the storm surges induced by extratropical cyclones (ETCs) between November and March. We quantify changes to the storm surge between a historical period (1979-2004) and a future period during the mid to late twenty-first century (2054-2079) for a number of major coastal cities in the Northeastern United States. Observed water levels are analyzed to estimate storm surges induced by ETCs during the historical period. A hydrodynamic model is utilized to simulate storm surges induced by ETCs projected for the future climate by seven global climate models. The biases in the hydrodynamic and climate models are calculated and removed from the simulated surge heights. Statistical methods, including the peaks-over-threshold method, are applied to estimate the storm surge return levels. We find that future projections based on most of the climate models indicate relatively small effects of climate change on ETC storm surges. The weighted-average projections over all climate models show a small increase in storm surge return levels (less than 7% increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights). However, uncertainties exist among the climate models and projections from one climate model show a substantial increase in the storm surge return levels (up to 27% and 36% increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights, respectively). These uncertainties, and likely the larger impact of sea level rise, should be accounted for in projecting the risk posted by ETC flooding.

Water quality modelling of the Mekong River basin: Climate change and socioeconomics drive flow and nutrient flux changes to the Mekong Delta	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mekong River; Nutrients; Modelling; Climate change; Socioeconomic change; Land use change; Vietnam Delta	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; GANGES-BRAHMAPUTRA-MEGHNA; NITROGEN MODEL; CATCHMENTS INCA; SYSTEM IMPACTS; DYNAMICS; INDIA; RUNOFF; SCALE; ASIA	The Mekong delta is recognised as one of the world's most vulnerable mega-deltas, being subject to a range of environmental pressures including sea level rise, increasing population, and changes in flows and nutrients from its upland catchment. With changing climate and socioeconomics there is a need to assess how the Mekong catchment will be affected in terms of the delivery of water and nutrients into the delta system. Here we apply the Integrated Catchment model (INCA) to the whole Mekong River Basin to simulate flow and water quality, including nitrate, ammonia, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus. The impacts of climate change on all these variables have been assessed across 24 river reaches ranging from the Himalayas down to the delta in Vietnam. We used the UK Met Office PRECIS regionally coupled climate model to downscale precipitation and temperature to the Mekong catchment. This was accomplished using the Global Circulation Model GFDL-CM to provide the boundary conditions under two carbon control strategies, namely representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and a RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 4.5 scenario represents the carbon strategy required to meet the Paris Accord, which aims to limit peak global temperatures to below a 2 degrees C rise whilst seeking to pursue options that limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. The RCP 8.5 scenario is associated with a larger 3-4 degrees C rise. In addition, we also constructed a range of socio-economic scenarios to investigate the potential impacts of changing population, atmospheric pollution, economic growth and land use change up to the 2050s. Results of INCA simulations indicate increases in mean flows of up to 24%, with flood flows in the monsoon period increasing by up to 27%, but with increasing periods of drought up to 2050. A shift in the timing of the monsoon is also simulated, with a 4 week advance in the onset of monsoon flows on average. Decreases in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations occur primarily due to flow dilution, but fluxes of these nutrients also increase by 5%, which reflects the changing flow, land use change and population changes.

Climate change impact assessment on the water resources of the Upper Yamuna River Basin in India	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change; Hydrology; River basin; SWAT; Watershed	LAND-USE; SWAT MODEL; SENSITIVITY; CATCHMENT; QUALITY; TEMPERATURE; CALIBRATION; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; SCENARIOS	Climate change has ability to intensify the magnitude of flood and drought episodes, as well as their amplitude; also it has the potential to exacerbate hydrological extremes. It is crucial to forecast changes to hydrological regimes and determine the level of uncertainty around them to increase resilience and prepare for future changes. In order to enlighten long-term estimates, an attempt has been made to sustain the available water resources through Calibration and Validation of river discharge data using SWAT model for Upper Yamuna River Basin. Spatial climatic data were further crystallized to forecast climatic projection scenarios for Base line period, Mid-Century and End Century considering RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Result reveals that the average annual minimum temperature is estimated to be increased 1.4 degrees C in Mid-Century and 2.2 degrees C in End Century from the Base line Scenario while the average annual maximum temperature is found to be increased 1.5 degrees C in Mid-Century and 2.1 degrees C in End Century from the Base line Scenario. Further, while analyzing the hydrological components, Soil water percentage is expected to be increased in Mid-Century, whereas Percolation rate is found to be increased for all scenarios other than BL-MC (4.5) which is an indication of rise in Ground water. In addition to it, Surface flow is observed as a considerable increase from 4.33 to 72.69% in all scenarios. Also the Surface flow is more in case of End Century as compared to the Mid-Century. The estimated Ground water flow is found to be increased except BL-MC (4.5 & 8.5). Overall water yield has been estimated as a relative change from 7.06 to 18.70% based upon the specified conditions. The prediction for Evapotranspiration values is found as decreased in all scenarios except BL-MC (4.5 & 8.5). The outcome of the present study is very useful for planning of development strategies in the project area.

In East Africa, agricultural intensification is shifting from upland cultivation into the wetlands due to year-round water availability and fertile soils. These advantageous agricultural conditions might be hampered through climate change impacts. Additionally, water-related risks, like droughts and flooding events, are likely to increase. Hence, this study investigates future climate patterns and their impact on water resources in one production cluster in Tanzania. To account for these changes, a regional climate model ensemble of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa project was analyzed to investigate changes in climatic patterns until 2060, according to the RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathways) and RCP8.5 scenarios. The semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was utilized to analyze the impacts on water resources according to all scenarios. Modeling results indicate increasing temperatures, especially in the hot dry season, intensifying the distinctive features of the dry and rainy season. This consequently aggravates hydrological extremes, such as more-pronounced flooding and decreasing low flows. Overall, annual averages of water yield and surface runoff increase up to 61.6% and 67.8%, respectively, within the bias-corrected scenario simulations, compared to the historical simulations. However, changes in precipitation among the analyzed scenarios vary between -8.3% and +22.5% of the annual averages. Hydrological modeling results also show heterogeneous spatial patterns inside the catchment. These spatio-temporal patterns indicate the possibility of an aggravation for severe floods in wet seasons, as well as an increasing drought risk in dry seasons across the scenario simulations. Apart from that, the discharge peak, which is crucial for the flood recession agriculture in the floodplain, is likely to shift from April to May from the 2020s onwards.

Nevertheless, shifts in weather patterns have contributed to an increased incidence of these events in urban areas, where their impact can be amplified by the way the surrounding catchment is occupied. Hence, the present study sought to evaluate the susceptibility of the urban drainage infrastructure in Joao Monlevade, Brazil, to the effects of climate change by undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the Carneirinhos catchment, including its morphometric characteristics. For this purpose, we employed a hydrological model driven by regional rainfall projections from a high-resolution climate model (HadGEM2-ES downscaled to 5 km resolution) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5) scenario. Several combinations of rainfall occurrence were simulated, incorporating temporal aspects (different durations and return times), as well as spatial aspects (concentrated and distributed rainfall within the catchment). The results showed that the area of exposed soil in the Carneirinhos catchment experienced an increase of more than 140% from 2016 to 2019, favoring runoff surface and evaporation, which contributed to the increase in the number of flood events in the region. In addition, only 1 of the 56 heavy rainfall event simulations performed did not exceed the capacity of the macro drainage gallery.

Quantifying these impacts as they vary across regions, sectors, time, and social and climatological scenarios supports detailed planning, policy, and risk management. This article summarises and compares recent climate impact assessments in Europe (the JRC PESETA III project) and the USA (the American Climate Prospectus project). Both implement a multi-sector perspective combining high resolution climate data with sectoral impact and economic models. The assessments differ in their coverage of sectors and scenarios, mix of empirical and process-based methods, handling of uncertainty, and representation of damages. Despite the dissimilarities, projected relative economic impacts are comparable, with human mortality as the dominant impact category. Both studies further show a large spatial heterogeneity of impacts that may amplify pre-existing economic inequality in the EU and US, and that mitigation can considerably reduce economic impacts. The comparison highlights the various decision-points involved in interdisciplinary climate impact modelling and lessons learnt in both projects, on the basis of which we provide recommendations for further research.

They are, therefore, of little use for local development, risk prevention, and contingency planning. The aim of this article is to assess the flood risk, providing useful information for local planning and an assessment methodology useful for other case studies. As a result, the first step involves identifying the information required by the local plans most used south of the Sahara. Four rural communities in Niger, frequently flooded by the Sirba River, are then considered. The risk is the product of the probability of a flood multiplied by the potential damage. Local knowledge and knowledge derived from a hydraulic numerical model, digital terrain model, very high resolution multispectral orthoimages, and daily precipitation are used. The assessment identifies the probability of fluvial and pluvial flooding, the exposed areas, the position, quantity, type, replacement value of exposed items, and the risk level according to three flooding scenarios. Fifteen actions are suggested to reduce the risk and to turn adversity into opportunity.

Across China, future changes in urban drainage pressure (UDP) and its response to global-scale climate mitigation and local adaptation, have seldom been studied. Here, based on climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we assessed UDP changes from 2020 to 2099 under different scenarios in 285 cities across China. Under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 scenario, 30% larger increase of UDP relative to the baseline level (1985-2014), would occur in 22.80% and 79.65% cities over 2020-2049 and 2050-2099, respectively. Under climate mitigation (SSP2-4.5 scenario), UDP in northern China would decrease by 10-30% over 2020-2049. On this basis, 10% enhancement of underlying surface retention capacity (LID10% scenario) would reduce UDP by more than 10% particularly in northern and north-eastern China (23.51% cities). Pipe enlargement adaptation (Pipe10% scenario) would benefit UDP mainly in eastern China (46.31% cities), by postponing the first decade with 30% larger pressure relative to the baseline level by 1-3 decades.

Here, case studies are described to show that a focus on the shared dependence on freshwater ecosystem functioning can mutually benefit fisheries and conservation agendas in the Anthropocene. Meeting the threat to fish biodiversity and fisher livelihood is pertinent in developing regions where there is often a convergence between high biodiversity, high dependency on aquatic biota and rapid economic development (see Kafue River, Logone floodplain, Tonle Sap, and Rio Negro case studies). These case studies serve as evidence that biodiversity conservation goals can be achieved by emphasizing a sustainable fisheries agenda with partnerships, shared knowledge and innovation in fisheries management (see Kafue River and Kenai River case studies). In all case studies, aquatic biodiversity conservation and fisheries agendas are better served if efforts focused on creating synergies between fishing activities with ecosystem functioning yield long-term livelihood and food security narratives. A unified voice from conservation and fisheries communities has more socio-economic and political capital to advocate for biodiversity and social interests in freshwater governance decisions.

J	Lokidor, PL; Taka, M; Lashford, C; Charlesworth, S				Long'or Lokidor, Pauline; Taka, Miho; Lashford, Craig; Charlesworth, Susanne			Nature-based Solutions for sustainable flood management in East Africa	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						East Africa; ecosystem services; flood risk; nature-based solutions; sustainable flood management; urbanisation	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; POLICY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; BENEFITS; CLIMATE; HEALTH; CITIES; FOREST	Africa's population is expected to triple by 2050, owing to rapid urbanisation and overall demographic trends. The combined pressures of urbanisation and climate change impact the ecosystem and the services it provides. As a result, additional dangers such as increased flooding, and environmental disruption have risen. Therefore, devising adaptive solutions to mitigate flood risk impacts while also building community resilience is needed. Evidence suggests that Nature-based Solutions (NbS) can potentially alleviate floods and mitigate climate change impacts while also delivering other societal benefits. Despite rising NbS popularity following its recognition in the last decade, studies on its recognition in Africa remain limited. For this reason, this paper reviewed NbS studies conducted in East Africa (EA) to evaluate opportunities and barriers surrounding NbS adoption in EA. Academic literature published from January 2012 to May 2022 was reviewed using a comprehensive search of the SCOPUS database. Results show 14 papers have been published during the period, with the majority being post-2020.

J	Iwanek, M; Suchorab, P				Iwanek, Malgorzata; Suchorab, Pawel			Profitability Analysis of Selected Low Impact Development Methods for Decentralised Rainwater Management: A Case Study from Lublin Region, Poland	WATER			English	Article						decentralised drainage system; management of rainwater; economic profitability; effects of climate changes; financial support; Low Impact Development (LID)	ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; BENEFITS; SYSTEMS	Water scarcity affects at least 11% of the population and 17% of the territory of the European Union. Simultaneously in cities there is a problem of urban floods caused by violent and intense rainfalls. Decentralized drainage systems are designed to capture rainwater runoff at the place of precipitation and improve the hydrological conditions through the use of surface and subsurface infiltration, retention, and evapotranspiration techniques. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the financial profitability of selected Low Impact Development (LID) methods for decentralized management of rainwater disposed from the roofs of two different buildings. In the presented conditions, the use of dual installations and infiltration tunnels turned out to be cost-effective solutions, whereas infiltration boxes were unprofitable for both buildings. The most unprofitable solution would become profitable if the investment costs were reduced by as much as 67% or if it was possible to generate 2.28 times more benefits. Although the research was carried out for specific conditions, the obtained results may be helpful in the implementation of similar investments. They are also a kind of contribution to the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of LID on a global scale due to the universality of the proposed research methodology.

A Satellite-Based Approach for Quantifying Terrestrial Water Cycle Intensity	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						water cycle intensity; climate change; satellite-based	PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS; RAINFALL; IMERG; TRMM; PERFORMANCE; ERROR; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; REGIMES	The terrestrial water cycle intensity (WCI) is a widely used tool to quantify the impact of climate change on the distribution of global water resources. In this study, a satellite-based WCI was tested by comparing the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) precipitation estimates with those of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite mission across the contiguous United States (CONUS), based on an existing Koppen-Geiger climate classification for the CONUS. Both precipitation products were not statistically different across all climate classes. Consequently, satellite-based WCI changes between two multiannual periods (2001 to 2009 and 2010 to 2019) were calculated at a 0.1-degree spatial resolution using the GPM and a validated global evapotranspiration dataset. This study showed that: (1) The water cycle is speeding up in many parts of the CONUS, particularly the West, driven by recent increases in both precipitation and evapotranspiration through much of the region. (2) The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may be influencing the WCI of the CONUS by driving precipitation in the west, southeast, and parts of the north, and dryness in the northeast regions. The hydrological impacts of these results cannot be generalized. However, flood and drought risks, water availability and quality issues remain key primary concerns.

This study aimed to comprehensively assess multiple sugarcane agrometeorological disasters with regards to sugarcane yield in SC. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and the heat degree-days were employed to characterize drought, flood, and high temperature (HT) during sugarcane growth stages in three provinces in SC in the period 1970-2020. Moreover, the relationships between sugarcane climatic yield and disaster intensities were investigated. The results indicated that the most recent decade witnessed the most intensive sugarcane agrometeorological disasters; sugarcane drought and HT intensities significantly (p < 0.05) increased in one and two provinces, respectively. Central and western SC was most drought-prone, while eastern SC was most flood-prone; sugarcane HT was concentrated in southwestern SC. The mature stage exhibited the greatest monthly intensities of drought and flood; the most HT-prone growth stage varied with provinces. The relationships between drought/flood intensity and sugarcane climatic yield were significant in seven districts; the yield-reducing effect of sugarcane flood was more obvious than that of drought. In conclusion, this study provides references for agrometeorological disaster risk reduction for sugarcane in SC.

Integrated community-based approaches to urban pluvial flooding research, trends and future directions: A review	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Review						Urban pluvial flooding; Citizen science; Socio; hydrology; Climate change; Resilience	CITIZEN-SCIENCE; SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; CROWDSOURCED DATA; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; HAZARD; INUNDATION; POLICY; AREAS	Urban pluvial flooding (UPF) resulting from localized, intense, rainfall-generated ponding and overland flow causes a range of socio-environmental impacts. UPF is driven by a complex set of interconnected factors, including physical, historical, social, cultural, institutional, and economic conditions. Its impacts are increasing due to both biophysical change (e.g., global warming) and the interactions between the human and physical dimensions of the urban environment (e.g., land-use change). Notwithstanding its complexity and the rather low level of attention it has received in both research and practice, UPF is an issue that needs to be tackled from a compre-hensive perspective. Different integrated approaches such as citizen science and socio-hydrology have tried to address UPF by coupling humans and environmental systems, reflecting the possible outcomes from the interaction between disciplines-albeit not without limitations. This paper presents findings on a review of current integrated community-based approaches to UPF research and discusses how scholars have approached this problem and its management. The limitations of these approaches to fully capture the multi-dimensional nature of UPF are explored in detail, and research gaps are identified. Finally, the paper provides suggestions for future research based on a transdisciplinary, transformative citizen science approach.

Combined with the effects of climate change, changes in land use and cover (LULC) threaten the hydrological cycle of the metropolis. It is, therefore, prudent to examine how the LULC change over time has impacted its watershed and the potential threats that such changes pose. This paper's objective was to investigate and discuss the potential impacts of land development intensity (LDI) on the local hydrology of the metropolis, using remote sensing and GIS. Our results revealed interesting dynamics in the LULC changes in the metropolis that may have immensely affected and continued to impact the local hydrological cycle. Of the overall urban expansion in the metropolis, more than 50% occurred within its main watershed, which covers about only 35% of the entire metropolis. Urban expansion within the watershed occurred at the expense of forest and agricultural lands. The continual LDI increase in the watershed has potential significant hydrological consequences in terms of flooding, groundwater subsidence, and saltwater intrusion. To achieve sustainable water management, it is critical that policy decisions recognize and incorporate the potential impacts of LULC changes to limit future impacts.

This paper presents a method for assessing wave overtopping risk of coastal flood defences subjected to changing operational conditions. The joint probability of hydraulic parameters such as sea water level and significant wave height is investigated using the extreme value analysis approaches taking into account rising sea level in the future. Meanwhile, structural resistance degradation such as the crest level settlement of earth sea dykes is considered in overtopping risk analysis by utilising a state-based stochastic deterioration model. Time-dependent probability of wave overtopping failure is estimated from the associated limit state equation, and the effect of hydraulic parameters and crest level settlement on the risk of overtopping failure is investigated. A risk cost optimised maintenance strategy is then determined by balancing the risk of overtopping failure and the costs for structural maintenances. The results for the numerical example of a typical earth sea dyke show that the probability of overtopping failure will increase significantly due to changing hydraulic parameters and losing crest level, thus appropriate maintenance will be needed to reduce the risk during the lifecycle.

Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, or heat waves can alter the course and distribution of malaria. This study aims to understand the impact of future climate change on malaria transmission using, for the first time in Senegal, the ICTP's community-based vector-borne disease model, TRIeste (VECTRI). This biological model is a dynamic mathematical model for the study of malaria transmission that considers the impact of climate and population variability. A new approach for VECTRI input parameters was also used. A bias correction technique, the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, was applied to climate simulations to remove systematic biases in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) that could alter impact predictions. Beforehand, we use reference data for validation such as CPC global unified gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation (CPC for Climate Prediction Center), ERA5-land reanalysis, Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), and African Rainfall Climatology 2.0 (ARC2). The results were analyzed for two CMIP5 scenarios for the different time periods: assessment: 1983-2005; near future: 2006-2028; medium term: 2030-2052; and far future: 2077-2099). The validation results show that the models reproduce the annual cycle well. Except for the IPSL-CM5B model, which gives a peak in August, all the other models (ACCESS1-3, CanESM2, CSIRO, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, inmcm4, and IPSL-CM5B) agree with the validation data on a maximum peak in September with a period of strong transmission in August-October. With spatial variation, the CMIP5 model simulations show more of a difference in the number of malaria cases between the south and the north. Malaria transmission is much higher in the south than in the north. However, the results predicted by the models on the occurrence of malaria by 2100 show differences between the RCP8.5 scenario, considered a high emission scenario, and the RCP4.5 scenario, considered an intermediate mitigation scenario. The CanESM2, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, inmcm4, and IPSL-CM5B models predict decreases with the RCP4.5 scenario. However, ACCESS1-3, CSIRO, NRCM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, and GFDL-ESM2M predict increases in malaria under all scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The projected decrease in malaria in the future with these models is much more visible in the RCP8.5 scenario. The results of this study are of paramount importance in the climate-health field. These results will assist in decision-making and will allow for the establishment of preventive surveillance systems for local climate-sensitive diseases, including malaria, in the targeted regions of Senegal.

This study assesses the performance of RTC to mitigate impacts of climate change on urban flooding resilience. A simulated, yet realistic, urban drainage system in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, shows that RTC improves the flooding resilience by up to 17% under climatic rainfall changes. Compared with green stormwater infrastructure (GSI), RTC exhibits a lower resistibility, lower flooding failure level, and higher recovery rate in system performance curves. Results articulate that keeping RTC's performance consistent under 'back-to-back' storms requires a tradeoff between upstream dynamical operation and downstream flooding functionality loss. This research suggests that RTC provides a path towards smart and resilient stormwater management strategy.

Tropical cyclone-induced coastal acidification in Galveston Bay, Texas	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							SEAWATER; ALKALINITY; CARBON; SHELF; WATER; REEF; CO2	Intense rainfall from tropical cyclones has the potential to induce coastal acidification, which will become more common and severe as climate change continues. We collected carbonate chemistry samples from Galveston Bay, Texas before and after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and 2018. Here, we show ecosystem level acidification and calcium carbonate undersaturation in Galveston Bay following the storm. This acidification event, driven by extreme rainfall from Harvey, persisted for over 3 weeks because of prolonged flood mitigation reservoir releases that continued for over a month after the storm. In addition, the large volume of stormwater led to high oyster mortality rates in Galveston Bay and acidification may have impeded recovery of these vital reefs. It is also likely that undersaturation has occurred outside of our study, unrecorded, following other high-rainfall storms. The projected increase in tropical cyclone rainfall under climate change may thus represent a significant threat to coastal calcifying ecosystems. Extreme precipitation over the coastal Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Harvey led to calcium carbonate undersaturation and ecosystem-level acidification, according to observational analyses from Galveston Bay, Texas, in 2017 and 2018.

Yet, current knowledge on this issue is limited. Here, focusing on an urban agglomeration in the tropics, Singapore, we reveal that future global warming enhances both frequency and intensity of EP, based on simulations with a state-of-the-art convection-permitting regional climate model. EP intensification can reach maximum "super" Clausius-Clapeyron rate (>= $\ge $+7% per K warming) rate, implying a "new normal" of "extreme events get more extreme," which is consistently for both Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 and 4.5. The intensification is lower for moderate and light precipitation. Also, global warming was found to dampen the urban effect on EP events. The EP enhancement is attributed to the increased atmospheric moisture and convective inhibition due to enhanced low-level stratification that delays a convection to develop until it becomes more intense.

Previous research has shown the improved representation of precipitation in convection-permitting models (CPMs), but until now it has not been possible to quantify uncertainties in future changes at convective (<5 km) scales. Here we analyze the first-ever ensemble of convection-permitting climate projections run within the UK Climate Projections project. We find that the CPM ensemble shows a significantly stronger intensification of summer hourly precipitation compared to the driving 12 km ensemble, with increases above the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and natural variability dominating the ensemble spread for extremes. Results suggest that the climate change signal across different CPMs may converge thanks to the more realistic representation of the local storm dynamics. We conclude that CPMs offer the promise of reducing uncertainties for extreme summer precipitation projections due to the better and explicit representation of convection.

However, little is known about how learning contributes to improving their capacity in adapting to these "wicked" problems. This study investigates potential effects of farmers' learning on their adaptive capacity, utilizing nine focus group discussions, 33 interviews, and a structured survey of 300 farmers. The exploratory factor analysis produced two factors for social learning: (1) learning through social interactions and (2) self-reflection, and one factor for adaptive capacity. The regression results show that the social learning factors have significantly positive effects on adaptive capacity. Farmers with a higher level of social learning are likely to demonstrate higher adaptive capacity. The findings call for policy considerations to promote learning in a broader context of the delta to enhance local capacity.

These climate change-related environmental factors and the response of humans at the individual and collective level will affect the mobilization and transport of and human exposure to chemical pollutants in the envi-ronment. We conducted a literature review of possible future impacts of global change in response to a changing climate on chemical pollutants in the environment and human exposure, with a focus on drivers of change in exposure of the Swedish population to chemicals in the indoor and outdoor environment. Based on the literature review, we formulated three alternative exposure scenarios that are inspired by three of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We then con-ducted scenario-based exposure modelling of the >3000 organic chemicals in the USEtox (R) 2.0 chemical library, and fur-ther selected three chemicals (terbuthylazine, benzo[a]pyrene, PCB-155) from the USEtox library that are archetypical pollutants of drinking water and food as illustrative examples. We focus our modelling on changes in the population intake fraction of chemicals, which is calculated as the fraction of a chemical emitted to the environment that is ingested via food uptake or inhaled by the Swedish population. Our results demonstrate that changes of intake fractions of chemicals are possible by up to twofold increases or decreases under different development scenarios. Changes in intake fraction in the most optimistic SSP1 scenario are mostly attributable to a shift by the population towards a more plant-based diet, while changes in the pessimistic SSP5 scenario are driven by environmental changes such as rain fall and runoff rates.

Coping with climate change requires a better awareness of the possible impacts to inform climate adaptation strategies. In this study, we investigated the climate projections from two contrasting GCMs (wet scenario from MIROC5 and dry scenario from CSIRO) and quantified the possible outcomes in terms of hydrological components of the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB). These two climate projection scenarios show that the overall precipitation change in the early (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070), and late century (2071-2100) over the UBNB may vary from -18.3 % to + 13.6 % of the baseline annual precipitation of 1350 mm. The hydrological simulations over the basin from our study showed that evapotranspiration may vary between -13.7 % and + 12.1 % of the average annual total actual ET of 710 mm, and the flow at the basin outlet may range between -40.7 % and + 30.8 % of the mean annual total flow volume of 45 billion cubic meters. As a result, the wet projection exhibited more frequent floods while the dry projection showed severe droughts, specifically in the late century. We also examined the role of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), designed for hydropower generation, in moderating these potential future climate hydrological extremes. Our findings indicate that GERD operations can help reduce downstream flood and drought severity by managing flow releases. Thus, this study illustrates the most possible extreme hydrological events in the UBNB due to climate change and demonstrates the degree to which GERD operations can help reduce the impact of these extremes downstream. The findings and data generated in this study will aid understanding the importance of sustainable water management and reservoir operation that caters to both hydropower generation, and recurring floods and droughts.

Climate change, specifically alterations to precipitation patterns, may have outsized effects on these forests. In Tennessee, USA, precipitation has increased by 15% since 1960. The goal of our research was to assess the evidence for whether this change in precipitation patterns resulted in shorter growing seasons and recruitment failure in common canopy trees for a forest wetland. In 2001 and 2018, the density of Quercus lyrata (overcup oak), Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum), Quercus phellos (willow oak), and Betula nigra (river birch) seedling, sapling and adult density were mapped in an area of 2.3 ha within a seasonally flooded karst depression. Overall, the percentage of the growing season experiencing inundation was 26% greater in the deep than in shallow areas between 2001 and 2018. Saplings and small adults of all four species were restricted to shallow areas, and their abundance has declined substantially. Overcup oak and sweetgum individuals that were recruited into the adult life history stage were repelled from the deep zone. Overcup oak and sweetgum adults experienced lower mortality across the 2.3-ha study area (11% and 26%, respectively) relative to willow oak (56%) and river birch (64%) over the 17-year study. Growing-season inundation showed no relation to mortality in adult sweetgum and willow oak, a positive relation to mortality among adult river birch across size classes and among small adult overcup oak, and an inverse relation to mortality among large adult overcup oak. In shallow regions, overcup oak and sweetgum adults had greater basal area increment relative to the intermediate and deep regions of the pond. Results of hydrologic modeling for the study area, based on rainfall and temperature records covering 1855-2019, show ponding durations after 1970 considerably longer than the historical baseline, across ponding-depth classes. Our results strongly suggest that climate change is a driving factor suppressing tree regeneration since 1970 in this seasonally flooded karst depression.

Methodology for holistic assessment of grey-green flood mitigation measures for climate change adaptation in urban basins	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Future IDF curves; Climate variability adaptation index (CVAI); Storm water management model (SWMM); Ecosystem services; Global sensitivity analysis; Forward uncertainty propagation	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; WATER AVAILABILITY; IDF CURVES; RAINFALL; MODEL; URBANIZATION; DRAINAGE; TRENDS; RISK; NONSTATIONARITY	A novel methodological framework for urban drainage adaptation to climate change is introduced and tested in a small urban basin. The impact of climate change on Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves and on urban drainage is reported. The flood mitigation measures comprised both green and grey alternatives, i.e., permeable surfaces and sewer enlargement. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) was calibrated and employed. Prior to calibration, sensitivity analysis of SWMM hydrologic-hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted using a global sensitivity analysis method. Two novel indices, the Index for Reliability of Urban Drainage Adaptation (IRUDA) and the Climate Variability Adaptation Index (CVAI), were also introduced. IRUDA assesses the total reliability of an urban drainage network in hydraulic, temporal and volumetric terms. Sizing of flood mitigation measures was undertaken employing construction cost along with IRUDA. CVAI was used for alternative selection among different flood mitigation scenarios. CVAI assesses the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network based on hydrological, hydraulic and economic aspects of the proposed adaptation plan. A forward uncertainty propagation scheme was employed on the selected alternative in order to examine input data and parametric uncertainty with respect to the peak discharge at the outlet of the basin. Finally, monetization of ecosystem services offered by green measures is presented. The simulation results for the study area illustrated that under the non-stationarity assumption future rainfall intensities and urban flooding risk will increase, and therefore, further flood mitigation measures will be required. Furthermore, the majority of the adaptation strategies examined were found to improve the capacity and reliability of the drainage network. Moreover, the results revealed that permeable pavements perform better for storm events with return period of up to five years. Overall, it can be concluded that design criteria need to be reviewed and also green measures, such as permeable surfaces, can be introduced in the design procedure.

During this period the area was significantly affected by changes in sea level, climate and vegetation, resulting in a dynamic and complex environmental history, however little research has concentrated on environmental change and human impacts during the last few millennia. This study focuses on this late period, presenting the results of integrated sedimentary, microfossil and radiocarbon analyses from a core near the eastern margin of Lake Dianshan, to the east of Taihu. After the withdrawal of intertidal conditions and the conversion to freshwater lake at the core site about 2600 cal. yr BP, pollen and algal spore data show that increased sedimentation gradually reduced freshwater depth until a surface peat formed ca. 1500 cal. yr BP. This also dates the start of a switch in woodlands from sub-tropical and warm temperate trees to a mainly cool temperate and coniferous tree flora, under climatic cooling and human impact. After this time water depths at the site increased greatly, partly due to climate change and flooding, but also because of the establishment of deepwater 'paddy' agriculture. Microcharcoal and pollen data show that a major episode of human impact using fire, with deforestation and rice cultivation, occurred between ca. 1500 and 1200 cal. yr BP. These dates suggest it is one of the latest examples of 'flooded-field"paddy' cultivation before more intensive agricultural techniques were adopted in the area after ca. 800 cal. yr BP.

In recent decades, climate changes affected by various factors especially human activities have had various impacts in different sections such as melting glaciers, various flood occurrence, occurrence of different droughts and etc. UNEP aridity Index (UNEP) and Modified De-Martonne index (MDM) are two more used indices to evaluate climate conditions in various regions of the world. In this paper; 1) the temporal trend of changes in climate conditions based on UNEP and MDM indices using climatological data (from 1967 to 2017) of 16 meteorological stations using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were evaluated 2) the accuracy of UNEP and MDM indices were compared to assess climate conditions, based on the correlation between mentioned indices and percent of annual yield loss (AYL) in rain-fed winter wheat using simple and multiple Generalizes Estimation Equation (GEE) methods (for help managers to select more suitable and more accurate index to assess climate condition). Results showed, based on UNEP and MDM indices, climate indices in 93.75% and 87.5% of stations had a decreasing trend, but decreasing trend only in 56.25% and 50% of stations were significant at 5% level (respectively). The evaluation of the accuracy of UNEP and MDM indices showed that, in all stations, vertical bar B vertical bar coefficients between calculated AYL and UNEP and MDM indices and R-2 coefficients between simulated AYL using AquaCrop model and predicted AYL using simple and multiple GEE methods in UNEP aridity index were more than MDM index. So, it is recommended to use UNEP aridity index to assess the climate conditions in different regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper implements a multivariate analysis, including conditioning and triggering factors to develop flood susceptibility mapping in an information-deprived region to help prevent/mitigate flooding. Flood-susceptible areas were identified using the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology, specifically, with the hierarchy analysis process (AHP). Four conditioning and one triggering influence factors were analyzed. The influence weights of each variable were determined using Saaty's methodology (AHP). Thematic maps for each variable were created and multiplied by their influence value using the raster calculator and added to their variable group to obtain the flood susceptibility map. The findings showed that the susceptibility to flooding was very high in 41.82%, high in 35.95%, medium in 21.25% and low in 0.98% of the study areas. It was revealed that 44.44% of the localities occupy areas of very high susceptibility to flooding. Susceptibility increases in the localities closest to the river.

Therefore, it is critical to consider a system's ability to prepare, react, and recover from a failure (i.e., resilience) in urban drainage network design. This study proposes a resilience-constrained optimal design model of urban drainage networks that minimizes total system cost while satisfying predefined levels of failure depth and duration. Failure (e.g., flooding) depth refers to the level of system performance degradation, whereas failure duration is the time taken for a system's recovery to its normal state. Optimal layout and pipe sizes are identified by the proposed model comprising the harmony search algorithm for optimization and the storm water management model (SWMM) for dynamic hydrology-hydraulic simulations. The proposed model is demonstrated through the design of two grid networks and an A-city drainage network. The obtained resilience-based design is compared to the least-cost design obtained with no resilience consideration according to optimized layout and pipe sizes and the resulting topological characteristics.

Today, the identification of coastal vulnerabilities worldwide is necessary to prevent impacts and drive action. The aim of the work was to estimate the vulnerable areas from a total rate of increase in sea level of 2.8 m and to identify the impacts of greater magnitude through the use of hierarchical analysis. The analytic hierarchy process method was used to list the most serious impacts. In addition, the simulation of the most vulnerable sites was carried out in a GIS environment using geoprocessing and a digital terrain model for the area of study. The Ilha Grande Bay region (southeastern Brazil) was chosen as a test area due to its economic, tourist and environmental importance. The main impacts are floods, coastal erosion and loss of coastal ecosystems. The most vulnerable areas are characterized as flat with low slopes, usually coastal plains occupied by environmental protection areas, urban centers and historical centers. The methodology proved to be effective in assessing and forecasting vulnerable areas and can be applied to several types of coastal areas.

Large-scale loss of wetlands, combined with more intensive precipitation under changing climate, increases flood risks, to which closed watersheds are particularly susceptible. In the Devils Lake (North Dakota, USA) watershed, a prolonged wet condition since early 1990s has caused a nearly 10 m rise in water level, resulting in over $1 billion losses. While studies have shown the changing climate is the major driver of this flooding, it is still unclear how much contribution could be due to the historical conversion of wetlands in the upper basin. We developed a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Devils Lake watershed and simulated various scenarios representing present and possible past and future wetland area. We estimated the changes in flood risks under the historical and CMIP-5 future climates with these wetland scenarios. We found that while currently wetland restoration does not significantly change flood risks, under the modified climate it presents a good complementary measure reducing the negative impacts of current flood management strategies.

J	Raikes, J; Smith, TF; Baldwin, C; Henstra, D				Raikes, Jonathan; Smith, Timothy F.; Baldwin, Claudia; Henstra, Daniel			Disaster risk reduction and climate policy implementation challenges in Canada and Australia	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; climate risk management; policy implementation; flood risk management; drought risk management	CHANGE ADAPTATION; CHANGING CLIMATE; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; COMMUNITIES; MITIGATION; POLITICS; DROUGHT	Disaster risk reduction is central to managing the risks of climate change at global, national, and sub-national levels. The operationalization of disaster risk reduction, however, has been met with challenges that have restricted successful policy implementation. Drawing from document analyses and Delphi studies with government practitioners, this article examines the policy context for disaster risk reduction in Canada and Australia and investigates the state of flood and drought planning and preparedness. Results are organized around two central themes: risk (ownership and sensitivity) and engagement (stakeholder involvement and capacity-building). The findings show that public policies on disaster risk reduction in Canada and Australia reflect international discourse that advocates for a whole-of-society, risk-sensitive, and risk-informed approach. However, implementing this approach in household planning and preparedness, cross-sector planning and policy integration, terminology, and socio-cultural representation, has been hampered by several factors. Government practitioners in both countries argued that while disaster risk reduction and climate risk management continue to evolve in multi-level governance, policy implementation is constrained by the legacies of past governance arrangements that have enabled disaster risk creation and accumulation. The results presented herein suggest a need for institutional reform that better reflects the holistic and systemic relationships between disaster risk, climate change, and other policy problems. We argue that disaster risk reduction and climate risk management policies require bridging governance arrangements between these and related policy domains to foster effective multi-level implementation. Key policy insights Implementing disaster risk reduction has been inconsistent, exacerbating exposure to climate change and increasing socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster impacts. Managing climate and disaster risk requires a holistic approach that targets vulnerable groups, tackles underlying drivers of risk, and builds capacities to support disaster risk reduction. Although disaster risk reduction and climate risk management policies continue to evolve, implementation is hindered by legacy governance arrangements that favour economic growth over sustainable, climate-sensitive disaster risk management. Transformation through the integration of disaster risk reduction and human development offers potential pathways to reduce vulnerabilities via a holistic disaster risk and climate policy approach.

Considering this issue, this article developed a quantitative method for the regional river-blocking hazard assessment of debris flows by analyzing the in-depth relations among river-blocking hazard formation processes, factors and evolution mechanisms. Taking the debris flows in the Parlung Zangbo Basin in China as a case study, a multidimensional analysis was performed to analyze the characteristics of the hazard sequence and its relationship with climate change, including changes in temperature and precipitation. Accordingly, a new step toward a more comprehensive hazard assessment is proposed by establishing both a model and a system for regional river-blocking hazard assessment to analyze the debris flow evolution processes and environmental dynamics. Specifically, the sources of loose material were quantitatively estimated by establishing mathematical models based on the geometrical characteristics of diverse moraines, and the debris flow runoff was scientifically determined by focusing on the analysis of moraine sources, the brittleness index of the sediment mass and the geomorphological connectivity. Next, through coupling with the hydrodynamic conditions of debris flows and river flows, methods were established to determine the blocking degree of debris flow hazards at the regional scale. Validated by a field study and a remote-sensing interpretation of actual debris flows, a debris-flow induced river-blocking hazard map was obtained, and the assessment results were in accordance with the actual disaster situation. The analysis shows that the distribution of zones with high to very high levels of river blocking is closely correlated with the topographic characteristics and actual disaster sequences of debris flows. These findings suggest that the assessment results provide scientific support for engineering planning and hazard prevention in climate-sensitive areas; thus, the presented method may serve as pertinent guidance for regional river-blocking hazard assessments of debris flows in the Padung Zangbo Basin and beyond.

Natural features determine heat, floods and wildfires. Social features determine vulnerability and resilience. This study examined multidimensional hazards, vulnerabilities, and resilience in Haifa, a socially diverse Mediterranean city. Spatial indices of heatwaves, floods, wildfires and social vulnerability were developed by Geographic Information Systems geoprocessing functions using Digital Elevation Model, land use and welfare data. An online survey assessing risk perceptions, sense of danger and community resilience was distributed to residents (N = 549), and geocoded using street identification. The results show that climate hazards and vulnerabilities vary within the city and reflect its geographical and social characteristics: lower regions are prone to heat and floods and elevated neighborhoods to wildfires. All zones and segments of the population are in certain danger, but climate hazards and vulnerabilities are heterogeneous and unequally distributed, with certain neighborhoods more exposed. The downtown area is most vulnerable in social features, yet its residents have higher resilience perceptions compared to uptown, where the main hazard is wildfires and the main vulnerability is aging. Implications for urban climate policy: local stressors should be mitigated at the neighborhood level by investing in suitable infrastructure and fostering community resilience.

Most methods for glacial lake extraction are based on either optical images or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Although deep learning methods can extract features of optical and SAR images well, efficiently fusing two modality features for glacial lake extraction with high accuracy is challenging. In this study, to make full use of the spectral characteristics of optical images and the geometric characteristics of SAR images, we propose an atrous convolution fusion network (ACFNet) to extract glacial lakes based on Landsat 8 optical images and Sentinel-1 SAR images. ACFNet adequately fuses high-level features of optical and SAR data in different receptive fields using atrous convolution. Compared with four fusion models in which data fusion occurs at the input, encoder, decoder, and output stages, two classical semantic segmentation models (SegNet and DeepLabV3+), and a recently proposed model based on U-Net, our model achieves the best results with an intersection-over-union of 0.8278. The experiments show that fully extracting the characteristics of optical and SAR data and appropriately fusing them are vital steps in a network's performance of glacial lake extraction.

MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; dryland river; egg bank; environmental cues	FLOW VARIABILITY; ZOOPLANKTON; EMERGENCE; IMPACTS; EGGS; COMMUNITIES; SALINITY; DYNAMICS; SUPPRESS; DORMANCY	Microcrustacea in ephemeral wetlands produce dormant eggs to escape prolonged dry conditions. These eggs can hatch on inundation, although in most cases not all eggs hatch during a single wetting event. Incomplete hatching can reflect bet-hedging strategies, but also the presence or absence of environmental cues that stimulate hatching. This study examines the effects of environmental cues likely to change for wetlands in the future, namely, temperature and water depth. Surface sediments collected from dry anabranches of the Macintyre River floodplain (eastern Australia) were inundated under two temperature regimes (warm and cool) in microcosms of two depths (shallow and deep). Hatched microcrustacea were sampled for 6 weeks. The abundance and assemblage composition of microcrustacea varied by temperature but not by depth. Although the total abundance was greater under warm conditions, the effect of temperature diminished over time. Temperature also had a greater effect on non-ostracods, with 144% more non-ostracods being hatched under warm than under cool conditions. Thus, changes to temperature during inundation periods arising from global climate change or river regulation are likely to influence the abundance and composition of microcrustacean assemblages, especially among non-ostracods, which will influence food availability for larval and juvenile native fish and, hence, recruitment.

It is the fourth Italian largest lake and is one of the largest endorheic basins in western Europe. Because of its shallow depth and the absence of natural outflows, the lake, in historical times, alternated from periods of floods to strong decreases of the water level during periods of prolonged drought. Lake water is characterised by a NaCl composition and relatively high salinity. The geochemical and isotopic monitoring of lake water from 2006 to 2018 shows the presence of well-defined seasonal trends, strictly correlated to precipitation regime and evaporation. These trends are clearly highlighted by the isotopic composition of lake water (delta O-18 and delta D) and by the variations of dissolved mobile species. In the long term, a progressive warming of lake water and a strong increase of total dissolved inorganic solids have been observed, indicating Lake Trasimeno as a paradigmatic example of how climate change can cause large variations of water quality and quantity. Furthermore, the rate of variation of lake water temperature is very close to the rate of variation of land-surface air temperature, LSAT, suggesting that shallow endorheic lakes can be used as a proxy for global warming measurements.

J	Sinclair, K				Sinclair, Katie			Water, Water Everywhere, Communities on the Brink: Retreat as a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in the Face of Floods, Hurricanes, and Rising Seas	ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY			English	Article							MISSISSIPPI RIVER	In the nearly fifteen years after Hurricane Katrina, hurricane victims' efforts to recover for the Army Corps of Engineers' construction and maintenance of New Orleans's faulty levee systems have slowly wended their way through the courts. After the Federal Circuit held in St. Bernard Parish Government v. United States that the Army Corps of Engineers' construction and maintenance did not constitute a taking, hurricane victims' efforts to recover in the courts hit a dead end. Using Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath as a lens to examine mechanisms to compensate victims and deter future losses, this Note ultimately concludes that the existing methods of recovery after natural disasters, primarily tort and the National Flood Insurance Program, fall short. As climate change increases the threat of catastrophic flooding caused by hurricanes and rising seas, a new mechanism to compensate victims and deter future flood losses is needed. This Note uses takings, a theory rejected by the Federal Circuit in St. Bernard Parish, as a potential mechanism to facilitate retreat from vulnerable areas by buying back flood-prone properties. However, any federal buyback program must grapple with the problematic history of using eminent domain to forcibly displace poor and minority communities. This Note proposes a program to incorporate community input at an early stage in order to keep valuable community ties intact.

Multi-scalar interactions between mismanaged plastic waste and urban flooding in an era of climate change and rapid urbanization	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						floods; interactions; plastic pollution; social-ecological; waste management	SOLID-WASTE; JUSTICE	Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) and urban flooding are typically considered distinct environmental challenges. However, there are notable links between growing quantities of MPW and the rising incidence of floods in cities. A majority of people now live in cities, especially along coastlines and in estuaries where residents are both vulnerable to flooding and significant sources of plastic waste. Predicted increases in the frequency and severity of heavy rainfall associated with anthropogenic climate change coincide with rising global quantities of MPW, much of which is discharged into water bodies and the sea. Given the urgent and expanding nature of these issues, understanding impacts of urban floods on solid waste management and vice versa is crucial. Social-ecological systems (SES) thinking calls for a holistic approach to the relationships and interactions between human actors and environmental systems which can result in dynamic and emergent outcomes. In this review paper, we make a first step towards better understanding of the interactions between urban flooding and MPW by synthesizing emerging quantitative and qualitative research on particular aspects of such interactions. More research is needed which explicitly focuses on and elaborates the nature of these interactions, and also to consider potential relations across scales (from global to local) and over both long and short timeframes. We conclude that an SES approach can make visible novel possibilities for interventions which are context specific and sensitive to the interactions between urban floods and MPW.This article is categorized under:Science of Water > Water and Environmental ChangeHuman Water > Water GovernanceEngineering Water > Planning Water	[MacAfee, Elizabeth A.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Social Sci, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Lohr, Ansje J.] Open Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Heerlen, Netherlands	Radboud University Nijmegen; Open University Netherlands	MacAfee, EA (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Fac Social Sci, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Nijmegen, Netherlands.	elizabeth.macafee@ru.nl		MacAfee, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9062-8357; Lohr, Ansje/0000-0001-5093-9401	Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)	Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))	The authors gratefully acknowledge Vivian Rompelberg and Wika Maulany Fatima for their assistance creating the figures used in this paper.

A CASE STUDY OF THE SOUTH MORAVA RIVER (SERBIA)	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						river discharge; time-series methods; spectral analysis; cyclicality; South Morava River; Serbia	SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAMFLOW; AUTOCORRELATION; REGION; TRENDS; LAKE	Water scarcity, unequal access to water resources, and the impact of climate change on water availability are among the major global environmental concerns. As dynamic and vulnerable water subjects, rivers are constantly exposed to the pressure of natural conditions variability (primarily climatic) and direct anthropogenic influences. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate river regime dynamics over longer periods to adapt the water management sector, and human demands to any observed variations in river discharge. Observing the periodicity or cyclicity of the occurrence of certain discharge values is an important topic of modern physical geography and hydrology research. Statistics and hydrologic modelling provide great opportunities for observing cyclicality and forecasting future trends. The aim of this paper is to indicate the importance of specific statistical methods of autocorrelation and spectral analysis to study the repeatability of mean annual and maximum discharges. The South Morava River in Serbia (HS: Mojsinje, Korvingrad, Grdelica) has been selected as a case study. The obtained results (period: 1924-2021) indicated the significant cyclicity of mean annual discharges, especially pronounced at the upstream hydrological station Grdelica (3.5-year cycle) and downstream hydrological station Mojsinje (19.5-year cycle). These cyclicities are mostly influenced by variations in the amount of precipitation received from the upper part of the river basin (R > 0.6). In contrast, no regular cycles of maximum annual discharge values were determined in the studied period. The obtained results can be important for future detailed geographic and hydrologic studies as well as for the development of strategies and plans in the field of water management, environmental protection, spatial planning, prevention of floods and droughts, etc.	[Langovic, Marko; Zivkovic, Nenad; Dragicevic, Slavoljub; Lukovic, Jelena] Univ Belgrade, Fac Geog, Studentski trg 3-3, Belgrade, Serbia	University of Belgrade	Langovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Geog, Studentski trg 3-3, Belgrade, Serbia.	marko.langovic@gef.bg.ac.rs	Dragicevic, Slavoljub/K-8986-2017; Langović, Marko/KCX-9362-2024	Dragicevic, Slavoljub/0000-0002-1417-5405; 	Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia [451-03-47/2023-01/20009]	Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia	Acknowledgment Supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia, No. 451-03-47/2023-01/20009.		61	0	0	1	1	Carpathian Assoc Environment and Earth Sciences	Baia Mare	Victoriei 47A, Baia Mare, ROMANIA	1842-4090	1844-489X		CARPATH J EARTH ENV	Carpath.

In this study, we aimed to tease apart the influence of tourism from that of climate in a mountain lake located within one of the largest French ski resorts, by combining paleolimnological and present ecological data. The reconstructed long-term ecological dynamics highlighted an increase in lake biological production from the end of the Little Ice Age up to the 1950s, suggesting a historical dominance of climate control. Afterward, a major drop in pelagic production occurred at the same time as the watershed erosion increased and peaked in the 1990s, concomitant with massive digging for the ski resort expansion. The benthic invertebrates collapsed in the 1980s, concomitantly with the onset of massive salmonid stocking and recent warming. Stable isotope analyses identified benthic invertebrates as the major salmonid diet resource and suggested a possible direct impact of salmonid stocking on benthic invertebrates. However, habitat use may differ among salmonid species as suggested by the way fish DNA was preserved in surficial sediment. The high abundances of macrozooplankton further confirmed the limited reliance of salmonids on pelagic resources. The variable thermal tolerance of benthic invertebrates suggested that the recent warming may mostly affect littoral habitats. Our results indicate that winter and summer tourism may differently affect the biodiversity of mountain lakes and could collectively interfere with the ecological impacts of recent warming, making local management of primary importance to preserve their ecological integrity.

This study uses different cumulus and microphysics schemes in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate heavy rainfall events and Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh, where many extreme events occur. Results show that WRF can capture the cyclone track, intensity, and landfall position. In addition, regionalization and an ensemble method through Bayesian regression model (BRM) are used to improve WRF rainfall simulations. Although regionalization can improve results of the experiments with different schemes, BRM leads to the best performance. To consider uncertainties and evaluate hazards, a probabilistic framework and proper indices based on distributions are used. Spatiotemporal precipitation distributions are used to develop the flash flood index (FFI) to compare the intensity of heavy rainfall events. Results show a large FFI over the central and southeast divisions that indicates the areas prone to the flash flood hazards and high-level risk. We use standardized precipitation index (SPI) in 6- and 12-month time scales based on monthly precipitation of ACCESS-CM2 in 2015-2100 under two scenarios (SSP-126 and 585) to evaluate long-term precipitation changes and drought/flood tendency. In addition, the probability distributions of the precipitation and wind speed are used in reliability analysis of the infrastructure. Target reliability indices determine the proper design rainfall (105 mm d(-1)) and wind speed (60 m s(-1)) that leads to a safe design of infrastructure. This study provides an integrated analysis of extreme hydrometeorological events, which is crucial for sustainable adaptation and mitigation plans.

However, changes in glaciers and glacial lakes are rarely documented in the Eastern Himalayan region, especially from Bhutan and Arunachal Himalaya. This study attempts to bridge the knowledge gap on depletion of glaciers and glacial lake changes in the Eastern Himalayas by concentrating on the Mago Chu basin. Spatio-temporal changes in the glaciers and lakes extent and number in 1988 and 2018 are derived from Landsat TM and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries and major climatic drivers of change (temperature and precipitation) are analyzed from ERAS reanalysis data. The number of glaciers was reduced from 92 to 86 during 1988-2018, whereas the glacial lakes increased from 134 to 195 in this period. The glacial area of 83.55 (+/- 6.2) km(2), which contributed to almost 10% of the total basin area in 1988, shrank to about 58.7 (+/- 1.6) km(2) covering only 7% of the total basin area in 2018. Twenty smaller glaciers vanished, 12 fragmented, and 57 have retreated. Glacial lake area, on the other hand, increased from similar to 3.8 (+/- 1.2) km(2) in 1988 to similar to 6.4 (+/- 0.0006) km(2) in 2018, and 61 new lakes formed during this period. The new lakes are not proglacial but are glacier-fed, indicating retreat of glaciers. Climate data analysis shows increase in mean monthly temperature during the period in the study area supporting the changes observed in glaciers and lakes.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the twenty-first century experienced a severe global mean sea-level rise due to human-induced climate change. Therefore, coastal planners require reasonably accurate estimates of the rate of sea-level rise and the potential impacts, including extreme sea-level changes, floods, and shoreline erosion. Also, land loss as a result of disturbance of shoreline is of interest as it damages properties and infrastructure. Using a nonlinear autoregressive network with an exogenous input (NARX) model, this study attempted to simulate (1991 to 2012) and predict (2013-2020) sea-level change along Merang kechil to Kuala Marang in Terengganu state shoreline areas. The simulation results show a rising trend with a maximum rate of 28.73 mm/year and an average of about 8.81 mm/year. In comparison, the prediction results show a rising sea level with a maximum rate of 79.26 mm/year and an average of about 25.34 mm/year. The database generated from this study can be used to inform shoreline defense strategies adapting to sea-level rise, flood, and erosion. Scientists can forecast sea-level increases beyond 2020 using simulated sea-level data up to 2020 and apply it for future research. The data also helps decision-makers choose measures for vulnerable shoreline settlements to adapt to sea-level rise. Notably, the data will provide essential information for policy development and implementation to facilitate operational decision-making processes for coastal cities.

In southeast Asian countries, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to weather-related events including droughts and floods. This research study aims to determine the farmers' perception towards climatic risks, farmers' choice of adaptation strategies and factors influencing farmers' decision of adaptation measures. A face-to-face household survey was conducted to collect primary data of 378 farm households from three tehsils of district Charsadda-Khyber Pakhuntkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was utilized as an instrument to collect data from the targeted farmers in study areas (three tehsils of district Charsadda). A binary probit model approach was used to assess the major factors affecting farmers' decision towards adaptation measures. Results revealed that changing crop varieties, diversification of crops, changing crop calendar, and insurance of crops were the major adaptive measures exercised by farm households in their farms. Findings of the binary probit approach showed that age of the respondents, farm size, educational level, credit access, household size, extension services access and perception of increased floods, and reduction in precipitation had substantial effect on the farmers' adaptation strategies choice. Advanced agricultural practices in response to the climatic risks can thus have substantial effects and reduction in farmers' exposure to natural calamities. Study findings of our research can guide policy makers and concerned authorities and provide policy implications for future research studies.

This research explores the possibility of using a coupled Geographic Information System and hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) to assess the impact of land use changes on stream flows in the Thac Ba reservoir basin in the Northern Vietnam in three different land use change scenarios: expansion of forest lands, return to the nature, and expansion of the urban area. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies of 0.895 and 0.869 were obtained after the calibration and validation processes, respectively. The nutrient and sediment loadings are currently being assessed pending the acquisition of observed data and model calibration. Further studies will be conducted to have a look at the likely effects of climate changes on the water quality and quantity of the Thac Ba reservoir as well as providing an insight of how the SWAT model for the Thac Ba reservoir basin can be applied to the much larger and nationally more important basin, the HoaBinh reservoir basin which provides drinking water to the capital Hanoi. According to the scenarios of land use change conditions, an increasing trend in stream flow may be expected in the next decades caused by increasing rainfall amounts. Therefore, flooding and the reduced reservoir capacity are major problems in the target area, and there must be improvement of watershed management by applying the Integrated Lake Basin Management concept.

This study aims to control SWI due to the rise in sea levels in three climate regions: (i) humid and wet regions using storage dams at different heads and recharge ponds, (ii) hyper-arid and arid regions using physical barriers and wastewater treatment aquifer, brackish water abstraction, and desalination (TRAD) method, and (iii) semi-arid and semi-humid regions using a combination of flooding water recharge well-field and cut-off wall. The study was developed using the world benchmark problem of Henry's problem and Biscayne aquifer in the Cutler Ridge area near Deering Estate, Florida, USA. The finite-difference code SEAWAT was used in numerical simulations. The numerical results indicated that increasing the artificial recharge lake capacity minimizes the SWI in humid and wet regions with a high level of flooding. Moreover, the intrusion is mitigated using physical barriers and the TRAD method for hyper-arid and arid regions. Combining physical barriers during dry seasons and recharge wells for wet seasons resulted in suitable measures to managed the SWI in semi-arid and semi-humid regions. Finally, the best strategy to mitigate the SWI and minimize the desalination costs depends on the precipitation rates. Therefore, the methodology applied to this study represents a valuable tool in order to select the best method based on the climate conditions and particularly the precipitation intensity to increase the water budget in freshwater aquifers.

This is because scientific study of ES interactions can aid effective planning and management of ESs, thus curtailing degradation and enhancing restoration. In this study, ES interactions of the climate-sensitive West African Sokoto-Rima basin were quantified using land cover and a series of GIS-derived data as inputs into the InVEST model. Crop production (CP), seasonal water yield (SWY), habitat quality (HQ), and nutrient retention ratio (NRR) between 1992 and 2015 were assessed. Climate change assessment was based Mann-Kendall trend of precipitation and temperature for both past (1951-2017) and future (2018-2050) climates. The climate dynamics present a drying-warming trend with localised cooling-warming spells in some locations and a general future wetting-warming trend. Areas dominated by cropland and CP exert significant influence on the spatiotemporal dynamics of ES interactions contributing to the manifestation of substantial trade-offs and synergies across the past (2015) and the future (2050) climates. This also regulates the overbearing pattern of multiple ES interactions such that the relationship CP > SWY > HQ > EVI > NRR was observed over the study area. The persistence of these diverse relationships will stimulate the possible degradation of natural regulating ESs. Improvement of existing crop cultivation clusters, cultivation of flood-resistant crop varieties, and agroforestry expansion were proposed as climate and ESs interaction-based restoration measures. When adopted, these measures will douse the increasing ES pressures within this semi-arid zone.

Three layered landfill cover are designed for areas experiencing very humid climatic conditions. Under the effects of climate change, the occurrences of extreme rainfall events become more frequent and this has resulted in catastrophic floods and hence extreme ponding. This study investigates the seepage characteristics of three-layered capillary barrier cover systems under an extreme ponding condition of 1.5 m water head, through detailed laboratory column tests and finite-element seepage analysis. Four 1.2 m-tall columns having different configurations (C1-C4) were studied. Fly ash (FA) was used to amend the surface and barrier layers in columns C2 and C4, in line with the novel concept of "waste protect waste". Spatiotemporal variations of volumetric water content of the four columns were monitored for three years continuously. With FA amendment in the surface layer and an inclusion of a 0.01 m thick geosynthetic clay liner between the drainage and barrier layers, the onset of basal percolation was significantly delayed until 700 days of ponding, compared to 115 days without FA amendment. Capillary flow dominated the gravitational flowand perchedwater tablewas formed as waterfront advanced fromthe drainage to barrier layers. Further seepage analysis considering a realistic humid climate boundary condition showed that all four configurations were successful in preventing basal percolation for 800 days.

Identifying vulnerable areas and proposing feasible adaptation strategies for future land-use development are particularly important. Using Bay County, Florida, as a case study, this study develops a technical methodology to develop future land-use adaptation strategies in response to SLR and storm surges. We propose a cellular automata (CA) land-use adaptation model that not only minimizes the impacts of SLR and flooding from storm surge events but also captures inherent spatial growth characteristics by integrating a vulnerability assessment with a land suitability analysis. To assess vulnerability, a series of physical, environmental, and socioeconomic indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptation have been developed. In the CA land-use adaptation model, transition rules are generated from an integer programming problem that aims to maximize land-use suitability and to minimize the vulnerability of newly developed land cells. The model is calibrated with actual land-use data from 2000 to 2010. The model validation indicates that the predicted land uses effectively capture direction of spatial growth, with a kappa coefficient of 87.9%. In comparison with the results of a standard land-use development model, in this CA adaptation model successfully projects future developments in low vulnerability areas. This model could effectively help in the development of future land-use adaptation strategies to address the impacts of flooding due to SLR and storm surges.

However, researchers lack a framework that can anticipate how diverse species will respond to weather extremes spanning weeks to months. Here we used high-resolution occurrence data from eBird, a global citizen science initiative, and dynamic species distribution models to examine how 109 North American bird species ranging in migration distance, diet, body size, habitat preference, and prevalence (commonness) respond to extreme heat, drought, and rainfall across a wide range of temporal scales. Across species, temperature influenced species' distributions more than precipitation at weekly and monthly scales, while precipitation was more important at seasonal scales. Phylogenetically controlled multivariate models revealed that migration distance was the most important factor mediating responses to extremely hot or dry weeks; residents and short-distance migrants occurred less often following extreme heat. At monthly or seasonal scales, less common birds experienced decreases in occurrence following drought-like conditions, while widespread species were unaffected. Spatial predictions demonstrated variation in responses to extreme weather across species' ranges, with predicted decreases in occurrence up to 40% in parts of ranges. Our results highlight that extreme weather has variable and potentially strong implications for birds at different time scales, but these responses are mediated by life-history characteristics. As weather once considered extreme occurs more frequently, researchers and managers require a better understanding of how diverse species respond to extreme conditions.

Expected precipitation extremes and drought dynamics from changing sea surface temperature	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH-AMERICA; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; DECADAL VARIABILITY; SUMMER RAINFALL; AMAZON; WETLAND; PACIFIC; IMPACT; ENSO	Climate change poses a critical threat to the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world. Models indicate an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events and extended periods of drought. These changes can amplify consequences for Pantanal's ecological functioning, which has already experienced intensive human modification of its hydrological system and environmental health. The present study analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall and resulting extremes in the Brazilian area of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) along with a co-evaluation of the global Sea Surface Temperature data (SST). The predicted results indicate that wet extreme precipitation events will become more frequent in the highlands, while severe and prolonged droughts triggered by warming SSTs in the Northern Hemisphere (North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans) will affect the Pantanal. The linear relations between precipitation with SST of very specific oceanic regions and even from specific oceanic indexes obtained in the present study significantly improve the forecasting capacity, mainly from a resulting reduction to two months of the lead-time between SST warming to concomitant precipitation impacts, and by explaining 80% of Pantanal's precipitation variation from major oceanic indexes (e.g., ENSO, PDO, NAO, ATL3). Current SST trends will result in inter- and intra-annual flooding dynamic alterations, drastically affecting the Pantanal ecosystem functioning, with consequences for wildlife diversity and distribution. Regarding the foreseeable global climate and land use change scenarios, the results from the present study provide solid evidence that can be used at different decision-making levels (from local to global) for identifying the most appropriate management practices and effectively achieving sustainability of the anthropic activity occurring in the Pantanal.

We systematically characterize the delta's algal flora, addressing the gap left by previous research that was limited to single algal groups (e.g., diatoms) and/or only looking at upstream areas in the Okavango River basin. We analyzed 130 algal samples from 49 upstream and downstream sites with higher and lower flooding frequency, respectively, across a river-to-floodplain habitat gradient. Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta dominated both abundance and taxon richness (>80%) of the total 494 taxa found from 49,158 algal units counted (cells, colonies, coenobia, and filaments). Smaller algae were more abundant in downstream floodplains than in upstream channels and lagoons. Motile and siliceous algae were much more abundant than non-motile, nitrogen fixing, and phagotrophic algae. The frequency of these traits was associated more with flooding frequency than habitat type. The highest algal richness and diversity were found downstream, where shallow floodplain ecosystems with seasonally fluctuating water depths offer greater habitat heterogeneity, and macronutrients are resuspended. The increasing threats from upstream water abstraction plans, fracking, and climate change require enhanced protection and monitoring of the Okavango Delta's natural annual flood-pulse to maintain the high species and functional diversity of this unique wetland's microalgae.

Soumya			Analyzing the streamflow teleconnections of greater Pampa basin, Kerala, India using wavelet coherence	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						Climate change; Streamflow; Climatic oscillations; Wavelet coherence; Teleconnection; Kerala	SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; MULTISCALE; FLOODS; OCEAN; ENSO; ASSOCIATION; TRANSFORM	Climate change is one of the major global threats which affects the streamflow variability. In order to disentangle the relationships between climatic oscillations (COs) and streamflows (SF), this study presents a framework for the identification of main climatic factors integrating Bivariate wavelet coherence (BWC), Multiple wavelet coherence (MWC), and Partial wavelet coherence (PWC) approaches. The application of this method is demonstrated by analysing the monthly SF-CO teleconnections of four stations belonging to the rivers of Greater Pampa region of Kerala, which was severely affected by the 2018 Kerala floods. To investigate the impact of these large-scale climatic patterns on the SF of this region, COs, specifically El Nin & SIM;o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), are taken into consideration. The relationships between different SF-COs are statistically quantified with the help of Average Wavelet Coherence (AWC) and the Percentage of Significant Coherence (PoSC). The BWC analysis showed that the IOD is the dominant predictor for SF1 (AWC = 0.46, PoSC = 26.05%) and SF2 (AWC = 0.5, PoSC = 30.03%) stations while NAO is the dominant predictor for SF3 (AWC = 0.43, PoSC = 18.25%) and SF4 (AWC = 0.48, PoSC = 24.83%) stations. Addition of NAO to the most significant combination of SF-PDO-IOD from the twofactor analysis produced the highest coherence values for all the stations. The PWC analysis indicated a drastic reduction in coherence values with respect to the BWC analysis, indicating a strong interrelationship between different COs and SF.

The type of risk varies by location, with the lives, homes, and livelihoods of residents of India's coastal megacities threatened by coastal floods and storm surges while village-dwellers residing in rural flood plains may additionally lose both crops and livestock. Schools and health facilities throughout the country are also at risk. This multi-scale study employs several datasets, from multiple domains, to generate high-resolution estimates of potential exposure to fluvial and coastal floods for (1) urban and rural populations, (2) health facilities, and (3) educational facilities. Our results, presented at the state level, suggest high exposure to fluvial flooding with about 184 million or more than 1:7 of India's population at risk. This proportion is somewhat higher for rural dwellers (15.8%) compared with urban residents (14.2%). Urban residents, however, are much more likely to be affected by coastal floods, likely due to the high population densities of India's coastal megacities. In total, around 19,218 (15%) of health and 34,519 (18%) of educational facilities are exposed to either coastal or fluvial flood risks. A spatially detailed, locally refined, comprehensive flood risk assessment such as this is critical to inform and target public policy and guide disaster risk reduction plans. By improving infrastructure, increasing awareness, and developing proactive, targeted, and inclusive flood plans, communities can build resilience.

J	Oukes, C; Leendertse, W; Arts, J				Oukes, Casper; Leendertse, Wim; Arts, Jos			Enhancing the Use of Flood Resilient Spatial Planning in Dutch Water Management. <i>A Study of Barriers and Opportunities in Practice</i>	PLANNING THEORY & PRACTICE			English	Article						Flood resilience; water management; adaptation; spatial planning; Multi-Layer Safety	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; CITIES	Around the world, deltaic and coastal regions like the Netherlands are facing challenges from climate, change such as sea-level rise as well as more frequent and extreme natural events. Since 2009, the Dutch government has tried to mitigate flood vulnerability by deploying a balanced mix of flood protection measures, resilient spatial planning and crisis management (MultiLayer Safety). However, recent evaluations have concluded that resilient spatial planning is (too) limitedly applied in practice. This article aims to understand the barriers and opportunities for resilient spatial planning in flood risk management by comparing two cases where resilient spatial planning was opted for: Dordrecht and the Ussel-Vecht Delta. The study suggests a large gap between the wide array of possible measures, and those that are actually realized in practice. Three physical-spatial barriers were identified: maximum flood depths, lack of space, and rigidity of the existing built environment. Additionally, institutional-organizational barriers were found, including: a false, low or non-existent safety perception or risk awareness, and therefore a lack of urgency to act; a lack of political and societal support; a suboptimal collaboration between stakeholders; ambiguity regarding responsibilities; finances and a cost-benefit imbalance; and a lack of human capital. Subsequently, the article explores possibilities to overcome these barriers. Overcoming these barriers can pave pathways for flood resilient spatial planning. The institutional-organizational barriers appear surmountable, whereas the physical-spatial barriers prove to be more problematic and form the most important restrictive factor for resilient spatial planning in flood risk management.

This challenge is elevated in the face of growing evidence of climate change.OBJECTIVE: This work performs a series of policy experiments to discover an affordable set of measures to protect food grain security as well as assure profitability of high valued crops in Bangladesh. METHODS: This work uses primary and secondary data from Bangladesh agriculture to develop an empirical mathematical programming economic optimization model to achieve each of four alternative food policy objectives.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show total economic welfare achievable under each policy objectives: protecting baseline observed farm sector outcomes, minimum protection of food grain security, protection of farm income from producing high value crops, and unconstrained food welfare optimization. The application is to an important farming region of northwest Bangladesh. We find that policymakers can achieve both food grain security and farm income from high value crops at a minimum cost of economic welfare displaced.SIGNIFICANCE: The use of empirical models that describe and predict farm economic optimization behavior can provide guidance in the search for affordable policies for protecting food grain security while protecting farm income in the developing world.

J	Wu, T				Wu, Tao			Quantifying coastal flood vulnerability for climate adaptation policy using principal component analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Coastal flood; Vulnerability indicator; Climate change; Principal component analysis; Adaptation policy	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; COMPOSITE INDEX; INDICATORS; RESILIENCE; DECISION	With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal lowlands are unprecedentedly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts, such as rising sea levels, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding. Quantifying coastal flood vulnerability serves as a tool to identify a system's weakness, monitor its change, and support making targeted climate adaptation policies. The assessment framework proposed in this research uses principal component analysis (PCA) and a weighting method to build a composite indicator of flood vulnerability index and evaluate the vulnerability for 256 coastal census tracts and 24 municipalities along the coast of Connecticut, USA. The research uses Keiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to test sample adequacy and performs data standardization for all indicators. Through PCA, 30 coastal vulnerability-related indicators were grouped into four major dimensions: hazard exposure, socio-economic, physical/land use and land cover, and natural. The findings highlight the variations of flood vulnerability across highly ur-banized areas, suburban areas, and rural areas; and the gradient from coastal low-elevation region to high-elevation inland area. This variance is unevenly caused by different dimensions although they may trade-off with each other when aggregated, the dominant dimensions play a significant or decisive role in the vulnera-bility assessment. This research built an automatic and objective assessment framework that is flexible enough to be applied at a smaller scale so as to obtain detailed analysis and it can be used as a decision-making support system.

The need also emerged to both broaden and update the skills of urban planners and to improve territorial governance tools, with the aim of developing feasible regeneration and resilience strategies to face climate change. In this paper, a methodology for the production of Flood Risk Maps is presented, as applied to the Municipality of Ravenna, Italy, by only considering the static component of inundation hazard, i.e., the projected Mean Sea Level Rise, as a first step towards increased preparedness. The resulting Flood Risk Maps represent, in fact, an innovation with respect to the current cognitive framework that supports local urban planning, by providing information on a potential risk that has so far been overlooked. The method combines sea level rise projections under the pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario with georeferenced territorial data, aiming to identify the physical consistency of the urban-structure components which are potentially at risk. For successive time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2100), our results show the progressive impairment and potential degradation of extensive urban areas that are disregarded in the urban planning regulations currently in force. This preliminary evaluation phase is aimed at prompting and supporting the necessary updating of the planning tools and regulations adopted by the public bodies responsible for territorial governance, by identifying priority areas for intervention, and helping define mitigation and adaptation actions.

However, human systems in particular are dynamic and influenced by multiple drivers and hence identifying an anthropogenic climate signal is challenging. Here we analyze the case of lake Palcacocha in the Andes of Peru, which offers a representative model for other glacier lakes and related risks around the world because it features a dynamic evolution of flood risk driven by physical and socioeconomic factors and processes. Furthermore, it is the object of a prominent climate litigation case, wherein a local Peruvian citizen sued a large German energy producer over risk of flooding from lake Palcacocha. Adopting a conceptual model of cascading impacts and multiple drivers of risk, we first study climatic and other geophysical drivers of flood risk. We find that an anthropogenic signal from flood risk to greenhouse gas emissions is traceable. In parallel, flood risk has been strongly shaped (and increased) by interacting socioeconomic, institutional and cultural processes over the past few decades. The case raises important questions about the differentiation of responsibilities relating to flood risk of both global and local agents, which are, however, difficult to address in cases like Palcacocha, where we reveal a complex network of interlinked global, national and local drivers. Following from this, we outline a normative framework with a differentiated perspective on responsibility, implying that global emitters commit to support strengthening capacities in affected regions and localities and that local institutions and societies engage in local risk reduction measures and policies in collaboration with and driven by local communities.

To limit the evolving risks of urban pluvial flooding in a more environmentally friendly manner, the research community has recently paid increasing attention to Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), which are based on new green technologies. To meet the urgent demand for a comprehensive review of the most recent literature, this review conducts a systematic survey of the literature to characterize various NBS adopted in different regions of the world and to elaborate on the benefits and limitations of such NBS. The review highlights the role of NBS in urban flood risk management under ongoing climate change and rapid urbanization. It shows that NBS could effectively mitigate urban flooding caused by high-frequency precipitation events, with additional economic, ecological, and social benefits. However, NBS are less effective at helping cope with pluvial flooding caused by extreme precipitation events over a short period of time, while gray infrastructures also have limitations as a mitigation measure against extreme pluvial flooding. We thus recommend identifying flood risk management strategies by evaluating the performance of alternative combinations of NBS with gray infrastructures in preventing pluvial flooding in the cities. Finally, recent advances made in the applications of NBS are presented with suggestions (e.g., long-term monitoring) to improve urban flood adaptive management.

Vulnerable populations tend to have greater exposure to flooding as a result of historical societal and institutional processes. Most flood vulnerability studies focus on a single large flood, neglecting the impact of small, frequent floods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate inequitable flood exposure across a range of event magnitudes and frequencies. To explore this question, we develop a novel score of inequitable flood risk by defining risk as a function of frequency, exposure, and vulnerability. This analysis combines high-resolution, parcel-scale compounded fluvial and pluvial flood data with census data at the census block group scale. We focus on six census tracts within Athens-Clarke County, Georgia that are highly developed with diverse populations. We define vulnerable populations as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and households under the poverty level and use dasymetric mapping techniques to calculate the over-representation of these populations in flood zones. Inequitable risks at each census tract (approximately neighborhood scale) were estimated for multiple (e.g., 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year) flood return periods. Results show that the relatively greatest flood risk inequities occur for the 10-year flood and not at the largest event. We also found that the size of inequity is dynamic, depending on the flood magnitude. Therefore, addressing a range of events including smaller, more frequent floods can increase equity and reveal opportunities that may be missed if only one event is considered.

The Impact of Climate Change on Operational Probable Maximum Precipitation Estimates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						probable maximum precipitation (PMP); extreme precipitation; dewpoint; moisture maximization; climate change	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; FLOOD; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY	The safety of high-risk water infrastructure, such as dams and nuclear power plants, is often assessed by reference to their ability to accommodate floods derived from the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP). However, a key shortcoming of traditional PMP estimates is the assumption of a stationary climate, with evidence indicating that key meteorological conditions related to the magnitudes of extreme storms, such as atmospheric moisture, are changing in a warming climate. Due to the pragmatic nature of PMP methods derived for design purposes, inferring potential changes in PMP estimates based solely on trends or projections of atmospheric variables can ignore PMP method complexities and constraints. Here we explore how different traditional PMP methods will respond to a potential increase in atmospheric moisture. We find that increases in persisting dewpoint will lead to increases in PMP estimates, and the nature of this impact depends on whether the moisture maximization step is based on local or transposed regional information. An historical trend analysis reveals annual maximum persisting dewpoint temperatures have increased continuously over Australia over the past 60 years, with further increases predicted over the coming decades for all Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). PMP estimates across Australia are predicated to increase by an average value of 13% by 2100 based on the conservative SSP1-2.6, compared to 33% for SSP5-8.5. We conclude PMP methods will require regular updating to account for changing persisting dewpoints and likely progressive increases in PMP, and the ensuing flood estimates.	[Visser, J.

Understanding how these extremes may change in the future is needed for better planning under climate change. Data on future changes in extreme precipitation over Alaska from dynamically downscaled output of two global climate models (GFDL and CCSM) were employed in this study. Threshold amounts for duration of the precipitation event (1 h, 1 day, and 30 days) and return intervals (2, 10, and 50 years) are evaluated and further downscaled onto NOAA Atlas 14. For each duration and return interval, the models' fractional changes of threshold amounts are applied to the Atlas 14 estimates to remove the model bias. The threshold amounts for nearly all event durations and return intervals are projected to increase from present (1979-2005) amounts to higher values in later decadal periods (2020-49, 2050-79, and 2080-99), and the percentage increases generally exceed the changes in the mean amounts. The percentage increases are comparable in the various geographical regions of Alaska, but the increases in the actual amounts are greatest in the wetter southeast. Although the downscaled GFDL model shows larger increases than the CCSM model in amounts for nearly all durations and return intervals, both models indicate that convective precipitation will become an increasingly greater fraction of the total precipitation during the warm season. The increase in the proportion of convective precipitation is consistent with the more rapid increase in extreme amounts than in mean amounts.

In this study, we reviewed the literature on how conservation practices, both at watershed and field scales, have been proven to subdue flood peaks, surface runoff, soil erosion, sediment transport, and nutrient loss. We classified different conservation practices based on the mode of their application (i.e., in-field, edge-of-field, and structural practices) and described what prior research efforts have concluded about the efficacy of different practices. At the field scale, practices such as reduced or no-till farming, grassed waterways, and creation of wetlands significantly reduced the peak flow. Similarly, water quality was improved with implementation of conservation practices such as using cover crops, filter strips, and managing residue and tillage. The assessment of conservation practices across the literature was found to be challenging as different conservation practices showed a similar response, thus making it complex to assess the individual effect. A wide range of challenges related to the data, modeling/analysis, and management aspects of conservation practices were identified, and recommendations were provided to overcome these challenges.

A range of plausible future climate change scenarios is considered along with narratives for socioeconomic change. We find that with no further adaptation, global EAPA could increase from 34M people/year in 2015 to 246M people/year by 2100. Global EAD could increase from 0.3% of global GDP today to 2.9% by 2100. If, however, coastal defences are increased at a rate which matches the projected increase in extreme sea level, by 2100, the total EAPA is reduced to 119M people/year and the EAD will be reduced by a factor of almost three to 1.1% of GDP. The impacts of such flooding will disproportionately affect the developing world. By 2100, Asia, West Africa and Egypt will be the regions most impacted. If no adaptation actions are taken, many developing nations will experience EAD greater than 5% of GDP, whilst almost all developed nations will experience EAD less than 3% of GDP.

The issue of flood disasters, which particularly impacts SDG 13 of the integrated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), still lacks widespread attention from sociology researchers in Malaysia. Similarly, questions related to the welfare of victims, especially in regards to aspects of disaster management from a humanitarian perspective, are still neglected. This study aims to identify the adaptive actions through a solution from a humanitarian perspective in managing flood disaster risks. For the purpose of obtaining data, this study used a qualitative approach with a case study design. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and non-participant observation methods. A total of ten experts, consisting of the flood management teams involved in managing the 2014 flood disaster in Hulu Dungun, Terengganu, Malaysia, were selected through a purposive random sampling method. The results showed that adaptive actions in managing flood disaster risks from a humanitarian point of view include the provision of social support, collective cooperation from the flood management teams, and adaptation efforts after the floods.

Integrated water management has thus become a necessity and it depends, inter alia, on the effectiveness of the adopted strategies, policies and individual investments. In many countries, including Poland, the implementation of this postulate is slow. The importance of local spatial plans, which are a tool that directly translates adopted policies into spatial development, is underestimated. The article presents studies of the provisions of planning documents with particular emphasis on the local spatial plans regulations in terms of considering the issue of water management. Some municipalities in the Warsaw agglomeration were selected for the detailed research, as the areas characterized by various water conditions. Local spatial plans adopted for this territory were compared to model planning acts from other regions of Europe. The conclusions include recommendations for local spatial plans and a method for assessing planning documents regarding the scope of the sustainable water management arrangements. The study results indicate that the principles of integrated water management have not been fully incorporated into the existing plans in Poland and that national and regional policies are poorly translated into real management planning.

Wave-induced flooding is a complex physical process that requires computationally-expensive numerical models to be reliably estimated, thus limiting its application to single island case studies. Here we present a new model-based parameterisation for wave setup and a set of numerical simulations for the wave-induced flooding in coral reef islands as a function of their morphology, the Manning friction coefficient, wave characteristics and projected mean sea level that can be used for rapid, broad scale (e.g. entire atoll island nations) flood risk assessments. We apply this new approach to the Maldives to compute the increase in wave hazard due to mean sea-level rise, as well as the change in island elevation or coastal protection required to keep wave-induced flooding constant. While future flooding in the Maldives is projected to increase drastically due to sea-level rise, we show that similar impacts in nearby islands can occur decades apart depending on the exposure to waves and the topobathymetry of each island. Such assessment can be useful to determine on which islands adaptation is most urgently needed.

Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union's Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed.

J	Wang, HY				Wang, Haoying			Estimating Flood Risk Impact on Farmland Values Using Boundary Discontinuity: Evidence from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Boundary discontinuity; farmland value; flood insurance; flood risk	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; AGRICULTURE; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	A major consequence of climate change is the growing precipitation variability around many parts of the world leading to increased occurrences of floods. While there has been a rich literature on flood risk in the urban context, flood risk in the agricultural sector has been understudied. The goal of this study is to estimate the impact of flood risk on farmland values in a watershed with active agricultural activities. The novelty of the study is to use the spatial boundary discontinuities along floodplains as a way to control unobserved spatial heterogeneities in a regression analysis framework. Using parcel-level data from Lancaster County (Pennsylvania, USA), we show that cropland is more vulnerable to potential flood risk compared to noncrop farmland. Specifically, cropland parcels on average experience a 13% (or $3,895/acre in 2015 USD, with the 95% confidence interval being [$510, $7352]) value reduction if exposed to a 1% or higher annual chance of flooding. The flood risk impact on noncrop farmland is statistically insignificant. The difference between cropland and noncrop farmland in valuing the potential flood risk implies different flood preparedness and risk management strategies. Based on the empirical findings, policy implications for flood insurance, agricultural water management, land-use practice, and other flood mitigation strategies are explored.

However, post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation is still a major challenge due to difficulty in targeting the right beneficiaries and the effectiveness of post-disaster aid. This study proposes a conceptual framework and rehabilitation measures for the judicious allocation of two post-disaster aid programmes in the context of 2010 super flood disasters in Pakistan. Using primary data sets from the most severely affected district of province Punjab, it employs Probit and Tobit models and empirically investigates the determinants of better targeting and aid allocation. The results show that 'cash aid' for house reconstruction was much better targeted than agricultural assistance in compensating the affected households. The targeting and the effectiveness of aid programmes were mainly determined by gender, membership, farmer size and injured members. Finally, this study suggests that for better targeting of post-disaster aid programmes, local governments and international organizations should pay attention to those families with fewer adult females and injured members, and those without CBO membership.

Concerns about the likely influence of global climate change and rising sea levels add further uncertainty to this risk that threatens the livelihood of farmers. With this in mind and in view of the under-developed state of the market for crop insurance in the MRD, we survey rice growers to explore their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for crop insurance by using a choice experiment. The experimental design comprised five attributes, including the type of peril covered - riverine flooding (flooding); flooding triggered by tidal regimes (inundation); or flooding, inundation and wind damage - type of provider; extent of cover and deductible and premium. Two hundred and twenty-six rice-growing farmers were surveyed with each farmer responding to six different choices. Our study shows that WTPs for an insurance plan covering a loss up to 2 million VND/1000m(2)/farming season and having a deductible of 25% of the potential (profit) crop value varied between 200,000 and 500,000 VND/1000m(2) (1USD = 22,550 Vietnamese Dong - VND) for each rice growing season, implying a potential market for crop insurance.

Yet the current understanding of hydrological and flood pattern changes associated with infrastructural development still contains several knowledge gaps, such as the interactions between multiple drivers, which may have serious implications for water management, agricultural production, and ecosystem services. This research attempts to conduct a cumulative assessment of basin-wide hydropower dam construction and irrigation expansion, as well as climate change, implications on discharge, and flood changes in the Cambodian Mekong floodplain. These floodplains offer important livelihoods for a considerable part of the 6.4 million people living on them, as they are among the most productive ecosystems in the world - driven by the annual flood pulse. To assess the potential future impacts, we used an innovative combination of three models: Mekong basin-wide distributed hydrological model IWRM-VMod, with the Mekong delta 1D flood propagation model MIKE-11 and 2D flood duration and extent model IWRM-Sub enabling detail floodplain modelling. We then ran scenarios to approximate possible conditions expected by around 2050. Our results show that the monthly and seasonal hydrological regimes (discharges, water levels, and flood dynamics) will be subject to substantial alterations under future development scenarios. Projected climate change impacts are expected to decrease dry season flows and increase wet season flows, which is in opposition to the expected alterations under development scenarios that consider both hydropower and irrigation. The likely impact of decreasing water discharge in the early wet season (up to -30 %) will pose a critical challenge to rice production, whereas the likely increase in water discharge in the mid-dry season (up to +140 %) indicates improved water availability for coping with drought stresses and sustaining environmental flows. At the same time, these changes would have drastic impacts on total flood extent, which is projected to decline by around 20 %, having potentially negative impacts on floodplain productivity and aquaculture, whilst reducing the flood risk to more densely populated areas. Our findings demonstrate the substantial changes that planned infrastructural development will have on the area, potentially impacting important ecosystems and people's livelihoods, calling for actions to mitigate these changes as well as planning potential adaptation strategies.

Flood resilience in paired US-Mexico border cities: a study of binational risk perceptions	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flooding; Risk perception; Transboundary; US-Mexico border; Resilience; Green infrastructure	CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER-RESOURCES; AMBOS-NOGALES; RIVER FLOODS; MANAGEMENT; SCENARIOS; POLICY	Disastrous floods in the twin cities of Nogales, Arizona, USA, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico (collectively referred to as Ambos Nogales) occur annually in response to monsoonal summer rains. Flood-related hazards include property damage, impairment to sewage systems, sewage discharge, water contamination, erosion, and loss of life. Flood risk, particularly in Nogales, Sonora, is amplified by informal, "squatter" settlements in the watershed floodplain and associated development and infrastructure. The expected increase in precipitation intensity, resulting from climate change, poses further risk to flooding therein. We explore binational community perceptions of flooding, preferences for watershed management, and potential actions to address flooding and increase socio-ecological resilience in Ambos Nogales using standardized questionnaires and interviews to collect data about people and their preferences. We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with local subject matter experts and gathered survey responses from community members in Ambos Nogales. Though survey response was limited, expected frequencies were high enough to conduct Chi-squared tests of independence to test for statistically significant relationships between survey variables. Results showed that respondents with previous experience with flooding corresponded with their level of concern about future floods. Additionally, respondents perceived greater flood-related risks from traveling across town and damage to vehicles than from inundation or damages to their homes or neighborhoods. Binationally, women respondents felt less prepared for future floods than men. On both sides of the border, community members and local experts agreed that Ambos Nogales lacks adequate preparation for future floods. To increase preparedness, they recommended flood risk education and awareness campaigns, implementation of green infrastructure, additional stormwater infrastructure (such as drainage systems), enhanced flood early warning systems, and reduction of flood flows through regulations to reduce the expansion of hard surfaces. This study contributes systematic collection of information about flood risk perceptions across an international border, including novel data regarding risks related to climate change and gender-based assessments of flood risk. Our finding of commonalities across both border communities, in perceptions of flood risk and in the types of risk reduction solutions recommended by community members, provides clear directions for flood risk education, outreach, and preparedness, as well as measures to enhance cross-border cooperation.

It is essential to investigate the change of regional hydrological characteristics in the context of global warming for developing flood mitigation and water utilization strategies in the future. The purpose of this study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of changes in future runoff and flood for the upper Huai River basin by combining future climate scenarios, hydrological model, and flood frequency analysis. The daily bias correction (DBC) statistical downscaling method is used to downscale the global climate model (GCM) outputs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and to generate future daily temperature and precipitation series. The Xinanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model is driven to project changes in future seasonal runoff under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios for two future periods: 2050s (2031-2060) and 2080s (2071-2100) based on model calibration and validation. Finally, the peaks over threshold (POT) method and generalized Pareto (GP) distribution are combined to evaluate the changes of flood frequency for the upper Huai River basin. The results show that 1) GCMs project that there has been an insignificant increasing trend in future precipitation series, while an obvious increasing trend is detected in future temperature series; 2) average monthly runoffs in low-flow season have seen decreasing trends under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios during the 2050s, while there has been an obvious increasing trend of average monthly runoff in high-flow season during the 2080s; 3) there is a decreasing trend in design floods below the 50-year return period under two future scenarios during the 2050s, while there has been an significant increasing trend in design flood during the 2080s in most cases and the amplitude of increase becomes larger for a larger return period. The study suggests that future flood will probably occur more frequently and an urgent need to develop appropriate adaptation measures to increase social resilience to warming climate over the upper Huai River basin.

The purpose of this systematic review is therefore to assess the current literature about the association between these extreme weather events and their impact on the health of the European population. Methods: Observational studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 17, 2020 on health effects of extreme weather events in Europe were searched systematically in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The exposures of interest included extreme temperature, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires. The health impacts included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, respiratory mortality and morbidity, and mental health. We conducted the systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the NICE quality appraisal checklist (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Results: The search yielded 1472 articles, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Studies regarding five extreme weather events (extreme heat events, extreme cold events, wildfires, floods, droughts) were found. A positive association between extreme heat/cold events and overall, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was reported from most studies. Wildfires are likely to increase the overall and cardiovascular mortality. Floods might be associated with the deterioration of mental health instead of mortality. Depending on their length, droughts could have an influence on both respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Contradictory evidence was found in heat-associated morbidity and wildfire-associated respiratory mortality. The associations are inconclusive due to the heterogeneous study designs, study quality, exposure and outcome assessment. Conclusions: Evidence from most of the included studies showed that extreme heat and cold events, droughts, wildfires and floods in Europe have negative impacts on human health including mental health, although some of the associations are not conclusive. Additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results and further studies regarding the effects of other extreme weather events in Europe are to be expected.

Many countries have put forward flood prevention and control measures to cope with global climate change. In this context, the flood toughness analysis and evaluation have been conducted in the Kunming urban area in China as a primary research method, based on ur-ban flood toughness construction, quantitative and visual expression. An evaluation model of ur-ban flood resilience was established by considering the research objects based on the theories and methods of system dynamics, social ecosystems, and the current situation of the research region. The data service consciousness ability, traffic facilities, flood control ability, and the social factors such as comprehensive thinking of natural factors, economic factors, social and cultural factors in the study region. The quantitative factor weighting and GIS visualization methods were used to establish a research area of 100 m * 100 m fishing nets. For the first time, a high-precision spatial distribution map of flood toughness was generated for the main urban area of Kunming. The spa-tial differentiation characteristics of flood toughness in the area were further analyzed to compre-hensively evaluate flood control capacity by a comparative study of historical records of flood disaster points in the region in 2020. The findings of this paper reveal and quantify the influence and factors in urban flood disasters and provide support for subsequent urban construction and flood planning decision-making.

However, steady-state conditions are rarely achieved and a significant portion of the embankment remains unsaturated upon a flood event. If transient water flow and partial saturation are considered, the flood embankment can be designed with steeper slopes on the landside, which may lead to significant savings in terms of earthfill material (i.e., embodied carbon) and footprint (i.e., habitat suppression and expropriation costs). This paper examines the case of flood embankments in the tidal area of the Elbe River in Germany. These embankments must be retrofitted by raising their crest from 5 to 7 m because of the new projection of extreme river levels due to climate change. In this paper, the conventional "prescriptive" design consisting of raising the embankment by maintaining the 1:3 inclination of the landside slope is compared with the "performance-based" design where the inclination of the slope on the landside could be potentially increased up to 1:1, which is shown to be sustainable if partial saturation and transient water flow are considered. Raising the flood embankment with 1:1 landside slope (rather than 1:3) could lead to expropriation cost savings on the order of euro3.9 M/km. For the case of a newly built embankment of 7 m height, the saving would become euro4.5 M/km. An approximate estimation of embodied carbon suggests that the carbon saving would be on the order of 3,100-4,200 tCO(2)e/km.

In particular, the response of riverine DOM chemistry to reservoir flood control during extreme storm events is still unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, the mechanism of DOM variation in Yangtze River with the world's largest Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) operation during an extreme storm event was explored. Optical and molecular properties of DOM varied significantly from upstream to downstream in non-TGR area, while no significant variation in DOM chemistry was observed in TGR area. The results uncovered a short time transformation of DOM from non-TGR area to TGR area, demonstrating that although storm event induced chemodiversity bloom of riverine DOM, flood control of TGR "re-constrained" DOM to more similar chemistry mainly under the influence of turbidity involved DOM transformation (e.g., adsorption/desorption and flocculation). Furthermore, combined with the hydrological information, we found that although TGR temporarily blocked dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flow during the flood event, the abundance of biologically recalcitrant DOC increased in TGR, which would contribute to its further transportation to downstream watershed. This study emphasizes the impact of TGR on extreme storm event-induced DOM dynamics, which also hints a better understanding of the crucial role of anthropogenic activity in affecting carbon cycling under extreme climate change.

For a given multivariate flood event, the corresponding flood risk under stationary condition is usually estimated by a constant exceedance probability. However, under the nonstationary condition, the exceedance probability for a given multivariate flood event varies from year to year, therefore, the method of quantifying flood risk based on the stationary assumption is no longer applicable to the nonstationary cases. This paper aimed at quantifying multivariate flood risk under nonstationary condition by constructing multivariate flood distribution based on a dynamic C-vine copula. The five-dimensional multivariate flood series of the Upper Yangtze River is selected as a case study. Future climate change and reservoirs are considered as covariates to carry out the multivariate flood frequency analysis, and multivariate flood risk corresponding to different exceedance probabilities (AND, Kendall and OR cases) is further calculated. It is found that both marginal distributions and dependence structure of the multivariate flood series are nonstationary due to the impacts of climate change and reservoir regulation. For multivariate flood risk, the nonstationary case is significantly different from the stationary case, and the marginal nonstationarities play a dominant role in affecting the multivariate flood risk. In addition, risk associated with AND exceedance probability is more sensitive to the nonstationarity of the marginal distribution and dependence structure than risks associated with Kendall and OR exceedance probability. The multivariate flood risk analysis considering the joint characteristics of multiple flood attributes might be helpful to decision-makers for flood control and water resources management under a changing environment.

With climate change already said to affect the intensity of rainfall, there is a need to investigate if there is a change in the probability of significant to extreme daily rainfall across South Africa. This was investigated through the analysis of the daily time series of 70 manual rainfall stations, over the period 1921 to 2020. The analysis period was divided into two equal periods of 50 years for comparison. With the application of the gamma distribution, it is shown that most stations experienced an increase in the probability of receiving more than 50 mm per day, defined as significant rainfall, in the latter half of the analysis period. Also, most stations showed an increase in their 1:50-and 1:100-year return period values, with some stations over the eastern parts showing increases of over 100 mm. There was also an increase in the probability of "heavy rainfall " (> 75 mm) and "very heavy rainfall " events (> 115 mm) between the first and second half of the analysis period for most stations over the country when applying the Peak-Over-Threshold approach. In summary, the results indicate that, although the number of rain days has remained near-constant over the 1921-2020 period, the probability of experiencing significant and extreme daily rainfall events has increased generally for most regions in South Africa. This is of concern as rainfall of this nature can have serious consequences in terms of flooding, erosion, and damage to agriculture and infrastructure.

Understanding the impact of anthropogenic catchment features such as fish ponds on the hydrology and the temperature regime of such streams is, therefore, important. In this study, runoff in a FPM catchment with more than 150 small ponds was simulated using SWAT and compared to a scenario without ponds. Additionally, water temperature was monitored hourly along three steams over 2.5 years, at sites upstream and downstream of the inflow of pond outlet channels. Temperature metrics were related to land use within a 180 m corridor along the streams. Peak flows were reduced by 1.5% with ponds, while low flows were increased by 4.5%. In summer, temperature in pond effluents was higher than in the receiving stream, depending on the proximity of the inflow points. Discharge from close-by ponds increased summer stream temperature directly downstream of the inflow by up to 5.5 degrees C. These increased temperatures were partly compensated by groundwater contribution in forested areas. In contrast, stream temperature significantly further increased along stretches flowing through open land, persisting independently of pond inflows. We suggest incorporating this knowledge on pond- and land use-dependent effects on stream temperature regimes into the conservation management of FPM and other cold-stenothermic species, as well as into climate change mitigation strategies targeting an increased resilience against temperature extremes.

J	Freudenreich, H; Aladysheva, A; Brück, T				Freudenreich, Hanna; Aladysheva, Anastasia; Brueck, Tilman			Weather shocks across seasons and child health: Evidence from a panel study in the Kyrgyz Republic	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Stunting; Weather shocks; Kyrgyzstan	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; RAINFALL SHOCKS; DETERMINANTS; MORTALITY; DROUGHT; HEIGHT; UNDERNUTRITION; CONSEQUENCES; TEMPERATURE	It has been shown consistently in the literature that early life exposure to extreme weather events affects children's nutritional status and related long-term health and well-being outcomes. The effects of weather shocks other than rainfall, as well as heterogeneous effects among population subgroups and moderators of this relationship, however, are less well understood. By combining a rich three-wave representative household panel dataset from Kyrgyzstan, a country where weather extremes such as droughts, floods but also cold spells are predicted to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change in the near future, with location-matched weather data, this paper analyzes how different weather shocks (cold winter, drought, excessive rainfall) affect the probability of stunting of children under five. Using fixed effects regression models, we find that children under 20 months are most severely affected by all three types of early life weather shocks. Most notably, we find that cold shocks experienced in winter increase the probability of stunting, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for households that mainly rely on electricity for indoor heating, potentially due to frequent power cuts occurring in winter. We do not find rural/urban differences, but we find some seasonal effects of shock exposure. Overall, effects are driven by boys, even though we do not find statistically significant gender differences. Identifying the geographical and sociodemographic subgroups of children most vulnerable to extreme weather events can support the design of targeted policies addressing child malnutrition.

Flexibility and robustness can be used to deal with future uncertainty. This study developed an integrated modeling framework that extends previous studies to the spatial domain to assess the future flood risks and the cost and benefit of three adaptation measures for four types of buildings in Shanghai. Real options analysis (ROA) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) were integrated to develop a dynamic adaptation pathway and identify robust adaptation options. The results show that: (1) Sea level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai; (2) Among the three flood control measures, wet-floodproofing has the best economic performance in terms of both the net present value and the benefit/cost ratio, followed by dry-floodproofing, and elevation; (3) Dry-floodproofing can be used at the beginning of the future period (2030-2100), and it can be replaced by wet-floodproofing in 2035-2042; the elevation measure also shows good performance at the beginning of implementation, but its performance will decline after 2041-2045; (4) The combined strategy of dry- and wet-floodproofing in 2044-2046 and a hybrid strategy combining the three measures should be the optimal solution for reducing the flood risks in 2047-2051. The methodology developed in this study can provide insights for coastal cities to formulate cost-effective and feasible adaptation strategies in a deeply uncertain future.

J	Tsao, HH; Leu, YG; Chou, LF; Tsao, CY				Tsao, Hao-Han; Leu, Yih-Guang; Chou, Li-Fen; Tsao, Chao-Yang			A Method of Multi-Stage Reservoir Water Level Forecasting Systems: A Case Study of Techi Hydropower in Taiwan	ENERGIES			English	Article						hydropower; reservoir water level forecasting; multi-stage architecture	FUZZY-NEURAL CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; RIVER; NETWORKS; PLANT	Reservoirs in Taiwan often provide hydroelectric power, irrigation water, municipal water, and flood control for the whole year. Taiwan has the climatic characteristics of concentrated rainy seasons, instantaneous heavy rains due to typhoons and rainy seasons. In addition, steep rivers in mountainous areas flow fast and furiously. Under such circumstances, reservoirs have to face sudden heavy rainfall and surges in water levels within a short period of time, which often causes the water level to continue to rise to the full level even though hydroelectric units are operating at full capacity, and as reservoirs can only drain the flood water, this results in the waste of hydropower resources. In recent years, the impact of climate change has caused extreme weather events to occur more frequently, increasing the need for flood control, and the reservoir operation has faced severe challenges in order to fulfil its multipurpose requirements. Therefore, in order to avoid the waste of hydropower resources and improve the effectiveness of the reservoir operation, this paper proposes a real-time 48-h ahead water level forecasting system, based on fuzzy neural networks with multi-stage architecture. The proposed multi-stage architecture provides reservoir inflow estimation, 48-h ahead reservoir inflow forecasting, and 48-h ahead water level forecasting. The proposed method has been implemented at the Techi hydropower plant in Taiwan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively increase energy efficiency and allow the reservoir water resources to be fully utilized. In addition, the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of the hydropower plant, especially when rain is heavy.

Here, we have attempted to disentangle the relationship between changing environmental conditions and hydro-climatic extremes considering associated uncertainties for the Subarnarekha, a flood prone-basin of India. A comprehensive, integrated modelling system was developed that incorporates a spatially explicit land-use model, a hydrological model, and an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs). MIKE SHE/MIKE HYDRO RIVER was used to simulate the hydrological processes. The uncertainties associated with model parameters, model inputs, and model structures are analysed collectively using 'quantile regression.' A transferable framework was developed for the analysis of hydro-climatic extremes that deal with numerous aspects like sensitivity, occurrences, severity, and persistence for four-time horizons: baseline (1976-2005) and early (2020s), mid (2050s), end-centuries (2080s). ANOVA is used for partitioning uncertainty due to different sources. The results obtained from numerous analysis of the developed framework suggests that low, high, and medium flows will probably increase in the future (20%-85% increase), indicating a higher risk of floods, especially in the 2050s and 2080s. Partitioning of uncertainty suggests RCMs contribute 40%-62% to the uncertainty in streamflow projections. The developed modelling systems incorporates a flexible framework so update any other water sustainability issue in the future. These findings will help better meet the challenges associated with the possible risk of increasing high flows in the future by ceding references to the decision-makers for framing better prevention measures associated with land-use and climate changes.

Wouter			Cost-benefit analysis of flood-zoning policies: A review of current practice	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						climate change adaptation; cost-benefit analysis; flood; risk reduction; spatial planning; zoning	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; RISK; MITIGATION; PROTECTION; VALUATION; STRATEGIES; REDUCTION; NECESSITY; INSURANCE; FRAMEWORK	One commonly proposed method to limit flood risk is land-use or zoning policies which regulates construction in high-risk areas, in order to reduce economic exposure and its vulnerability to flood events. Although such zoning regulations can be effective in limiting trends in flood risk, they also have adverse impacts on society, for instance by limiting local development of areas near the water. In order to judge whether proposed land-use or zoning policies are a net benefit to society, they should be accepted or rejected based on a societal cost-benefit analysis (CBA). However, conducting a CBA of zoning regulation is complex and comprehensive guidelines of how to do such an analysis are lacking. We offer guidelines for good practice. In order to assess the costs and benefits of zoning as a climate change adaption strategy, they should be assessed at a societal level in order to account for public good features of flood risk reduction strategies, and because costs in one area can be benefits in another region. We propose a multistep process: first, determine the spatial extent of the zoning policy and how interconnected the zoned area is to other locations; second, conduct a CBA using monetary costs and benefits estimated from an integrated hydro-economic model to investigate if total benefits exceed total costs; third, conduct a sensitivity analysis regarding the main assumptions; fourth, conduct a multicriteria analysis (MCA) of the normative outcomes of a zoning policy. A desirable policy is preferred in both the CBA and MCA.

The emissions of N2O also have negative influence on ozone layer of our planet. The major source of the nitrous oxide is denitrification process in soil, which controlled by specific soil microbe society. The pot experiment with flooding to accelerate the denitrification process and the application of the monosilicic add as a source of soluble form of Si was carried out with barley. Several forms of nitrous oxide emission (unlimited carbon denitrification and potential denitrification with or without ethylene application) were measured. The obtained data showed that the application of monosilidc acid to brown soil when growing barley under conditions of soil flooding has a significant effect on nitrogen emission and can change the N2O:N2 ratio. The application of the monosilidc acid reduced the uC-D N2O emission, while increased the PD N emission. Generally the application of the water soluble Si decreased the N2O:N2 ratio. We suggested that the presence of monosilidc add in the system provides a more complete denitrification process with the formation of N-2 in the NO3--> NO2- -> NO -> N2O -> N-2 reaction sequence, while the deficiency of bioactive Si mainly provides the formation and emission of N2O. Considering that N-2 is not a greenhouse gas, we can conclude that application of monosilicic acid to the soil can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the impact of global climate change on agricultural activity.

From a probabilistic perspective, a proper understanding of the response of extreme precipitation to climate change is of significant importance. This study was based on daily precipitation provided by CMIP6 climate models and employed copula functions to construct joint distributions of precipitation amount and precipitation intensity indices at different quantile levels. A spatial-temporal assessment of the susceptibility areas for extreme precipitation in the Yellow River Basin was conducted while considering bivariate return periods and design values. The results indicate that there were significant spatial differences in the bivariate return periods. Taking the R90P-SDII (90) index for a 20a return period as an example, the difference between the maximum and minimum joint return periods within the Yellow River Basin was 1.4 times, while the co-occurring return period was 7.0 times, and the Kendall return period was 4 times. Moreover, this difference increased with the increase in the return period. The magnitude order of the four return periods is as follows: T-And > T-Kendall > TSingle-variable > T-Or. Joint return periods (Or) and co-occurring return periods (And) could be considered as the extreme cases under single-variable return periods, serving as an estimation interval for actual return periods. Under the influence of climate change, the bivariate design values for future periods exhibited a variability increase of 6.76-28.8% compared to historical periods, and this increase grew with higher radiative forcing scenarios, ranking as SSP126 < SSP245 < SSP585. The bivariate design values showed a noticeable difference in variability compared to the single-variable design values, ranging from -0.79% to 18.67%.

Although rice is the most important food in India, feeding more than 60% of the country's population, it is commonly blamed for significant methane (CH4) emissions that accelerate climate change. Higher initial soil organic matter concentrations would create more CH4 under the flooded soil conditions, as reducible soil C is a prerequisite for CH4 generation. In India, rice is generally cultivated in lowlands under continuous flooding. Less extensive organic matter breakdown in lowland rice agroecosystems often significantly impacts the dynamics of soil active and passive C pools. Change from conventional to conservation agriculture might trap a significant quantity of SOC. The study aims to investigate the potential of rice-based soils to sequester C and reduce the accelerated greenhouse effects through modified farming practices, such as crop residue retention, crop rotation, organic farming, varietal selection, conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, and water management. Overall, lowland rice agroecosystems can sequester significant amounts of SOC, but this potential must be balanced against the potential for CH4 emissions. Management practices that reduce CH4 emissions while increasing soil C sequestration should be promoted and adopted to maximize the sustainability of rice agroecosystems. This review is important for understanding the effectiveness of the balance between SOC sequestration and CH(4 )emissions in lowland rice agroecosystems for adopting sustainable agricultural practices in the context of climate change.

This study investigates the effects of climate change on monthly precipitation in the Susurluk Basin located in northwestern Turkey, using innovative trend analysis methods. Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) using star graphics and Improved Visualization for Innovative Trend Analysis (IV-ITA) techniques were used to analyze precipitation data from nine stations in the basin over 50 years (1970-2019), and the findings were compared to classical Mann-Kendall (MK) results. Ac-cording to the trend analysis results, the MK method detected significant trends in only two months in the decreasing direction. In these decreasing trends observed at Simav and Keles stations in November, z values were calculated as-2.38 and-2.05, respectively. IPTA method detected increasing trends in 54 months and decreasing trends in 40 months; this means there is a change of more than 5% between two half series. The IV-ITA method indicated an increase of more than 40% in the low values for January, March, August, and September. In addition, there was an increasing trend of more than 40% in the high values observed in September at all stations. It was observed that mean precipitation heights increased from September to December and then decreased throughout the basin. It is predicted that decreases in precipitation during dry seasons may put intense pressure on agricultural water use and affect water quality. In addition, the increase in precipitation in spring months may increase flood events. It was determined that graphical innovative trend analysis methods are more effective in trend identification than MK, and these methods' results have much higher visual inspection and linguistic interpretation possibilities. Innovative methods allow for more flexible and in-depth analysis using different statistical parameters.

Long-term changes in mean and extreme rainfall events in the region may be of crucial importance in understanding the impacts of climate change. Daily and monthly rainfall data from fifteen climate stations in the study area from 1980 to 2018 and measurements from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) were estimated using the non-parametric innovative trend analysis (ITA) and the Sen slope estimator. The precipitation concentration index (PCI), the precipitation concentration degree (PCD), and the precipitation concentration period (PCP) were used to explore the spatiotemporal variations in the characteristics of rainfall concentrations. The results showed complex spatial patterns of the annual average PCI values across the Sudano-Sahelian region; which varied from values lower in the south to higher in the far north, which were the characteristic of seasonality and a strong seasonal precipitation distribution throughout the year; respectively. The PCD results revealed that the annual rainy days in a year decreased from the south to the far north. Additionally, the PCP results indicated a slightly later occurrence of precipitation. A significant trend toward more intense-extreme rainfall events was observed in most parts of the study area, but a significant trend toward more humid days was observed in the southeastern part. Trends in dry days significantly increased in the central and southwestern parts of the study area. This could mean that the prevalence of flood and drought risks are higher in the study area. Overall, the increase in annual rainfall could benefit the hydro-power sector, agricultural irrigation, the availability of potable water sources, and food security.

This study focuses on the estimation of changes in the hydrological regime in the Fuglebekken catchment in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard). For this purpose, 50 rainfall-runoff models were calibrated using available hydrometeorological observations. The models were validated based on archival flow and SWE observations, and proxy data from time-lapse cameras. Six models (FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J) with the best performance were applied to reconstruct the past hydrological conditions and analyse the trends in flow regime in the period 1979-2020. Statistically significant changes at 0.05 level in the flow regime indicators were detected, including the number of days with the active flow during the calendar year (10.8 d per decade), during the mid-May-November period (9.8 d per decade), the date of the first day with the flow (-4.7 d per decade), and the last day with the flow during mid-May-November (8.4 d per decade). A statistically significant increase in runoff was estimated for two periods from mid-May to the end of June and the second part of August till mid-November. The changes in the first period result from increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelt-driven floods. An estimated runoff increase in the second period corresponds to large increases in rainfall. The increase in air temperature, earlier disappearance of snow, and decrease in precipitation in July and the first part of August result in runoff reduction. The presented results show that the Fuglebekken 'catchment's hydrological regime has already changed. The magnitude of the changes is larger compared to catchments located in lower latitudes.

This study examined the individual and collective changes in reservoir performance at the 13 flood regulation projects within the Willamette River Basin (WRB) in Oregon. By applying a scenario-based analysis, derived as part of a broader collaborative modeling project, operational performance was evaluated in response to climate and operational change scenarios. Results indicated that, for the climate scenarios analyzed, primary operating objectives of flood risk reduction and meeting summer biological opinion (BiOp) flow targets were unlikely to be affected. Modest reductions in the ability to fully refill the reservoirs and to meet spring BiOp flow targets were found, particularly under the more severe warming scenario. However, refilling the reservoirs 2 weeks earlier was effective in reducing the storage deficit introduced by climate change without compromising the ability to meet other operational objectives. Drawdown scenarios for maintenance of aging infrastructure had minimal effect at the system scale. While the model was limited by the number of climate scenarios represented and in its ability to represent the full range of variability of this large basin, the results cumulatively suggested that the hydrologic changes associated with the range of climate change examined were not likely to substantially reduce the reliability of the Willamette Project in meeting operational objectives. Where potential deficiencies emerged, they could largely be mitigated through simple operational changes. Instead, it is likely that changes in the sociopolitical landscape (e.g., water rights allocations) and management of water quality (e.g., temperature, harmful algal blooms) will be as or more important than hydrologic changes in reducing reservoir performance in meeting operational objectives.

Study focus: This study focuses on the impact of local and/or large scale climate change on the river flow in the small and steep river basin. The variability, trend, correlation and change of extreme and mean precipitation and river (flood) runoff are investigated. New hydrological insights: In the small and steep river basins of Japan, the maximum annual flood runoff which occurs in the wet season, is well correlated with maximum precipitation on a daily time scale. Daily flow and precipitation data recorded in the basin from 1960 to 2015, have a correlation coefficient R-2=0.72. A high variability of the maximum and mean annual flows, and significant rising trends in daily extreme precipitation and river (flood) flows were also found in the data analysis. The maximum annual flood has increased on average by 5.98 m(3)/s per year from 330 m(3)/s in 1960; this increase is fully accounted for by the trend in observed maximum annual precipitation which is 1.1 mm/day per year. On an annual timescale maximum precipitation and maximum flood discharges have become substantially higher in phase with the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) in the Pacific Ocean. Time frequency analyses revealed that a periodic component of the annual maximum flood flow in the Banjo River basin with a period of about 6 to 8 years has become significant since the beginning of the 21 st century. The number of days with more than 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 m(3)/s flows has increased, which is important for flood control planning.

J	Ivanov, G				Ivanov, Gennadiy			A Climate Mural for Our Times	ONE EARTH			English	Editorial Material								The impact of Anthropogenic climate change is pervasive across all major ecological and human systems. Without urgent action to mitigate the emissions that drive warming, society will overshoot the 1.5 degrees C global temperature mark and ultimately cause much of the global cryosphere, such as mountain glaciers, to melt. The resulting sea level rise would impose significant socio-ecological burdens, from flooding to habitat loss. In A Climate Mural of Our Times, artist Gennadiy Ivanov, working together with climate scientists from the Universities of East Anglia and Saskatchewan, illustrates the interactions between climate, sea level, and society in the context of the Norfolk coastline and city of Norwich. Warming stripes in the sky illustrate two possible climate futures, one leading to a sustainable green future and the other where we continue to strongly emit CO2 resulting in damaging climate change. This artwork inspires viewers to think deeply and seriously about which future we should choose and calls for cross-community collaborations-among policymakers, scientists, and every one of us-to work together to navigate toward a habitable future.

The Effect of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on Precipitation Extremes in the Hindu Kush Mountains Range	WATER			English	Article						ENSO; Upper Indus Basin; Mann-Kendall test; Innovative Trend Analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; UPPER INDUS BASIN; TREND ANALYSIS; HIMALAYA; EVENTS; ENSO	The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is devastating as it negatively impacts global climatic conditions, which can cause extreme events, including floods and droughts, which are harmful to the region's economy. Pakistan is also considered one of the climate change hotspot regions in the world. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of the ENSO on extreme precipitation events across the Upper Indus Basin. We examined the connections between 11 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) and two ENSO indicators, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI). This analysis covers both annual and seasonal scales and spans the period from 1971 to 2019. Statistical tests (i.e., Mann-Kendall (MK) and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA)) were used to observe the variations in the EPIs. The results revealed that the number of Consecutive Dry Days (CDDs) is increasing more than Consecutive Wet Days (CWDs); overall, the EPIs exhibited increasing trends, except for the Rx1 (max. 1-day precipitation) and Rx5 (max. 5-day precipitation) indices. The ENSO indicator ONI is a temperature-related ENSO index. The results further showed that the CDD value has a significant positive correlation with the SOI for most of the UIB (Upper Indus Basin) region, whereas for the CWD value, high elevated stations gave a positive relationship. A significant negative relationship was observed for the lower portion of the UIB. The Rx1 and Rx5 indices were observed to have a negative relationship with the SOI, indicating that El Nino causes heavy rainfall. The R95p (very wet days) and R99p (extreme wet days) indices were observed to have significant negative trends in most of the UIB. In contrast, high elevated stations depicted a significant positive relationship that indicates they are affected by La Nina conditions. The PRCPTOT index exhibited a negative relationship with the SOI, revealing that the El Nino phase causes wet conditions in the UIB. The ONI gave a significant positive relationship for the UIB region, reinforcing the idea that both indices exhibit more precipitation during El Nino. The above observations imply that while policies are being developed to cope with climate change impacts, the effects of the ENSO should also be considered.

The last Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) was designed with new shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to combine socioeconomic development with greenhouse gas emissions to project future climate.Method: In this study, we used 22 global climate models (GCMs) from CMIP6 to investigate future variations in extreme precipitation and temperature under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios over the upper-middle Huaihe River Basin (UMHRB). Then, the modified Xinanjiang model integrating the flood control module was driven to obtain projections of the daily streamflow and to evaluate the future variations in flood regimes.Results: The results show that 1) the characteristics of future extreme precipitation, such as the average intensity and amount of annual precipitation and extreme precipitation, are projected to increase, and the average, maximum, and minimum temperature values also display substantial increasing trends in the future over the UMHRB; 2) warmer climate will lead to a more severe flood magnitude under the SSP5-8.5 scenario in the far future (2071-2100) over the UMHRB. The results of the multi-model ensemble show that the annual maximum flood peaks (15-day flood volumes) of Wangjiaba and Wujiadu stations are projected to increase by 46.4% (43.1%) and 45.4% (51.1%), respectively, in the far future (2071-2100) under the SSP5-8.5 scenario; and 3) variations in the flood frequency tend to resemble variations in flood magnitude, and the return period of the design flood will obviously decrease under future climate scenarios. For instance, in the far future, under SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the return period of the design flood with a 100-year return period will become 38 years and 31 years for Wangjiaba and Wujiadu stations, respectively.Discussion: The study enhances a more realistic understanding that the occurrence of future extreme precipitation and floods is projected to be more frequent and severe, thereby resulting in an urgent imperative to develop pertinent adaptation strategies to enhance social resilience toward the warming climate.

Many incentive programs exist or are in development to support the adoption of practices that promote soil health for these reasons, but few on-farm trials have compared the intersections of farmer versus researcher observations of soil health or of soil health compared with climate adaptation. The purpose of our study was to assess soil health outcomes and adaptation to simulated climate change in response to cover cropping on working farms enrolled in a Minnesota Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)-funded Environmental Quality Incentives Program. This incentive program required the inclusion of diverse cover crop mixtures into existing farm crop rotations. We conducted farmer surveys, NRCS protocol field soil assessments, and NRCS-recommended laboratory assays on farms from across the state of Minnesota in a paired design comparing fields on the same or adjacent farms of the same soil mapping unit. Although 85% of farmers reported improvements in soil attributes or productivity, most field and laboratory assessments produced a high amount of variability in responsiveness to cover cropping. Despite this variability, we saw a significant decrease in bare ground and significant increases in earthworm counts, cellobiohydrolase microbial activity, and the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS). Although researcher measurements did not show improvement in physical characteristics or infiltration other than the VESS field assessment, 67% of farmers reported improvements to the physical structure of the soil, associated with improved outcomes such as earlier planting dates and consistent crop growth across fields. When more than five species of cover crops were present, the percentage of reported improvements increased to >80%. We also found no significant improvement to climate change adaptation measured by nutrient or sediment loss after a simulated storm event. Together, our results suggest that adding a diverse annual cover crop mix to increase continuous cover can improve characteristics associated with soil health and that there needs to be a stronger focus in understanding variation in realized soil health outcomes on farms, including more co-creation of research with farmer partners.

However, obtaining average values are more straightforward than the high temporal resolution information necessary to catch the extreme events on those tails. Such information is difficult to get in areas lacking sufficient rain stations. Thanks to the development of Satellite Precipitation Estimates with a daily resolution, this problem has been overcome, so Extreme Precipitation Indices (EPI) can be calculated for the entire Colombian territory. However, Colombia is strongly affected by the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. Therefore, it is pertinent to ask if the EPI's long-term change due to climate change is more critical than the anomalies due to climate variability induced by the warm and cold phases of ENSO (El Nino and La Nina, respectively). In this work, we built EPI annual time series at each grid-point of the selected Satellite Precipitation Estimate (CHIRPSv2) over Colombia to answer the previous question. Then, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was used to compare the samples drawn in each case (i.e., change tests due to both long-term and climatic variability). After performing the analyses, we realized that the importance of the change depends on the region analyzed and the considered EPI. However, some general conclusions became evident: during El Nino years (La Nina), EPI's anomaly follows the general trend of reduction -drier conditions- (increase; -wetter conditions-) observed in Colombian annual precipitation amount, but only on the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region. In the Eastern plains of Colombia (Orinoquia and Amazonian region), EPI show a certain insensitivity to change due to climatic variability. On the other hand, EPI's long-term changes in the Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Andean region are spatially scattered. Still, long-term changes in the eastern plains have a moderate spatial consistency with statistical significance.

In the present study, based on IPCC's latest report, outputs of three GCMs, the EC-EARTH, the HadGEM2-ES and the MIROC5 were downscaled by the LARS-WG model and under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Also, variations in precipi-tation, maximum and minimum temperatures for the time series 2021-2040, 2041-2060 and 2061-2080 have been projected and the precipitation extreme values in Gumbel distribution were evaluated. For this purpose, the climate records obtained from Shiraz, Lar and Abadeh synoptic stations in Fars province were used to establish the baseline period (1985-2010). The results of all the stations show that Changes in maximum and minimum temperatures under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios have increased. The increase in minimum temperature for the baseline period compared to the upcoming period 2021-2040 under the selected scenarios were 1.43 and 1.65C, respectively. The increase in precipitation for the baseline period compared to the upcoming period (2021-2040) under the two scenarios were up to 2.93 and 1.95, respectively. Furthermore, longer return periods are accompanied by higher amounts of probable maximum precipitation under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, where extreme precipitation is showing higher level of rise under the latter scenario.

Therefore, pioneering research has dedicated efforts to optimize the design of NBS, to evaluate their wider co-benefits and to understand promoting and/or hampering governance conditions for the uptake of NBS. In this article, we aim to complement this research by conducting a comprehensive literature review of factors shaping people's perceptions of NBS as a means to reduce hydro-meteorological risks. Based on 102 studies, we identified six topics shaping the current discussion in this field of research: (1) valuation of the co-benefits (including those related to ecosystems and society); (2) evaluation of risk reduction efficacy; (3) stakeholder participation; (4) socio-economic and location-specific conditions; (5) environmental attitude, and (6) uncertainty. Our analysis reveals that concerned empirical insights are diverse and even contradictory, they vary in the depth of the insights generated and are often not comparable for a lack of a sound theoretical-methodological grounding. We, therefore, propose a conceptual model outlining avenues for future research by indicating potential inter-linkages between constructs underlying perceptions of NBS to hydro-meteorological risks.

Projected climate change and associated global warming may lead to an increase in extreme weather events that results in greater inundation from storm surges or massive precipitation. For example, record flooding during Hurricane Katrina or, more recently, during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, led to many people being cut off from aid and unable to evacuate. This study focuses on the impact of severe weather under climate change for areas of Harris County, TX that are susceptible to flooding either by storm surge or extreme rainfall and evaluates the transit demand and availability in those areas. Future risk of flooding in Harris County was assessed by GIS mapping of the 100-year and 500-year FEMA floodplains and most extreme category 5 storm tide and global sea level rise. The flood maps have been overlaid with population demographics and transit accessibility to determine vulnerable populations in need of transit during a disaster. It was calculated that 70% of densely populated census block groups are located within the floodplains, including a disproportional amount of low-income block groups. The results also show a lack of transit availability in many areas susceptible to extreme storm surge exaggerated with sea level rise. Further study of these areas to improve transit infrastructure and evacuation strategies will improve the outcomes of extreme weather events in the future.

Recent climate change adaptation policy strives to promote bottom-up, citizen-driven initiatives to improve local resilience. How and under what conditions citizens may engage in collective action remains unclear, however. We employ a mixed-methods approach in Eastern Tyrol, Austria, combining stakeholder workshops with a survey of 216 citizens at risk. Results show that bottom-up citizen initiatives can provide multiple benefits, such as increasing risk awareness and local adaptive capacities. While citizens are open-minded to assuming a broad range of activities and responsibilities, local stakeholders in natural hazard management prefer to limit civic engagement to support roles, mostly during recovery from a natural hazard event. Citizen initiatives tend to emerge in communities with weak institutional capital. This may lead to conflicts with existing institutions over allocation of competences and power. Contrastingly, social and human forms of capital support the formation of initiatives; however, low willingness of citizens to assume leadership positions may be a bottleneck for sustained initiatives. Public administration and emergency organisations should address current institutional barriers. They should empower and allow citizens to act autonomously.

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable and ill-prepared to flash flooding, compared to their larger counterparts, so they are disproportionately affected by such extreme weather events. This study reports on the results of a quantitative survey of SME owners/managers and employs quantile regression analysis in an attempt to shed light on factors affecting resilience barriers to flash floods. Findings suggest that the effect of organizational size on SME barriers is reduced as barriers increase. In contrast, the effect of organizational age is found to be positive with low magnitudes when barriers are either very low or considerably high in contrast to negative effects when barriers are at moderate levels. A positive influence of the industrial affiliation at all barrier levels is also identified. Previous experience with flash flooding events as well as the effect of profitability are found to have negative impact in most levels of analysis. The assessment highlights the need for targeted intervention and assistance to the various segments of the SME sector through customized guidance and/or ad hoc regulation by focusing on factors explaining barriers to resilience.

This is particularly true on the Mediterranean coast, where persistent urbanization is coupled with tourism development, further intensifying coastal erosion, flood risk, heat stress and biodiversity loss, while decreasing carbon sequestration. In this research, high-resolution imperviousness data were analyzed through a geospatial methodology to detect patterns and processes in a heavily burdened Mediterranean coastal area, namely Greece. The methodology was structured on a set of GIS tools, analyzing the distribution of new impervious cover between 2006 and 2018, to evaluate pressures exerted on coastal territories and on the environmental protection network. The results revealed relatively slow rates of impervious land expansion at a nationwide scale, mostly attributed to the economic recession period in Greece. However, certain locations exhibited continuing artificialization of land even within Natura 2000 areas, while future pressures on coastal territories are expected to increase due to the restarting of construction activity and the continuing dynamic of the mass tourism sector. The conclusions imply that controlling for imperviousness is important in order to develop spatial planning policies for climate resilience, which should be decisively enforced in the Mediterranean to prevent a business-as-usual scenario.

However, relatively little is known about the history and current state of glacial lakes in the High Arctic. This study aims to address this issue by providing the first inventory of glacial lakes in Svalbard, focusing in particular on the post-Little Ice Age evolution of glacial lakes and their typology. To do so, we used aerial photographs and satellite imagery together with archival topographic data from 1936 to 2020. The inventory comprises the development of 566 glacial lakes (146 km(2)) that were still in direct contact with glaciers during the period 2008-2012. The results show a consistent increase in the total area of glacial lakes from the 1930s to 2020 and suggest an apparent link between climatic and geological factors, and the formation of specific lake dam types: moraine, ice, or bedrock. We also detected 134 glacial lake drainage events that have occurred since the 1930s. This study shows that Svalbard has one of the highest rates of glacial lake development in the world, which is an indicator of the overall dynamics of landscape change in the archipelago in response to climate change.

We aimed to evaluate how contrasting periods of drought and flooding affect the demographic rates of alluvial forest patches and how these effects are related to forest functional traits and diversity. We studied six alluvial forest fragments in the floodplain along the Sapucai River in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. We carried out forest inventories in two sequential periods (2005-2011, 2011-2017). We also measured functional traits for species with higher densities and evaluated how the diversity index varied over time. We found that the period with drought (2011-2017) presented higher mortality, higher loss of basal area, and lower recruitment than the period with flood (2005-2011). The alluvial forest responded more intensely and negatively to the impacts of drought (second period) than to the impacts of flooding (first period). Lower diversity plots had higher mortality and basal area loss. We found overall degradation of the alluvial forest with a loss of basal area, a decrease in tree density, and an increase in species with acquisitive functional traits related to a strong drought effect. Thus, increasing extreme events like stronger floods but particularly droughts in function of climate change may be especially pernicious for alluvial forest persistence.

The main goal of the research was to examine the multiannual changes in precipitations in the April-September period in 1971-2018, depending on circulation conditions, based on Ojrzynska's classification. The analysis was carried out based on meteorological data from Polish and German meteorological stations. The results showed that most of precipitation totals and intensive precipitations were observed under SW-A and SW-C circulation, whereas the anticyclonic types of NE-A, NW-A and SW-A were mainly responsible for dry days occurrence. In terms of multiannual changes, most of the stations were characterized by insignificant trends for the considered indices. Some positive trends were observed for intensive precipitations in the lower hypsometric zones. In the mountains, a decreasing tendency dominated for both precipitation totals and intensive precipitations, especially for the northern types of circulation. Furthermore, a significant increase was reported throughout the region for most of the indices for the SW-A type, including precipitation totals, strong precipitations and dry days. Considering the observed trends, floods related to heavy rains can intensify in the lowlands, while a potential increase in the anticyclonic circulation can significantly limit water resources in the region.

In this study, we collected daily rainfall data from 21 rainfall stations in Shaanxi Province from 1961 to 2017, and calculated eight extreme climate indices. Annual and seasonal concentration indices (CI) were also calculated. The trends in the changes in precipitation were calculated using the M-K test and Sen's slope. The results show that the precipitation correlation index and CI (concentration index) in Shaanxi Province are higher in the south and lower in the north. For the annual scale, the CI value ranges from 0.6369 to 0.6820, indicating that Shaanxi Province has a high precipitation concentration and an uneven distribution of annual precipitation. The eight extreme precipitation indices of most rainfall stations showed a downward trend during the study period, and more than half of the stations passed the 0.05 confidence interval test. Among them, the Z value of PRCPTOT (annual total precipitation in wet days) at Huashan station reached -6.5270. The lowest slope of PRCPTOT reached -14.3395. This shows that annual rainfall in Shaanxi Province has been decreasing in recent decades. These findings could be used to make decisions about water resources and drought risk management in Shaanxi Province, China.

Here, we used the Google Earth Engine to assess the droughts and floods and their impacts on croplands and crop production over 40 years from 1980 to 2019. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) as the basis for determining the drought and flood levels, and crop damage levels, crop production loss in both the Monsoon Climate Region (MCR) and the Equatorial Climate Region (ECR) of Southeast Asia was assessed over 47,192 grid points with 10 x 10-kilometer resolution. We found that rainfed crops were severely affected by droughts in the MCR and floods in the ECR. About 9.42 million ha and 3.72 million ha of cropland was damaged by droughts and floods, respectively. We estimated a total loss of 20.64 million tons of crop production between 2015 and 2019. Rainfed crops in Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar were strongly affected by droughts, whereas Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia were more affected by floods over the same period. Accordingly, four levels of policy interventions were prioritized by considering the geolocated crop damage levels. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we used a high-resolution land-atmosphere coupled regional climate model to assess the impacts of recent greening on China's regional summer climate. Our results inferred a country-averged surface cooling of 0.11 degrees C and a precipitation increase of 0.02 mm/d during summer in response to China's widespread greening. We also identified significant regional variability in the climatic responses to vegetation change. The regions of northern China showed significant cooling, including the Northeast China Plain, Loess Plateau, and the eastern areas of the Northern arid and semiarid region; however, no significant temperature changes were simulated in southern China. Summer precipitation decreased in southern China and increased in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and the northern Loess Plateau. Variations in moisture flux convergence had a stronger influence on the precipitation patterns relative to evapotranspiration. Furthermore, our results suggested that vegetation greening would influence the occurrence of extreme climate events by decreasing the number of heatwave days (by 1-3 days, particularly in northern China), reducing the number of continuous drought events in northern China, and minimizing the risks of floods in southern China.

The New York City Panel on Climate Change Antarctic Rapid Ice Melt (ARIM) upper-end, low probability sea level rise (SLR) scenario, which incorporates recent ice loss trends, improved ice sheet-ocean-atmosphere modeling, and potential ice sheet destabilization, projects SLR of up to 2.1 m by the 2080s and up to 2.9 m by 2100, at high greenhouse gas emissions ((SPCC, 2019). These results exceed previous high-end SLR projections (90th percentile) of 1.5 m by the 2080s and 1.9 m by 2100, relative to 2000-2004 (NPCC, 2015). By 2100, the 1% annual chance (100-year) floodplain could cover 1/3 of the city's total area under ARIM; around 1/5 of the area could be flooded during monthly high tides. Some low-lying locations could become permanently inundated by late century. Will New York City coastal resiliency initiatives, guided, in part by NPCC findings, suffice for very high sea levels? Additional research is needed to determine technological, environmental, or economic limitations to coastal protection and to decide when and where strategic relocation may become necessary.

Assessment of the flood hazard arising from land use change in a forested catchment in northern Iran	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						catchment runoff; deforestation; flash floods; flood hazard; land use change; northern Iran	COVER CHANGE; SCS-CN; HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; USE SCENARIOS; RIVER-BASIN; SOIL LOSS; RUNOFF; MODEL; WATERSHEDS	The provinces of northern Iran that border the Caspian Sea are forested and may be prone to increased risks of flooding due to deforestation and other land use changes, in addition to climate change effects. This research investigated changes in runoff from a small forested catchment in northern Iran for several land use change scenarios and the effects of higher rainfall and high antecedent soil moisture. Peak discharges and total runoff volumes from the catchment were estimated using the U.S. Soil Conservation Service "Curve Number" (SCS-CN) method and the SCS dimensionless unit hydrograph. This method was selected for reasons of data availability and operational simplicity for flood managers. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manipulate spatial data for use in the catchment runoff modelling. The results show that runoff is predicted to increase as a result of deforestation, which is dependent on the proportion of the catchment area affected. However, climate change presents a significant flood hazard even in the absence of deforestation. Other land use changes may reduce the peak discharges of all return period floods. Therefore a future ban on timber extraction, combined with agricultural utilisation of rangeland, could prove effective as "nature-based" flood reduction measures throughout northern Iran.

Coupling Natural Hazard Estimates with Road Network Analysis to Assess Vulnerability and Risk: Case Study of Freetown (Sierra Leone)	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							IMPACT; DAMAGE	Many of the world's most disaster-prone cities are also the most difficult to model and plan. Their high vulnerability to natural hazards is often defined by low levels of economic resources, data scarcity, and limited professional expertise. As the frequency and severity of natural disasters threaten to increase with climate change, and as cities sprawl and densify in hazardous areas, better decision-making tools are needed to mitigate the effects of near- and long-term extreme events. We use mostly public data from landslide and flooding events in 2017 in Freetown, Sierra Leone to simulate the events' impact on transportation infrastructure and continue to simulate alternative high-risk disasters. From this, we propose a replicable framework that combines natural hazard estimates with road network vulnerability analysis for data-scarce environments. Freetown's most central road intersections and transects are identified, particularly those that are both prone to serviceability loss due to natural hazard and whose disruption would cause the most severe immediate consequences on the entire road supply in terms of connectivity. Variations in possible road use are also tested in areas with potential road improvements, pointing to opportunities to harden infrastructure or reinforce redundancy in strategic transects of the road network. This method furthers network science's contributions to transportation resilience under hydrometeorological hazard and climate change threats with the goal of informing investments and improving decision-making on transportation infrastructure in data-scarce environments.

Our study assesses the major factors contributing to extreme coastal water levels (ECWLs) from 1994 to 2015. ECWLs are categorized into low, moderate, and severe levels corresponding to the 30th, 60th, and 98th percentiles, respectively. Using these three levels over the Pleiades satellite-derived digital elevation model topography, potential flood extent zones are mapped. ECWLs have the potential to flood more than 40% of the study area, including socioeconomically important sites such as tourist beach resorts, Cape St. Paul lighthouse, and Fort Prinzenstein. In this study, all coastal flooding events recorded by the municipality of Keta fall within the 98th percentile category. Our results show a gradual increase in the frequency of flooding over the years. Flooding events are caused by a compound effect of the tide, sea level anomaly, waves, and atmospheric conditions. Finally, while wave run-up is the major contributor to coastal flooding, the tide is the one varying most, which facilitates a simple early warning system based on waves and tide but adds uncertainty and complicates long-term predictability.

Growing consensus asserts that extreme precipitation events will only rise in the years to come. However, an increase in extreme precipitation events does not necessarily correspond to higher flood risk. Much onus lies on the antecedent conditions before the storm events. Despite the importance of Soil Moisture (SM) - Precipitation (P) dependence in runoff generation, relatively few studies have unraveled the SM - P dependence. Previous studies were constrained by the direct trivial relationship existing between SM and P, and hence there is a need to understand direction and dynamical interdependency. We employed Event Coincidence Analysis (ECA) to identify and quantify the preconditioning of P extremes by soil moisture (SM) anomalies. High precursor coincidence rate (greater than45%) was obtained for traditional flash flood-prone areas over India - Ganga river basin, West-flowing rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra including Luni, inland drainage of Rajasthan and Narmada river basin, indicating the robustness of the approach. The trigger coincidence rate reveals strong SM-P coupling over central India. Our results indicate the applicability of ECA in characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM-P dependence over India.	[Manoj, J.

In this work, an urban water cycle (UWC) strategy based on the best management practices (BMPs) of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) is proposed for the transition of a coastal city in the south of Portugal into a water-sensitive city (WSC), in line with the Municipal Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation of Loule (EMAAC of Loule). The city's watershed was identified using the ArcMap Hydrology toolset with geospatial data provided by Loule's Municipal Council Operational Unit for Adaptation to Climate Change and Circular Economy (UOACEC). A broad characterisation of the study area was conducted, identifying existing resources to further develop a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. The Hydrology toolset outputs, precipitation events records, and survey results were used to identify flood-prone areas. The opportunities and threats identified were further used to develop the transition strategy, which is focused on critical areas identified and supported by BMPs, including source control, attenuation, treatment and infiltration measures, permeable pavements, rainwater harvesting systems, and bioretention basins. The approach is designed to increase the city's resilience to climate extremes, as well as community engagement towards UWC management.

Salinity and inundation effects on productivity of brackish tidal marsh plants in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Biomass; Climate change; Plant growth; Sea-level rise; Suisun Bay	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT-MARSH; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; COASTAL WETLANDS; ELEVATED CO2; RESPONSES; GROWTH; ACCRETION; IMPACTS; STRESS	Plant productivity is central to numerous ecosystem functions in tidal wetlands. We examined how productivity of brackish marsh plants in northern California responded to abiotic stress gradients of inundation and salinity using two experimental approaches. In a greenhouse study with varying salinity, shoot production and biomass of Juncus balticus, Schoenoplectus acutus and S. americanus all declined monotonically with higher salinity, with evidence of differences in sensitivity among species by their varied functional responses. Salinity also negatively affected fecundity for the one species (S. americanus) that produced enough inflorescences during the experiment for analysis. In a field manipulation of inundation and initial pore water salinity, total end-of-season biomass and other metrics of growth in the high marsh species, J. balticus, had unimodal relationships with inundation. Root production tended to be greater strongly impacted by greater inundation than shoot production. The salinity treatment quickly dissipated for treatments that were flooded more frequently but persisted at a higher marsh elevation where it suppressed plant growth. These results suggest that both increased flooding and salinity associated with climate change and sea-level rise may negatively impact productivity of brackish marsh species, but with variable effects by species and stressor.

Ap-plying effective water-saving measures to improve irrigation efficiency and evaluate their future water-saving capabilities is crucial for ensuring the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture. Based on the daily meteorological data from 15 global climate models (GCMs) in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), this study used the AquaCrop model to perform high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) grid simulations of cotton yields and irrigation requirements. The study also investigated the ability of film-mulched drip irrigation (FMDI) to improve future irrigation efficiency under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585) in the Tarim River Basin (TRB), Central Asia, from 2025 to 2100. The results showed that the cotton yield and irrigation water productivity (WPI) in the TRB exhibited an upward trend of 13.82 kg/ha/decade (80.68 kg/ha/decade) and 0.015 kg/m(3)/decade (0.068 kg/m(3)/decade), respectively, during the study period. The cotton yield and WPI were higher in the northern, northwestern plains, and northeastern intermountain basin areas, where they reach over 4000 kg/ha and 0.8 kg/m(3)/decade. However, the cotton yield and WPI were lower in the southwestern part of the study area. Therefore, large-scale cotton production was not recommended there. Furthermore, compared to flood irrigation, the use of FMDI can, on average, improve the WPI by approx. 25% and reduce irrigation water requirements by more than 550 m(3)/ha. Therefore, using FMDI can save a substantial amount of irrigation water in cotton production, which is beneficial for improving irrigation efficiency and ensuring the future stable production of cotton in the TRB. The research results provide a scientific reference for the efficient utilization and management of water resources for cotton production in the TRB and in similar arid regions elsewhere in the world.

The main objective of this paper is to conduct an up-to-date review on the impact analysis and risk assessment of urban pluvial floods on road traffic in terms of theories, methods, innovative results, and techniques. The systemic overview includes these topics of the pluvial flood-induced vehicle driving hazards, road traffic capacity loss, risk assessment approaches, and pluvial flood inundation modeling applications. Based on such plenty of literature, the physical and socioeconomic susceptibilities of road traffic exposed to urban pluvial flood have been repeatedly proven. Additionally, the pluvial flood inundation modeling methods, which are the starting point and essential operation for impact analysis and risk assessment related to road flooding, are statistically discussed and compared in this work. The recent advances achieved in the involved scopes are expected to provide an insight into the feasible options for some areas and regions that are or will be at risk from pluvial flooding.

Global warming-induced melting and thawing of the cryosphere are severely altering the volume and timing of water supplied from High Mountain Asia, adversely affecting downstream food and energy systems that are relied on by billions of people. The construction of more reservoirs designed to regulate streamflow and produce hydropower is a critical part of strategies for adapting to these changes. However, these projects are vulnerable to a complex set of interacting processes that are destabilizing landscapes throughout the region. Ranging in severity and the pace of change, these processes include glacial retreat and detachments, permafrost thaw and associated landslides, rock-ice avalanches, debris flows and outburst floods from glacial lakes and landslide-dammed lakes. The result is large amounts of sediment being mobilized that can fill up reservoirs, cause dam failure and degrade power turbines. Here we recommend forward-looking design and maintenance measures and sustainable sediment management solutions that can help transition towards climate change-resilient dams and reservoirs in High Mountain Asia, in large part based on improved monitoring and prediction of compound and cascading hazards.

J	Morote, AF; Hernández, M				Morote, Alvaro-Francisco; Hernandez, Maria			Social Representations of Flooding of Future Teachers of Primary Education (Social Sciences): A Geographical Approach in the Spanish Mediterranean Region	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						floods; instruction; geography	POLICY	The risk of flooding is the main natural hazard that affects the European Mediterranean region. This hazard has worsened in recent decades due to the occupation of flood areas and the effects of climate change. Therefore, understanding and gaining a more in-depth knowledge of social representations of flooding is important. In addition, interest in this subject is accentuated in the case of future teachers. This is because it is mandatory to teach this subject in Primary Education (Grades 1-6; Social Sciences subject). The aims of this research are: (1) To explore the instruction about flooding received by future teachers during their school period, and (2) to examine their perception about factors influencing flood risk. Methodologically, a questionnaire was distributed among future teachers of Primary Education (Faculty of Teaching Training, University of Valencia, Spain). The results regarding the respondents' perception show that only 21.3% of the future teachers received instruction about floods during their school period. With reference to factors that influence floods, they mostly believe that the main factors are climate change and the spatial land management. Furthermore, 51.3% believe that this phenomenon has been increasing over the last few years, and 82.5% think that it rains heavier today.

"We Need to Do Something About This": Children and Youth's Post-Disaster Views on Climate Change and Environmental Crisis	SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY			English	Article							DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; PERCEPTIONS; POPULATION; HURRICANES; HAZARDS	Research is increasingly uncovering the many ways that individuals affected by disasters change their environmental views in response to their direct experience of such catastrophic events. There is a growing body of research that focuses on adults' environmental views, revealing that they often remain complacent toward environmental problems even after experiencing a disaster. However, very little research examines whether and to what extent children and youth's environmental views shift and change after experiencing a disaster. This article fills this gap by specifically focusing on the environmental views and practices of 83 children and youth between the ages of 5 and 17 years who experienced the 2013 Southern Alberta Flood, the costliest flood disaster in Canadian history. Findings suggest that disaster catalyzes a process of reflexivity in children and youth. Experiencing the flood prompted children and youth to think more about the environment than prior to the flood; contemplate larger environmental issues, such as climate change, as the root cause of the locally experienced flood; and take action, as well as call others to action, to ameliorate climate and environmental problems in their own lives and communities. We discuss the implications these findings have for environmental and disaster education, policies, and practices.

Eleven influencing indexes including annual maximum 3-day rainfall and rainfall in flood season are selected, and the virtual sown area of crops is innovated. Taking the Huaihe River Basin (HRB) as the research area, the flood risk prediction of the basin is explored by using the long short-term memory (LSTM). The results show that LSTM can be successfully applied to flood risk prediction. The short-term prediction results of the model are good, and the area where the risk is seriously underestimated (the high and very high risk are identified as the very low risk) accounts for only 0.98% of the total basin on average. The prediction results can be used as a reference for watershed management organizations, so as to guide future flood disaster prevention.

Presently, a case study has been undertaken to demonstrate a methodology for FFA considering nonstationarity of annual maximum flood series of six gauging sites from Narmada River Basin. Two different approaches, namely time-varying nonstationarity and nonstationarity due to physical covariates, have been applied in the present case. The influence of climate indices and the effect of reservoir constructions on the Narmada River Basin have been included as external covariates. The results indicated that the construction of reservoirs has played a major role for the changing behavior of flood series of Narmada River Basin from stationary to nonstationary. Due to nonstationarity, the return level flood value increased substantially with time and may create problems for the old structures, which were designed using traditional FFA assumptions of stationarity. The present case study can be used as an alternative to the stationary FFA for any basins worldwide, which will provide more options to the designers and managers.

Traditionally, scholars estimated this lag effect by considering the immediate prior lag (e.g., where vegetation in the current month is impacted by the climate in a certain prior month) or the lag accumulation (e.g., where vegetation in the current month is impacted by the last several months). The essence of these two methods is that vegetation growth is impacted by climate conditions in the prior period or several consecutive previous periods, which fails to consider the different impacts coming from each of those prior periods. Therefore, this study proposed a new approach, the weighted time-lag method, in detecting the lag effect of climate conditions coming from different prior periods. Essentially, the new method is a generalized extension of the lag-accumulation method. However, the new method detects how many prior periods need to be considered and, most importantly, the differentiated climate impact on vegetation growth in each of the determined prior periods. We tested the performance of the new method in the Loess Plateau by comparing various lag detection methods by using the linear model between the climate factors and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The case study confirmed four main findings: (1) the response of vegetation growth exhibits time lag to both precipitation and temperature; (2) there are apparent differences in the time lag effect detected by various methods, but the weighted time-lag method produced the highest determination coefficient (R-2) in the linear model and provided the most specific lag pattern over the determined prior periods; (3) the vegetation growth is most sensitive to climate factors in the current month and the last month in the Loess Plateau but reflects a varied of responses to other prior months; and (4) the impact of temperature on vegetation growth is higher than that of precipitation. The new method provides a much more precise detection of the lag effect of climate change on vegetation growth and makes a smart decision about soil conservation and ecological restoration after severe climate events, such as long-lasting drought or flooding.

Exploring the source supply of evaporation and transportation processes for the precipitation in the HMR can help us understand regional precipitation characteristics and provide valuable insights regarding effective water resource management, disaster prevention, and mitigation. Based on the ERA5 reanalysis data, we identified the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds of the HMR, using the Water Accounting Model-2layer, to investigate the potential mechanisms that drive the changes in the precipitation in the HMR, in terms of external moisture contribution and local recycling. The identified precipitationshed in the HMR varied in response to different types of precipitation during the different seasons. The decrease in the annual precipitation was mainly attributed to the reduced moisture supply from the extended southwest (SW) and northwest (NW) regions, portraying a decreasing trend of -2.08 mm/yr/yr and -0.92 mm/yr/yr, respectively. The detected difference in the moisture sources and transport pathways, in terms of the response of wet and dry precipitation years, can improve our understanding of the moisture patterns of wet and dry years. We could conclude that the increase in moisture from the SW regions, due to El Nin similar to o, may have triggered the heavy precipitation in the HMR in 1998. Additionally, the reduction in moisture from the SW regions, due to La Nin similar to a, may have triggered an extreme drought in the HMR in 2011. Notably, woodland and water surface expansion tend to weaken local recycling (-0.07 %/yr) after 2000. In the future, the decreasing trend of local recycling will likely be intensified owing to large-scale artificial reservoir construction and the surface changes caused by underlying impoundment.

Their highest density and diversity can be found in hot drylands, ecosystems which demonstrate extreme climatic conditions. However, reptiles are not isolated systems but part of a large species assemblage with many trophic dependencies. While direct relations among climatic conditions, invertebrates, vegetation, or reptiles have already been explored, to our knowledge, species' responses to direct and indirect pathways of multiple climatic and biotic factors and their interactions have rarely been examined comprehensively. We investigated direct and indirect effects of climatic and biotic parameters on the individual (body condition) and population level (occupancy) of eight abundant lizard species with different functional traits in an arid Australian lizard community using a 30-yr multi-trophic monitoring study. We used structural equation modeling to disentangle single and interactive effects. We then assessed whether species could be grouped into functional groups according to their functional traits and their responses to different parameters. We found that lizard species differed strongly in how they responded to climatic and biotic factors. However, the factors to which they responded seemed to be determined by their functional traits. While responses on body condition were determined by habitat, activity time, and prey, responses on occupancy were determined by habitat specialization, body size, and longevity. Our findings highlight the importance of indirect pathways through climatic and biotic interactions, which should be included into predictive models to increase accuracy when predicting species' responses to climate change. Since one might never obtain all mechanistic pathways at the species level, we propose an approach of identifying relevant species traits that help grouping species into functional groups at different ecological levels, which could then be used for predictive modeling.

Using the scenario-neutral approach to impact assessment the sensitivity of Irish catchments to fluvial flooding is examined in the context of national climate change allowances. A predefined sensitivity domain is used to quantify flood responses to +2 degrees C mean annual temperature with incremental changes in the seasonality and mean of the annual precipitation cycle. The magnitude of the 20-year flood is simulated at each increment using two rainfall-runoff models (GR4J, NAM), then concatenated as response surfaces for 35 sample catchments. A typology of catchment sensitivity is developed using clustering and discriminant analysis of physical attributes. The same attributes are used to classify 215 ungauged/data-sparse catchments. To address possible redundancies, the exposure of different catchment types to projected climate is established using an objectively selected subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Hydrological model uncertainty is shown to significantly influence sensitivity and have a greater effect than ensemble bias. A national flood risk allowance of 20%, considering all 215 catchments is shown to afford protection against 48% to 98% of the uncertainty in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 subset (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; 2070-2099), irrespective of hydrological model and catchment type. However, results indicate that assuming a standard national or regional allowance could lead to local over/under adaptation. Herein, catchments with relatively less storage are sensitive to seasonal amplification in the annual cycle of precipitation and warrant special attention. Plain Language Summary Climate change presents a significant challenge for flood managers. Their decisions regarding the designation of vulnerable areas and investment in large-scale flood prevention and relief schemes have long-term implications for the attendant risk to human life and infrastructure. In some jurisdictions authorities have proposed a universal allowance on existing design measures that would offer protection against a set (e.g., 20%) increase in flood magnitude. However, this one size fits all approach ignores that river catchments have very different physical attributes that affect their sensitivity to change. We develop a framework that groups catchments based on their physical characteristics into distinct sensitivity types. The method follows the scenario-neutral approach to impact assessment. Here two-dimensional response surfaces showing flood sensitivity to incremental changes in rainfall and temperature are used in conjunction with the latest climate projections to tailor climate plans for individual catchments. The response surfaces are a valuable tool for identifying critical thresholds when proposed allowances fail to accommodate projected flood risk. For managers this helps to allocate resources where risk is greatest and balance the costs of increased protection against climate uncertainty. The study is conducted using 215 Irish catchments; however, we highlight its potential to aid adaptation efforts globally.

Jasmonic acid is required for tomato acclimation to multifactorial stress combination	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Climate change; Multifactorial stress combination; Photosynthesis; Phytohormones; Jasmonic acid; Tomato	PROLINE ACCUMULATION; ARABIDOPSIS; TOLERANCE; DROUGHT; DEHYDROGENASE; PROTECTION; REMOVAL; PLANTS	As a result of global warming and climate change, the number and intensity of weather events such as droughts, heat waves, and floods are increasing, resulting in major losses in crop yield worldwide. Combined with the accumulation of different pollutants, this situation is leading to a gradual increase in the complexity of environmental factors affecting plants. We recently used the term 'multifactorial stress combination' (MFSC) to describe the impact of three or more stressors occurring simultaneously or sequentially on plants. Here, we show that a MFSC of six different abiotic stressors (high light, heat, nitrogen deficiency, paraquat, cadmium, and salinity) has a negative impact on the growth, photosystem II function, and photosynthetic activity of mature tomato plants. We further reveal a negative correlation between proline accumulation and the increasing number of stress factors combined, suggesting that proline could have an adverse effect on plants during MFSC. Our findings further indicate that alterations in hormonal levels and stomatal responses are stress/stress combinationdependent, and that a tomato mutant deficient in jasmonic acid accumulation is more sensitive to high light and its combinations with salinity and/or paraquat. Taken together, our study reveals that the effects of MFSC on tomato plants are broad, that photosynthesis and proline accumulation are especially vulnerable to MFSC, and that jasmonic acid is required for tomato acclimation to MFSCs involving high light, salinity and paraquat.

A 120.8 m drilled core (SHBZK-1) was recovered to determine the late Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, sedimentary environment and their coevolutionary relationship. Laboratory analysis, including grain size distribution, magnetic susceptibility, and optical stimulated luminescence dating, was carried out. Lithofacies and grain size showed that the sediments are of fluvial origin and contain two subfaces: river sand bar and flood plain. The good correlation between magnetic susceptibility and grain size show that climate change is the main factor controlling the variation of sedimentary environment in Hebei Plain, rather than tectonic factors. Furthermore, variations of the magnetic susceptibility and lithofacies reflect the intensity and fluctuations of Asian monsoons and couple well with glacial-interglacial cycles, suggesting that the variation of ice volume in the Northern Hemisphere drives climate change in the Hebei Plain, which, in turn, regulates the variation of the sedimentary environment and facies through controlling precipitation changes, as well as the input amount of magnetic minerals. This research provides a useful continental archive for understanding the late Pleistocene environmental and climatic variation and suggests the prevalence of climate-driven environmental change.

However, due to the significant variations in their efficiencies and site-specific requirements, an optimal combination of different LIDs is required to benefit from their full potential. In this article, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) was coupled with the stormwater management model (SWMM) to identify both hydrological and cost-effective LIDs combinations within a large urban watershed. MOGA iteratively optimizes the types, sizes, and locations of different LIDs using a combined cost- and runoff-related objective function under both past and future stormwater conditions. The infiltration trench (IT), rain barrel (RB), rain gardens (RG), bioretention (BR), and permeable pavement were used as potential LIDs since they are common in our study area-the city of Renton, WA, USA. The city is currently adapting different LIDs to mitigate the recent increase in stormwater system failures and flooding. The results from our study showed that the optimum combination of LIDs in the city could reduce the peak flow and total runoff volume by up to 62.25% and 80% for past storms and by13% and 29% for future storms, respectively. The findings and methodologies presented in this study are expected to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the performance of large-scale implementations of LIDs.

The significance and functions of ethylene in flooding stress tolerance in plants	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Review						Ethylene; Flood tolerance; Phytohormones; ROS; SUB1; Submergence	LYSIGENOUS AERENCHYMA FORMATION; EPIDERMAL-CELL DEATH; RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; CONFERS SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; INDUCED PETIOLE ELONGATION; END RULE PATHWAY; DEEP-WATER RICE; LEAF GAS FILMS; RUMEX-PALUSTRIS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR	Climate change has increased the global environmental risks, especially the impacts of abiotic stresses on agriculture productivity. Among the abiotic stresses aggravated by climate change, flooding (complete submergence, stagnant flooding, soil waterlogging) has been identified as a major stress for plant growth and food production worldwide. Improving crop plants adaptation to flooding conditions is important to cope with increasing incidences and intensity of flooding, which could potentially be accomplished through manipulating adaptive physiological and molecular processes. Ethylene is a key plant hormone in plant adaptation to flooding, modulating signaling, and metabolic responses. Significant progress was made in understanding the basic physiological and molecular mechanisms associated with ethylene-mediated plant responses to flooding stress, though our knowledge in this field is still far from complete. This review provided (a) an overview of ethylene biosynthesis, signaling and its perception under flood condition in plants, with emphasis on rice; (b) assess the ethylene functions under flooding stress based on available evidences; (c) cross-talks of ethylene with other phytohormones and signaling molecules associated with ethylene-induced flooding responses; and (d) elucidate the role of ethylene mediated tolerance pathways with an aim of developing flood tolerant plants. The review represents a step forward to develop flood resilient crop plants by exploiting the knowledge of ethylene biology and functions.	[Khan, M.

Because of spatial variability in monsoonal rainfall, our knowledge about climate change during the mid- to late-Holocene in southern China is still limited. We present a multi-proxy record of paleoclimatic change in a crater lake, Lake Shuangchi. Based on the age-depth model from Pb-210, Cs-137 and AMS(14)C data, high-resolution mid- to late- Holocene climatic and environmental records were reconstructed using multiple indices (TOC, TN, C/N, delta C-13 and grain size). Shuangchi underwent a marked change from a peat bog to a lake around 1.4 kaBP. The C-3 plants likely dominated during 7.0-5.9 ka and 2.5-1.4 kaBP, while C-4 plants dominated between 5.9-3.2 and 3.0-2.5 kaBP. Algae were dominant sources of organic matter in the lake sediments after 1.4 kaBP. Several intervals with high concentrations of coarser grain sizes might be due to flood events. These results reveal that several abrupt paleoclimatic events occurred around 6.6 ka, 6.1 ka, 5.9 ka, 3.0 ka, 2.5 ka and 1.4 kaBP. The paleoclimatic change recorded in the lake may be related to the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity.

Urban stormwater management using low-impact development control measures considering climate change	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF	This work simulates rainfall using the GFDL-ESM2G large-scale model (from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5)) and the change-factor method to downscale rainfall under three emission scenarios: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is applied to simulate stormwater driven by rainfall inputs in zones 1 and 3 of the northeastern municipality of Tehran under baseline (1988-2005), near-future (2030-2047), and far-future (2048-2065) conditions. The results indicate that the rainfall intensity for the design event with a 50-year return period would increase in the near future (2030-2047) and far future (2048-2065). Deployment of four types of low-impact development (LID) stormwater control measures (SCMs), i.e., vegetative swales, bio-retention cells, permeable pavement, and infiltration trenches for urban stormwater control in the study area, shows that there would be a significant change between the "with LID SCMs" condition and the "without LID SCMs" condition with respect to the flood volume at the basin outlet. The LID SCMs would reduce the flood volume in the near future by 22%, 23%, and 21% under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively, and they would reduce the flood volume in the far future by 23%, 27%, and 23% under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively.

Previous studies have identified the necessity to develop decision-making tools for SUDS in order to adequately implement these structures. This study proposes a simulation-optimization methodology that aims to ease the decision-making process when selecting and placing SUDS, with the specific goal of managing urban flooding. The methodology was applied to a real case study in Dresden, Germany. The most relevant variables when selecting SUDS were the spatial distribution of floods and the land uses in the catchment. Furthermore, the rainfall characteristics played an important role when selecting the different SUDS configurations. After the optimal SUDS configurations were determined, flood maps were developed, identifying the high potential that SUDS have for reducing flood volumes and depth, but showing them to be quite limited in reducing the flooded areas. The final section of the study proposes a combined frequency map of SUDS implementation, which is suggested for use as a final guide for the present study. The study successfully implemented a novel methodology that included land-use patterns and flood indicators to select SUDS in a real case study.

This study summarizes research findings from eight South Asian countries based on a scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature (critically evaluated) published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2021. We have included multiple dimensions of climate change such as drought, floods, cyclones, tsunamis, storms, raised temperature/heatwaves, heavy rainfall, rising sea level, and glacier melt-related extreme weather events. Findings suggest Extreme Weather Events (EWE) affect adolescents and their wellbeing in various ways, with adolescent girls disproportionately harmed, as EWE are linked to early marriage, trafficking, gender based sexual and physical violence. Regional variation suggested, with Bangladeshi adolescents most vulnerable to EWE, followed by India and Pakistan. Floods, droughts and cyclones are the most commonly reported EWE affecting adolescents in the South Asian region. As the climate crisis is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of EWE, it will be critical to understand the gender sensitive impacts in more in-depth and find more sustainable solutions for the global problem that is adversely impacting the adolescent's life, wellbeing, and development.

J	Arinabo, D				Arinabo, Denis			Unveiling the role of contextual factors in the evolution of urban floods in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons from Kampala city	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Contextual factors; Urban flooding; Poor waste disposal; Informal settlements; Wetland loss	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; INFORMALITY; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; GROWTH; CITIES; POOR	The understanding of the changing nature of recurrent and widespread urban flood risks across the rapidly urbanising Sub-Saharan African cities has, for long, been overshadowed by more general factors such as rainfall intensity, insufficient drainage systems, occupation of floodplains and, more recently, the climate change praxis. Yet, the impact of context-specific conditions on urban flood risks is still surrounded by ambiguity across the existing empirical research, policy and political arena. This research seeks to unveil the missing links regarding how contextual drivers of urban flood risks are understood across urban actors. Using Kampala city as the case study area, this research adopts multi-methods such as key informant semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, GIS and policy reviews to gather relevant empirical data. The findings indicate that a) the nature of urban flooding is dictated by the level of interaction between socioeconomic, institutional, environmental and infrastructural factors and b) the negligence, ambiguity and inconsistency that characterise the institutional policy landscape plays a vital role in the co-evolution of urban flood hotspots. Overall, this research contributes to an in-depth understanding of the role of multiple context-specific urban conditions in urban flooding, a fundamental prerequisite for designing robust approaches to flood management.

Household Migration and Intentions for Future Migration in the Climate Change Vulnerable Lower Meghna Estuary of Coastal Bangladesh	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						household migration; flash flood; coastal vulnerability; bangladesh	PLACE ATTACHMENT; MOBILITY; ADAPTATION; REFUGEES; RISK	Coastal residents of Bangladesh are now confronted with the increased incidence, variability, and severity of weather-related hazards and disasters due to climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR). Many researchers hold the view that as a consequence residents of such area have either already migrated to inland locations or intend to so in the near future. We examine the migration of households following a flash flood event that took place in August 2020 and address intentions for future migration in the Lower Meghna Estuary of coastal Bangladesh. The data obtained for this study include 310 household surveys, field observations, and informal discussions with respondents and local people. Based on the analysis of the field data, this empirical research found one household migrated to other district within one year after the event. When the respondents were asked about their future migration intensions, only a tiny proportion, namely 21 (6.77%) households, likely will leave the study area to settle in other districts while the remaining 289 households likely will stay in the Lakshmipur district. This finding challenges the existing narratives about vulnerability to environmentally induced migration. Moreover, it provides evidence of non-migration, which is a new as well as thriving area of investigation in relation to coastal Bangladesh.

A medium-sized town in central Poland which is supplied with consumption water from both underground water intakes and surface water resources was selected as a case study. Natural hazards, such as droughts or floods, were identified and the risk of the occurrence of natural hazards concerning water supply systems assessed. The findings of the archived data analysis for the period 1971-2020 helped to identify extreme circumstances, the occurrence of which had an impact on secure water supplies in terms of quantity. Moreover, the results obtained indicate that the greatest influence had all the situations connected with the Drweca low water discharge, which in the long term could lead to temporary water shortages. In the analyzed period, there was a significant increase in the number of days without precipitation, together with a statistically significant increase in the average annual air temperature. Meteorological hazards related to days without precipitation far outweighed the occurrence of days with intense precipitation. The analysis of water table fluctuations observed at the Jedwabno infiltration intake showed a high sensitivity of the aquifer to atmospheric conditions.

Adequacy assessment of an urban drainage system considering future land use and climate change scenario	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						catchment delineation; climate change; Hatirjheel-Begunbari canal; land use; stormwater runoff; waterlogging	CHANGE IMPACTS; URBANIZATION; CITY; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has been experiencing severe water-logging and urban flooding in the last few decades. In this paper, we estimate the peak storm runoff of Hatirjheel-Begunbari canal - the largest drainage system of the city - under different operational, land use and climate scenarios (2013, 2025 and 2040). Our method includes digital elevation model (DEM) reconditioning, watershed delineation, and development of future land use scenario. We apply HEC-RAS to check the adequacy of Begunbari canal cross-sections to carry peak runoff for the scenarios considered here. The Hatirjheel-Begunbari system is found to drain stormwater from similar to 25% of the city. Within the system, built-up areas are increasing linearly by 0.8 Km(2)/year, whereas water body and wetlands are decreasing exponentially, which might increase the runoff coefficient by 11% in 2040 relative to 2013. Climate-induced change in rainfall intensity along with land-use change show three times higher runoff in 2040 than in 2013. Around 58% of canal cross-sections appear to be overflown at both banks while carrying a 5-year return period peak runoff under the 2013 scenario. For future scenarios, all sections seem to cause an overflow, which is alarming.	[Afrin, S.; Islam, M. M.; Rahman, M.

In response, policy makers and academics are seeking strategies to build public support for coastal adaptation, which requires a deeper understanding of peoples' preferences for coastal adaptation and what motives those preferences. Here, we conduct a systematic literature review to understand preferences for coastal adaptation options and the factors influencing these preferences. Ninety peer-reviewed publications meet the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that hard protection options were often the most frequently preferred, likely due to a desire to maintain current shoreline, for the protection of recreational spaces and private property, and a perceived effectiveness of hard protection options. Soft protection, including nature-based approaches, accommodation, and no action were the next most preferred options. Finally, retreat options were the least preferred, often due to strong place attachment. We identify twenty-eight factors that could influence preferences, with risk perception, place attachment, and financial considerations occurring most frequently in the literature. In the conclusion, we outline the most significant research gaps identified from our analysis and discuss the implication for adaptation research and practice.

Structured questionnaires on coping and adaptation strategies were conducted among Nyangatom households, expounded by focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Correlations between times series (1987-2016) on rainfall, temperature and the local perceptions on CC were examined. The time series analysis confirmed pastoralists' perception that the frequency of extreme drought has increased since 1987. The Nyangatom responded by temporal migration and herd diversification. Other responses include flood cultivation and enhancing alliance formation with other ethnic groups. Multi-nominal logistic regression analyses indicated that age of household head (-), livestock ownership (+), crop productivity (+), off-farm income (+) and access to climate information (+) proved to be key determinants with a statistically significant (negative or positive) effect on adoption. Other factors that hindered climate change adaption include intermittent conflicts with neighbouring ethnic groups and limited access to alternative livelihood options. Interventions to facilitate transition towards sustainable, adaptation-based communities need to incorporate deliberate, longer-term, risk-reducing strategies, including rangeland management, water harvesting and small scale-irrigation schemes. Improved education access, extension services, and a conducive pastoral policy environment will help to enhance the Nyangatom adaptive capacity.

The famous sediment-laden Yellow River in China has also had a declining sediment load in the past decades. This study made a quantitative ascription of the sediment discharge changes by non-parametric Pettitt test, rainfall and sediment discharge characteristic index calculation, correlation test, double cumulative curve regression and solving differential equation in the Huangfu and the Kuye basins in the main sediment sources of the Yellow River. The results indicated that: (1) The sediment discharge decreased significantly from 1956 to 2016, while the rainfall and rainfall erosivity only had a visible but insignificant decreasing trend. (2) Rainfall erosivity is better than other rainfall characteristic indexes in relation with sediment discharge. (3) The anthropogenic factor was the main driver for the reduction of sediment discharge with a percentage of 70.2-90.5% in different periods. The contribution of rainfall changes in flood season to sediment discharge reduction surpassed that in the whole year. (4) A percentage of 88% and 93% of suspended sediment yield reduction was attributed to streamflow reduction, and 12% and 7% to changes in C-Q relationship in the Huangfu and the Kuye basins, respectively.

A total of ten number of meteorological stations with hundred years of observed data are considered for trend analysis. Two non-parametric methods, Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's Slope (SS) estimator, are applied for detection of direction and magnitude of the trend. From the trend analysis, it is found that both the annual as well as seasonal temperature (Tmax and Tmin) are increasing since a couple of decades. Also, it is observed that the average rate of increase in temperature is more in Tmin as compared to Tmax. The decreasing trend of annual and seasonal precipitation pattern is found where negative trends are significant in the monsoon P series with a confidence interval of 95%. The potential evapotranspiration showed increasing trend significantly in monsoon season. Change point analysis is also done to know the shift of trend of meteorological variables. This study gives a fair idea about the variation of meteorological parameters which may be used for climate change analysis as well as sustainable watershed management.

As climate change disrupts weather patterns and wreaks havoc on crops, the need for generating stress-resilient, high-yielding varieties is more urgent than ever. One extremely promising avenue in this regard is to exploit the tremendous genetic diversity expressed by the wild ancestors of current day crop species. These crop wild relatives thrive in a range of environments and accordingly often harbor an array of traits that allow them to do so. The identification and introgression of these traits into our staple cereal crops can lessen yield losses in stressful environments. In the last decades, a surge in extreme drought and flooding events have severely impacted cereal crop production. Climate models predict a persistence of this trend, thus reinforcing the need for research on water stress resilience. Here we review: (i) how water stress (drought and flooding) impacts crop performance; and (ii) how identification of tolerance traits and mechanisms from wild relatives of the main cereal crops, that is, rice, maize, wheat, and barley, can lead to improved survival and sustained yields in these crops under water stress conditions.

Lessons learnt from Typhoons <i>Fitow</i> and <i>In-Fa</i>: implications for improving urban flood resilience in Asian Coastal Cities	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Typhoon; Climate change; Resilience; Big data; Social media	SEA-LEVEL RISE; DELTA; CITY	Frequent typhoons significantly affect many coastal cities via intensive rainstorms, tidal surges and strong wind. Natural factors induced by human disturbance such as climate change and sea-level rise come alongside anthropogenic factors such as rapid urbanisation and land use/land cover change, leading to detrimental consequences such as urban floods. This short communication offers various lessons learnt by Ningbo municipality from two strong typhoons that hit the city directly, namely Fitow in 2013 and In-Fa in 2021. On the one hand, usage of "Big Data" and "Social Media" for better "Preparation" and "Prevention" reduced flood impacts noticeably. On the other hand, implementation of "Flood Insurance" sped up the "Recovery" processes. The successful "Preparation", "Response" and "Recovery" helped Ningbo to enhance its flood resilience, and thus to reduce or avoid substantial impacts of injuries, household damages and the associated economic loss. These three key terms should be heeded in typhoon/flood governance in which various stakeholders are involved, and be incorporated into the city's long-term strategic development plans to merge with the climate actions towards the 2030s and beyond. This will be vitally important in reducing climatic hazards and improving coastal flood resilience under the future climatic uncertainties in Asian coastal cities.

However, the plant functional responses to various precipitation regimes remain unclear. Here, greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine how maize plant functional traits respond to drought, flooding and rewatering. Drought and flooding hampered photosynthetic capacity, particularly when severe and/or prolonged. Most photosynthetic traits recovered after rewatering, with few compensatory responses. Rewatering often elicited high photosynthetic resilience in plants exposed to severe drought at the end of plant development, with the response strongly depending on the drought severity/duration. The associations of chlorophyll concentrations with photosynthetically functional activities were stronger during post-tasseling than pre-tasseling, implying an involvement of leaf age/senescence in responses to episodic drought and subsequent rewatering. Coordinated changes in chlorophyll content, gas exchange, fluorescence parameters (PSII quantum efficiency and photochemical/non-photochemical radiative energy dissipation) possibly contributed to the enhanced drought resistance and resilience and suggested a possible regulative trade-off. These findings provide fundamental insights into how plants regulate their functional traits to deal with sporadic alterations in precipitation. Breeding and management of plants with high resistance and resilience traits could help crop production under future climate change.

Privatizing climate adaptation: How insurance weakens solidaristic and collective disaster recovery	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						adaptation; climate change; disaster; extreme weather; insurance; social legitimacy	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; POSTDISASTER RECOVERY; RESPONSIBILITY; RESILIENCE; POLICY; VULNERABILITY; CONSEQUENCES; RESPONSES; WEATHER; PLACE	As losses from extreme weather events grow, many governments are looking to privatize the financing and incentivization of climate adaptation through insurance markets. In a pure market approach to insurance for extreme weather events, individuals become responsible for ensuring they are adequately covered for risks to their own properties, and governments no longer contribute funds to post-disaster recovery. Theoretically, insurance premiums signal the level of risk faced by each household, and incentivize homeowners to invest in adaptive action, such as retrofitting, or drainage work, to reduce premiums. Where risk is considered too high by insurance markets, housing is devalued, in theory leading to retreat from risky areas. In this review article, we evaluate the suitability of private insurance as a mechanism for climate adaptation at a household and community level. We find a mismatch between social understandings of responsibility for climate risks, and the technocratic, market-based home insurance products offered by private insurance markets. We suggest that by constructing increasingly individualized, technical, and calculative evaluations of risk, market-based models of insurance for extreme weather events erode the solidaristic and collective discourses and practices that support adaptive behavior.

Because research on climate change has indicated that similar extreme disasters are expected to become more frequent, this study investigated adaptation projects for mitigating the impact of such disasters in the future. It used Typhoon Morakot as an example and applied the pseudo-global warming method for simulating the impact of a Morakot-level typhoon plus warming effects to analyze the flood losses caused by increasing precipitation. For this study, Tainan City, a city severely damaged by Typhoon Morakot in 2009, was chosen as a demonstration area to evaluate the optimal adaptation measures by cost-benefit analysis methods. The results showed that the precipitation will increase as much as 60% in the Tainan region at the end of this century and that in the future the inundation area in Tainan will see a 10.4% increase beyond the flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot. Fifteen combinations of adaptation projects were provided to reduce future flood losses. Finally, a composite adaptation project combining riverbed dredging and improved plans for evacuation and sheltering was determined to be the optimal option, as it could create a net benefit of as much as 27 million US dollars in the 60years of engineering service life for Tainan City.

Trends of Streamflow under climate change for 26 Brazilian basins	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrological modelling; Rainfall; River basins; Streamflow; Water resources; Brazil	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTH-AMERICA; WATER POLICY; MODEL	Changes in the climate system and the hydrologic regime strongly affect all water uses and human activity. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of rainfall pattern change on streamflow for 26 Brazilian basins with hydropower plants. More precisely, the goal is to estimate the trends on average streamflow for the 2011-2100 period. The estimated trends result from the analysis of rainfall obtained from a possible climate scenario, among others. The annual average streamflow for this 90-year period is simulated and compared with records from 83 years of observations (1931-2013). Simulations were carried out using two rainfall-to-streamflow hydrological models: Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure (SMAP) and Stochastic Linear Model (SLM). Results from simulations show important impacts, namely, an increase of streamflow in the southern basins and a decrease in the northern basins. Such changes can lead to disastrous consequences, considering the historical exposure to floods and droughts in the southern and northeast regions, respectively. These findings, in addition to the recent severe drought events that have occurred in such regions, provide awareness of a new cycle of reform to the existing water policies and Brazilian institutional framework, which saw the completion of its first 20 years in 2017.

Dynamics of Suspended Particulate Matter in an Impounded River Under Dry and Wet Weather Conditions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						suspended particulate matter; organic matter; biologically mediated flocculation; deposition and resuspension; climate change; human intervention	SETTLING VELOCITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; PARTICLE-SIZE; LC-OCD; SEDIMENT; FLOCCULATION; WATER; FLUX; KINETICS; DEPOSITION	The dynamics of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and SPM-associated biological and physicochemical processes in a river vary under dry and wet weather conditions and hydraulic structures, which moves a free-flowing river to a semi-lacustrine environment. This study investigated the response of SPM dynamics and riverbed morphodynamics to climate and anthropogenic stressors based on in-situ observations and biogeochemical analyses of river water and riverbed sediment. The biochemical analyses and flocculation tests demonstrate abundant biopolymers and high flocculation potential of the river water during the pre-flood period with algal bloom. This might promote SPM deposition and high-concentration sediment layer (HCSL) formation on the riverbed. The high fractions of clay minerals and organic carbon in the riverbed sediment indicate the deposition of organic-rich biomineral flocs. Vertical turbidity profiles with "long tails" of high turbidity near the riverbed also confirmed SPM deposition and HCSL formation. However, the highly turbulent flow conditions during the post-flood period disturbed the tails of high turbidity and homogenized the vertical profiles of turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Additionally, terrestrial humic substances were discharged from the watershed during this period, increasing the deflocculation and stabilization of SPM but decreasing deposition on the riverbed, thereby reducing the fractions of clay minerals and organic carbon in the sediment. This study demonstrated the interaction mechanism of SPM dynamics and riverbed morphodynamics with hydrological and biogeochemical processes in an impounded river under dry and wet weather conditions. The findings provide insights into water resource management to deal with climate change and anthropogenic stressors.	[Huynh, T. T.; Kim, W.; Lee, B.

Monitoring the evolution of sustainability and well-being in the cities is important for researchers implementing the UN 2030 Agenda. This research explores and analyzes the climate change hazards, adaptation- and mitigation actions and their implementation in 776 cities located in 84 different countries. The climate action co-benefits are supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals, which are comprehensively elaborated in this methodological development. The analyzes are carried out based on the continuously updated Carbon Disclosure Project database. An open source algorithm has been developed that represents the CDP database as a bit table and use frequent itemset mining for the identification of global patterns of climate hazards, mitigation- and adaptation actions and their co-benefits, therefore, this paper offers an exploratory analysis tool that is suitable for monitoring climate actions. The most frequently identified mitigation actions in cities were energy planting (1444 actions), and on-site renewable production (644), while the most common actions for adaptation were tree planting (283) and flood mapping (267). Regarding city size, 41% of large metropolitan areas plan to develop mass transit actions, while the separate collection of recyclables is typical in 85% of towns. 56.2% of CDP database actions support access to sustainable cities and communities goal (SDG11), 54.2% access to climate action goal (SDG13), and the emergence of affordable and clean energy (SDG7) and gender equality goal (SDG5) are below 5%.

However, there has been limited dissemination of accurate prediction of extreme precipitation based on analysis of spatio-temporal characteristics of such events. In this study, the intra-annual distribution of extreme precipitation was subjected to scrutiny via an analysis of precipitation concentration degree (PCD) and precipitation concentration period (PCP), while also investigating the spatio-temporal trends of the annual precipitation, maximum daily precipitation, maximum 5-day precipitation, and extreme precipitation (defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th percentile of the total precipitation). Furthermore, subsequently, conducting simulation, verification, and prediction of extreme precipitation was achieved through the application of a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). This study employed the data of the daily precipitation in the Dongjiang River Basin from 1979 to 2022, a time period which was of sufficient length to reflect the latest changes in precipitation patterns. The results demonstrated spatio-temporal differences between precipitation levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River Basin, that is, the PCD of the lower reach was higher and the PCP of the lower reach came half a month later compared with the upper reach. Moreover, the extreme precipitation indices increased from northeast to southwest, with the characteristics of lower-reach precipitation being more extreme and periodic. It was predicted that the total precipitation in 2023 would decrease, while the extreme precipitation would increase. The qualification rate of forecasting extreme precipitation ranged from 27% to 72%.

Management of Climate Resilience: Exploring the Potential of Digital Twin Technology, 3D City Modelling, and Early Warning Systems	SENSORS			English	Review						digital twin; early warning system; smart cities; coastal climate change; 3D city modelling; virtual cities; real-time sensors	SOCIAL MEDIA; FLOOD RISK; FRAMEWORK; LANDSLIDE; PLATFORM; SERVICE; GIS; VISUALIZATION; RESOLUTION; DESIGN	Cities, and in particular those in coastal low-lying areas, are becoming increasingly susceptible to climate change, the impact of which is worsened by the tendency for population concentration in these areas. Therefore, comprehensive early warning systems are necessary to minimize harm from extreme climate events on communities. Ideally, such a system would allow all stakeholders to acquire accurate up-to-date information and respond effectively. This paper presents a systematic review that highlights the significance, potential, and future directions of 3D city modelling, early warning systems, and digital twins in the creation of technology for building climate resilience through the effective management of smart cities. In total, 68 papers were identified through the PRISMA approach. A total of 37 case studies were included, among which (n = 10) define the framework for a digital twin technology, (n = 14) involve the design of 3D virtual city models, and (n = 13) entail the generation of early warning alerts using the real-time sensor data. This review concludes that the bidirectional flow of data between a digital model and the real physical environment is an emerging concept for enhancing climate resilience. However, the research is primarily in the phase of theoretical concepts and discussion, and numerous research gaps remain regarding the implementation and use of a bidirectional data flow in a true digital twin. Nonetheless, ongoing innovative research projects are exploring the potential of digital twin technology to address the challenges faced by communities in vulnerable areas, which will hopefully lead to practical solutions for enhancing climate resilience in the near future.

However, it is now known that the climate is changing at a rate that calls into question the stationarity assumption. This study was undertaken to explore various methods of accounting for climate nonstationarity. The geographical domain of this study covers most of Canada, intending to explore how best to update future climatic variables in the National Building Code of Canada (NBC). Outputs from future climate simulations for North America by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) were used, focusing on a representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, namely the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. Surface hourly mean wind speeds and ground snow amounts were extracted from the simulations and used to detect and quantify trends in the extreme climatic variables from 1950 through 2100. This study reviewed different concepts for evaluating climatic design variables under stationary and nonstationary climates. It was found that within the range of linear nonstationarity detected for grid points within Canada, the results predicted using these nonstationary methods are close. Therefore, a simpler approach, namely Minimax design life level, was adopted to estimate the design wind speeds for 1/50 and 1/500 annual probability of exceedance and the design ground snow loads for 1/50 and 1/1,000 annual probability of exceedance. Design values derived based on nonstationary approaches were compared with the results estimated using the conventional return period concept between 1986 and 2016 and a moving-time-window method between 2060 and 2090 centered at 2075.

The delimitation of flood zones by detailed mapping generally makes it possible to avoid human and economic losses, especially in regions at high risk of flooding. The Taguenit basin, located in southern Morocco, is a particular case. The mapping of the flood zones of this basin by the method of the Flood Hazard Index (FHI) in a GIS geographic information systems environment was based on the multi-criteria analysis, taking into consideration the seven parameters influencing these extreme phenomena, namely rainfall, slope, flow accumulation, drainage network density, distance from rivers, permeability, and land use. Average annual rainfall data for 37 years (1980 to 2016) was used in this study for floodplain mapping. A weight was calculated for each parameter using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The combination of the maps of the different parameters made it possible to draw up a final map classified into five risk intervals: very high, high, moderate, lower and very lower presenting, respectively, 8.04%, 20.63%, 31.47%, 15.36%, and 24.50% of the area of the basin. The reliability of this method was tested by a Flood susceptibility analysis. The results generated by the Flood Hazard Index (FHI) model are similar to those of previous historical events. Realistic and applicable solutions have been proposed to minimize the impact of these floods as much as possible.

Especially, floodplain boundaries have to be defined clearly to prevent new developments in regions under high flood risk. Thus, flood hazard maps play an important role in flood control and urban planning. Alibeykoy Watershed plays a critical role due to the new extensive infrastructure planning in Istanbul, Turkey. Thus, this area is vulnerable to the population growth and urbanization, and needs attention and precaution. In this study, flood hazard map for Alibeykoy Watershed is developed. For this purpose, first, a hydrological model for Alibeykoy Watershed is generated using MIKE Nedbor Afrstromnings Model (NAM). The hydrological model is calibrated by using rainfall, evaporation and flowrate data measured at the field side. Then, the calibrated hydrological model is used to simulate 50 and 100-year flood hydrographs which are used as inputs of the hydraulic models developed for Pirincci Stream by using MIKE 11 and MIKE 21. Finally, flood depth and flood extent map for 50 and 100-year return periods are obtained with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional hydraulic model simulations under unsteady flow conditions. In addition, capabilities of MIKE 11 and MIKE 21 on flood modelling are also revealed. Results show that particularly Arnavutkoy district located along the mid-section of Pirincci Stream is under high flood risk. Therefore, precautions need to be taken in this region in order to decrease the impacts of possible floods in the future.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) in 2021, which stated that with the intensification of global warming, heavy rainfalls are becoming more severe and frequent. Economic development in recent years has also caused the proportion of impervious areas in urban regions to increase with the advancement of urbanization. When the two aforementioned factors are coupled together, the result is faster surface runoff speeds and reduced infiltration rates, which in turn result in worse flooding. Thus, water disaster mitigation is becoming a topic of great importance to developed and developing countries. This study examined five Nature-based Solutions (NbS) cases (A, B C, D, E) for the Nangang river in Taiwan. Case A is to design levees with a 100-year return period flood design standard. Under steady flow conditions, floods can be smoothly discharged downstream without any significant inundation in most situations. Case B and C used gabions with a 10-year return period flood design standard and discontinuous levees with a 25-year return period flood design standard, respectively. Though neither case is as effective in flood mitigation, both cases B and C can still reduce inundation from the flooding disaster relatively well. Case D is to dredge local areas of the main channel, but the steady flow simulation showed little flood mitigation effect. Case E is the implementation of "Room for the River", and employs main channel dredging and floodplain land grading to increase flood conveyance capacity. Case E provides good flood mitigation.

Multiple climate change-driven tipping points for coastal systems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; DISSOLVED INORGANIC NITROGEN; SANDY BEACH; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; MODEL; STORM; CONSEQUENCES; PROJECTIONS; THRESHOLDS; PACIFIC	As the climate evolves over the next century, the interaction of accelerating sea level rise (SLR) and storms, combined with confining development and infrastructure, will place greater stresses on physical, ecological, and human systems along the ocean-land margin. Many of these valued coastal systems could reach "tipping points," at which hazard exposure substantially increases and threatens the present-day form, function, and viability of communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Determining the timing and nature of these tipping points is essential for effective climate adaptation planning. Here we present a multidisciplinary case study from Santa Barbara, California (USA), to identify potential climate change-related tipping points for various coastal systems. This study integrates numerical and statistical models of the climate, ocean water levels, beach and cliff evolution, and two soft sediment ecosystems, sandy beaches and tidal wetlands. We find that tipping points for beaches and wetlands could be reached with just 0.25 m or less of SLR (similar to 2050), with>50% subsequent habitat loss that would degrade overall biodiversity and ecosystem function. In contrast, the largest projected changes in socioeconomic exposure to flooding for five communities in this region are not anticipated until SLR exceeds 0.75 m for daily flooding and 1.5 m for storm-driven flooding (similar to 2100 or later). These changes are less acute relative to community totals and do not qualify as tipping points given the adaptive capacity of communities. Nonetheless, the natural and human built systems are interconnected such that the loss of natural system function could negatively impact the quality of life of residents and disrupt the local economy, resulting in indirect socioeconomic impacts long before built infrastructure is directly impacted by flooding.

However, green roof research and maintenance awareness in Malaysia are comparatively scarce, largely due to the absence of local tropical green roof guidelines. Therefore, this paper aims to explore current green roof maintenance practices and challenges for non-residential buildings in Malaysia through case studies and in-depth interviews. These results were then compared with three international green roof guidelines, namely those of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyor, Singapore's National Parks Board, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The findings show that current green roof maintenance elements implemented in the case studies are insufficient and inadequate for Malaysia's tropical climate conditions. The paper recommends nine (9) green roof maintenance elements specific for non-residential buildings in Malaysia and the tropical climate: plant selection, rainwater harvesting system, pest control, monitoring performance, accessibility, irrigation cleaning, waterproofing membrane maintenance, plants and growing medium, and maintenance of outdoor furniture. As this paper has only included data from Kuala Lumpur, this limits the generalizability of the findings to other buildings in Malaysia and a tropical climate. The implications of this study may provide further direction for researchers to consider a larger sample size and other cities in a tropical climate. This study will allow policymakers and building stakeholders to develop suitable green roof maintenance guidelines.

On a Reef Far, Far Away Anthropogenic Impacts Following Extreme Storms Affect Sponge Health and Bacterial Communities	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Agelas clathrodes; coral reef; flood; Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary; Gulf of Mexico; Hurricane Harvey; bacterial community; Xestospongia muta	GIANT BARREL SPONGE; XESTOSPONGIA-MUTA; CORAL-REEFS; SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS; MICROBIOME; NUTRIENTS; HOLOBIONT; SALINITY; GULF; EAST	Terrestrial runoff can negatively impact marine ecosystems through stressors including excess nutrients, freshwater, sediments, and contaminants. Severe storms, which are increasing with global climate change, generate massive inputs of runoff over short timescales (hours to days); such runoff impacted offshore reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico (NW GoM) following severe storms in 2016 and 2017. Several weeks after coastal flooding from these events, NW GoM reef corals, sponges, and other benthic invertebrates similar to 185 km offshore experienced mortality (2016 only) and/or sublethal stress (both years). To assess the impact of storm-derived runoff on reef filter feeders, we characterized the bacterial communities of two sponges, Agelas clathrodes and Xestospongia muta, from offshore reefs during periods of sub-lethal stress and no stress over a three-year period (2016-2018). Sponge-associated and seawater-associated bacterial communities were altered during both flood years. Additionally, we found evidence of wastewater contamination (based on 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative PCR) in offshore sponge samples, but not in seawater samples, following these flood years. Signs of wastewater contamination were absent during the no-flood year. We show that flood events from severe storms have the capacity to reach offshore reef ecosystems and impact resident benthic organisms. Such impacts are most readily detected if baseline data on organismal physiology and associated microbiome composition are available. This highlights the need for molecular and microbial time series of benthic organisms in near- and offshore reef ecosystems, and the continued mitigation of stormwater runoff and climate change impacts.

J	Khandel, O; Soliman, M				Khandel, Omid; Soliman, Mohamed			Integrated Framework for Assessment of Time-Variant Flood Fragility of Bridges Using Deep Learning Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							REINFORCED-CONCRETE BRIDGES; PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCOUR; RISK; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; STREAMFLOW; CMIP5	The increasing intensity and frequency of extreme hydrological events poses a significant threat to the safety of transportation infrastructure across the globe. To reduce the failure risk associated with these structures, bridge assessment and management approaches should adapt to possible increases in future flood hazards. Fragility analysis can assist infrastructure managers in properly quantifying the reliability of bridges under different flood hazard intensity levels. However, conducting such analysis while accounting for various uncertainties associated with bridge capacity, deterioration, and future climate conditions can significantly increase the computational cost of bridge management procedures. To improve the computational efficiency of the fragility analysis while maintaining the desired accuracy, this paper integrates deep learning (DL) neural networks in a simulation-based probabilistic framework for establishing time-variant fragility surfaces of bridges under flood hazard. The proposed probabilistic framework considers the effects of climate change on flood occurrence and long-term scour hazard. Downscaled climate data, adopted from global climate models, are used to predict future precipitation and temperature profiles at a given location. Deep learning networks are employed with a twofold objective: (1) to predict future river streamflow at an investigated location necessary for assessing the scour conditions and flood hazard at the bridge, and (2) to simulate the structural behavior of a bridge foundation under sour conditions. The trained DL networks are integrated into a probabilistic simulation process to quantify failure probability and construct a bridge fragility surface under flood hazard. The proposed framework is illustrated on an existing bridge located in Oklahoma. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The single purpose adaptation approach often fails to address the multiple challenges arises from cascading effects of climate change at different scales and stages. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-dimensional flexible adaptation framework looking at the four dimensions of adaptation, structure, issue, time, and space (SITS). The SITS framework provides a comprehensive approach for cascading adaptation at trans-boundary river basin level and it could effectively enhance the adaptive capacity and transform livelihood outcome if properly implemented. Following the SITS framework, we examined four cascading adaptation pathways for: i) reducing disaster stressors on livelihoods, ii) enhancing access to crucial livelihood capitals, iii) improving equal rights to livelihood, and iv) strengthening synergies and exploiting complementarities at trans-boundary river basin level. The findings revealed that in the context of changing climate, it is necessary to employ different livelihood adaptation strategies and multiple responses simultaneously or sequentially to successfully adapt to the cascading effects of changing climate. The cascading adaptation may provide a sound basis on which to cope with the climate uncertainty through realistic scenarios of structure, issue, time and space. Its implementation, however, has several obstacles, for example, differences in national system, investment capacity, complexity of trans-boundary basin, remained particularly in trans-boundary river basin where managing transnational trade-offs and harness spatial synergies are critically important.

These hazards adversely affected specifically the livelihood of the farming community. This study tried to identify the factors affecting adaptation strategies of floods used by male and female household farmers in the Bait area of Punjab, Pakistan, by using primary data for empirical analysis. Focus group discussion, in-depth interviews and key information of respondents were used for the collection of primary data. Data comprised a total sample size of 293 respondents including 139 males and 154 females. Findings of the study indicated schooling years, training, age, agricultural labor, farming experience and access of agricultural land significantly affect adaptation strategies of farmers. In the empirical analysis, both regressions illustrated the goodness of fit of the model. Female model with values of higher adjusted R-2 exposed that factors integrated with the female model are more critical for flood adaptation strategies rather than the male model. Schooling years, access to agricultural land and agricultural labor were more significant factors in both groups according to estimates of regression. Agricultural land access and schooling years were highly significant factors for female as compared to male for adopting the adaptation strategies regarding floods. The government needs to form fair and equitable regulations specifically for female regarding schooling access, land ownership, land access, land use, promoting off-farm income opportunities, more remunerative adaptation strategies and less labor-intensive farming practices for these flood hazards areas for minimizing hazards losses and enhancing farming efficiency.

There are large uncertainties related to unknowns around the future and society's responses to these threats. Uncertainty' as other words with the prefix un' (unknown, untold, unrest) often has negative connotations. Yet, uncertainty is manifested in virtually everything we do. To many in science, uncertainty is akin to error that should be minimised, a lack of knowledge that needs to be rectified. We argue that uncertainty rather should be embraced as a starting point for discussing pathways to climate adaptation. Here we follow a definition of pathways to adaptation' as representing a set of proactive changes in the present that move people from a climatically unsafe place, to positions of safety (self-defined as representing freedom from harm or adverse effect). This article applies an inter-discursive analytical approach where (un)certainty and (un)safety are used to deepen the understanding around the positions of people in Senegal, and their livelihoods, with respect to climate hazards. We examine the discursive socio-cultural values active in the climate adaptive space. Our findings show that people's adaptive decisions often were not based on climate information, but on discursive values and emotions that guided them in the direction of responses that felt right. We conclude that acknowledging different understandings and perceptions of uncertainty, and the goal of achieving safety, allows issues of power to be discussed. We contend that this process helps illuminate how to navigate pathways of adaptation to the impacts of climate variability and change.

The built environment can mitigate the public health risk of overheating and recommendations for precautionary actions on homes have been published by government and industry. A key player in improving resilience is the householder, who can determine whether precautionary measures will be installed in their home. Previous research on flooding has applied Protection Motivation Theory to examine determinants of householder response to risk. However, flooding risks differ from those of overheating in several ways. The current study builds on this work to address the gap on understanding householder propensity to install precautionary measures against overheating. A large-scale survey (n = 1007) of householders was conducted in the south of England and regression analyses applied to the data. While threat appraisal (perception of threat risk and severity) had an influence on motivation to take action, coping appraisal (perception of ability to make changes, of the effectiveness of the changes and of convenience) was a stronger predictor, particularly for flat dwellers. Previous experience of overheating did not directly influence protection motivation. Age was negatively related to intentions to act but income was not a significant factor. Recommendations for policy and practice include focusing on enhancing coping appraisal, targeting older citizens, customising initiatives by type of property and occupancy, and framing mitigating actions in ways other than protection from overheating.

ANALYSIS OF DROUGHT-FLOOD ABRUPT ALTERNATION OF TOBACCO BASED ON PRECIPITATION AND SOIL PONDING IN SIUWEN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; drought-flood abrupt alternation disaster; continuous days without available precipitation; accumulative available precipitation during flood period; tobacco; Guiyang City	NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY	Drought-flood abrupt alternation disaster caused by climate change results in greater difficulty in disaster relief and more serious agricultural losses. In order to identify the characteristics of drought-flood abrupt alternation in the tobacco growth period and effectively prevent and reduce the drought-flood abrupt alternation disaster, the daily precipitation data in the tobacco growth period from 1951 to 2017 in Guiyang City are used and the data of soil moisture content in the Xiuwen country Irrigation Test Base of Guizhou Irrigation Test Center are adopted. By defining continuous days without available precipitation and the cumulative available precipitation during the flood period, the characteristics of drought-flood abrupt alternation in Guiyang are comprehensively analyzed. The results are as follows: (1) it can be verified by soil moisture content data that the law of drought-flood abrupt alternation in tobacco growth period can be accurately described based on continuous days without available precipitation and the cumulative available precipitation during the flood period. (2) In the tobacco growth period, there are two or more times of drought-flood abrupt alternation with low intensity. (3) In tobacco root extension period, there is no drought-flood abrupt alternation; during the flourishing growing period of tobacco, drought-flood abrupt alternation with low intensity prevails, and the intensity and frequency of drought-flood abrupt alternation increase; in tobacco mature period, the intensity of drought-flood abrupt alternation fluctuates greatly, and the intensity and frequency of drought-flood abrupt alternation increase. The research results can provide theoretical basis for the formulation of tobacco disaster prevention and mitigation countermeasures in Guiyang China.	[Zhang, Z. Z.; Yuan, Y.

Arthropods infected while blood-feeding on rodents can also transmit rodent-borne pathogens indirectly to humans and animals. Environmental events, such as wet winters, cooler summers, heavy rains, and flooding, have precipitated regional rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; these outbreaks are now increasing with climate change. The objectives of this review are to inform wilderness medicine providers about the environmental conditions that can precipitate rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; to describe the regional geographic distributions of rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America; and to recommend prophylactic treatments and effective prevention and control strategies for rodent-borne infectious diseases. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to identify scientific articles on outbreaks of the most common regional rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America. Wilderness medicine providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for regional rodent-borne diseases in patients who develop febrile illnesses after exposure to contaminated freshwater after heavy rains or floods and after swimming, rafting, or paddling in endemic areas. Public health education strategies should encourage limiting human contact with rodents; avoiding contact with or safely disposing of rodent excreta; avoiding contact with contaminated floodwaters, especially contact with open wounds; securely containing outdoor food stores; and modifying wilderness cabins and campsites to deter rodent colonization.

J	Crosweller, M; Tschakert, P				Crosweller, Mark; Tschakert, Petra			Disaster management and the need for a reinstated social contract of shared responsibility	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Leadership; Resilience; Climate change; Neoliberalism	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; RISK; NEOLIBERALISM; NATIONALISM; GOVERNMENT; LEADERSHIP; INQUIRIES; SECURITY; CRITIQUE	Extreme climate events and related disasters are increasing both in frequency and intensity. Resulting impacts materialize in the form of devastating bushfires, flooding, hurricanes, and cyclones and bring with them the tragic loss of life and substantial loss and damage to phenomena of value. Disaster management plays a central role in attempting to minimize and manage these impacts, and many government institutions posit that shared responsibility with citizens is the most effective approach to achieve this. However, some scholarship contends that shared approaches preference responsibility too far towards citizens and too far away from government institutions and are ineffective in lessening and managing such impacts. Here, we analyze governmental inquiries and actions undertaken regarding three past catastrophic disasters-2005 Hurricane Katrina (USA), the 2009 Victorian Bushfires (Australia), and the 2011 Queensland Floods (Australia). We assess, across these inquiries, 'what went wrong', 'what was working', and 'what needs fixing' with shared responsibility in disaster management. Our results indicate pervasive ineffectiveness in leadership, governance, trust, and resilience. We discuss how neoliberal influence contributes towards this ineffectiveness and suggest how this influence can be actively contested. We conclude by advocating for a reinstated social contract that inserts citizen rights and justice into disaster management policy making concomitant with the redistribution of public and third sector resources administered through inclusive governance frameworks. Such a social contract affords citizens greater opportunity to exercise agency whilst maximizing institutional support before, during, and after a disaster to provide greater protection and reduce harm.

The aim of this study is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities for the land-sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation.	[Schipper, Cor A.; Dekker, Gerben G.

This discussion was based on the Macromodel DNS (Discharge-Nutrient-Sea)/SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) results for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios and LU predictions. To track sediment yield responses on the sub-basin level the studied area was divided into 36 units. The response of individual sub-basins to climate scenarios created a mosaic of negative and positive sediment yield changes in comparison to the baseline scenario. Then, overlapped forest and agricultural areas change indicated those sub-basins where sediment yields could be balanced out or not. The model revealed that sediment yields could be altered even by 49% in the selected upper sub-basins during the spring-summer months, while for the lower sub-basins the predicted changes will be less effective (3% on average). Moreover, the winter period, which needs to be re-defined due to an exceptional occurrence of frost and snow cover protecting soils against erosion, will significantly alter the soil particle transfer among the seasons. Finally, it has been shown that modeling of sediment transport, based on averaged meteorological values and LU changes, can lead to significant errors.

Machine Learning to Evaluate Impacts of Flood Protection in Bangladesh, 1983-2014	WATER			English	Article						Bangladesh; climate resilience; flood protection; machine learning; socio-environmental impacts	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; MEGHNA	Impacts of climate change adaptation strategies need to be evaluated using principled methods spanning sectors and longer time frames. We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection. This has implications for Bangladesh's planning for future and more extreme climate futures, including the national Delta Plan, and global investments in climate resilient infrastructure to create positive social impacts.

The 2014 flood tragedy is recognized as the "Tsunami-like disaster" in the history of Malaysia. In that disaster, more than 404,000 victims were evacuated and at least 24 of them were reported deaths. In this work, the physicochemical alterations of the Pahang River, encompassing the solution pH, water temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonical-nitrogen (AN) and total suspended solids (TSS) were evaluated, after the largest flood tragedy. The significant relationship between the changing water quality parameters was assessed using the multivariate statistical analysis. Results revealed that the pollution loads showed a great amplification after the heavy flood event, with the mean values for BOD5, COD, DO, AN, solution pH, TSS, and overall water quality index of 17.28 mg/L, 64.5 mg/L, 3.97 mg/L, 1.52 mg/L, 5.23, 39.44 mg/L and 40.93, respectively, as compared with 4.65 mg/L, 15.3 mg/L, 6.62 mg/L, 0.26 mg/L, 7.22, 7.9 mg/L and 65.95, respectively before flooding. This complementary study highlights the pressing urgency to update the existing emergency water quality strategic plan, and establish better healthcare facilities for future emergency responses.

Under climate change, the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin has experienced evident increases in temperature and variability of precipitation. However, the study of the evolution characteristics of DFAA in the HuangHuai-Hai River Basin is limited and the risk of exposure to DFAA events under future climatic conditions should be comprehensively assessed. In this study, the DFAA events including drought to flood (DTF) and flood to drought (FTD) events in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), Huai River Basin (HuRB), and Hai River Basin (HaRB) are identified by the long-cycle drought-flood abrupt alternation index (LDFAI) and the temporal variation and spatial distribution of the number and intensity of DFAA events from 1961 to 2020 are examined. The 24 climate model simulations of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) are used to evaluate the variation of DFAA events based on the bias-corrected method. The results show that both DTF and FTD events occurred >10 times in most areas of the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin from 1961 to 2020, and severe DFAA events occurred more frequently in the HaRB. The occurrence of DTF events decreased and FTD events continuously increased in the YRB, while they showed opposite trends in the HuRB and HaRB. In the future, the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin is projected to experience more DTF events under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios, while more FTD events under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Most areas in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin are projected to be at medium or high risk of the frequency and intensity of DFAA events under different future scenarios, especially in the central part of the YRB. These findings can provide scientific reference to the formulation of management policies and mitigation strategies.

An increase in the air temperature has caused changes in the hydrologic cycle, which have been followed by several emergencies of natural extreme events around the world. Thailand is one of the countries that has incurred a huge loss in assets and lives from the extreme flood and drought events, especially in the northern part. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the hydrological regime in the Yom and Nan River basins, affected by climate change as well as the possibility of extreme floods and droughts. The hydrological processes of the study areas were generated via the physically-based hydrological model, namely the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The projected climate conditions were dependent on the outputs of the Global Climate Models (GCMs) as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 between 2021 and 2095. Results show that the average air temperature, annual rainfall, and annual runoff will be significantly increased in the intermediate future (2046-2070) onwards, especially under RCP 8.5. According to the Flow Duration Curve and return period of peak discharge, there are fluctuating trends in the occurrence of extreme floods and drought events under RCP 2.6 from the future (2021-2045) to the far future (2071-2095). However, under RCP 8.5, the extreme flood and drought events seem to be more severe. The probability of extreme flood remains constant from the reference period to the near future, then rises dramatically in the intermediate and the far future. The intensity of extreme droughts will be increased in the near future and decreased in the intermediate future due to high annual rainfall, then tending to have an upward trend in the far future.

However, until now the influence of drought on residents' health in the lower MDR, where river drought is highly sensitive to recently built hydropower plants, has not been examined. The objectives of this study are, for the first time, to detect the health impacts of river drought on residents and to evaluate the contribution of hydropower dams to the impacts of drought on health in the lower Mekong Delta Region (MDR). We applied the multi-step approaches of a Detection and Attribution study. First, we detected the effects of the river drought on the risk of hospitalization using a Multivariable Fractional Polynomials algorithm (MFP). Second, we linked the long-term changes of the river water level (RWL) to the operation of the first hydropower dam in the upper MDR using the interrupted time-series model (ITS). Finally, we quantified the hospitalizations and related economic loss attributed to the river drought. The results show that the percentage changes in risk of all-cause, respiratory, and renal hospitalizations attributed to the river drought were 2%, 2%, and 7%. There were significant reductions in average level and trend of the RWL during the post-1995 period, when the first hydropower dam began operation in the upper MDR, even though the cumulative rainfall in the MDR had not changed. The all-cause hospitalizations attributed to the river drought were 1134 cases during the period 1995-2014, which resulted in total additional cost at two provincial hospitals of US $360,385. This current study demonstrates the link between hydropower dams, river drought, and health impacts. As the MDR is highly vulnerable to climate change, these findings about the devastating impacts of hydropower dams and environmental change have important implications for the lives of downstream residents.

The study projects precipitation (P), air temperature (T), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and discharge (Q) in the entire catchment, as well as groundwater level (GWL) variation in the lowland part of the catchment, according to scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Projections of P and T are based on the results of a multimodel ensemble of seven regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX project. Runoff is simulated by a calibrated HBV-light model. The correlation between GWL and river discharge was modeled by soft computing techniques of artificial neural networks (ANN). The projections pertain to the period from 2021 to 2100. The Mann-Kendall trend test is used to check for a trend and its statistical significance, and the Mann-Whitney test to examine the statistical significance of a change in the mean ensemble median of time-series for the near future (2021-2050) and distant future (2071-2100), relative to the reference period (1971-2000). No notable changes are expected on an annual scale in the study area. However, the results show that the current non-uniformity of the monthly water distribution is growing. In the winter months at the end of the century, in RCP8.5, P and T are expected to increase, as is Q. Groundwater responds to increased river discharges by reduced depths to groundwater (increased GWL). A higher Q increases the flood risk in the winter months. In the warm season, RCP8.5 predicts a decrease in Q and increase in the depth to groundwater in the distant future. Reduced quantities of water in the warm period might have an adverse effect on drinking water supply, agriculture, hydropower, fisheries, ecology, and tourism in the study area.

In this regard, evaluating social vulnerability as a significant component of flood risk reduction is necessary. Indicators, in conjunction with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, have been recently employed to quantify social vulnerability. In the present study, an indicator-based approach was developed to assess social vulnerability to SLR and flooding in Bandar Abbas city coastal district, southern Iran. To build a social vulnerability index (SoVI) indicators were firstly categorized in, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity components. Indicators were then weighted using MCDM methods (i.e., analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy AHP models). Subsequently, an additive weighting model was employed to produce social vulnerability maps at the block level, and under different combined flooding scenarios in 2050 and 2100. Results showed that using the fuzzy AHP does not necessarily change the ranks of indicators and components compared to the AHP model. However, the spatial extents of social vulnerability were entirely different for both models due to differences in indicators weight. It confirms that using the AHP model as a simplified method can be acceptable when determining indicators and components weight is required. Although, in the case of identifying the detailed spatial extents of social vulnerability using the fuzzy AHP might be appropriate. For all scenarios, using the AHP and fuzzy AHP model, most districts were classified as medium and low vulnerable, respectively. Moreover, the impact of SLR resulting from climate change was significantly evident in the eastern and western parts, where more districts were recognized as highly and very highly vulnerable in the worst-case scenario (S4-2100). The results of this study provide valuable comparative information that can be employed by decision-makers in coastal planning and risk reduction at local scales.

The Three-North region (TNR) in China experiences diverse climate conditions, from arid to humid zones. In this region, substantial LCC has occurred over the past decades due to ecological restoration programs and urban expansion. At a regional scale, the hydrological effects of LCC have been demonstrated to be less observable than the effects of climate change, but it is unclear whether or not the effects of LCC may be intensified by future climate conditions. In this study, we employed remote sensing datasets and a macro-scale hydrological modeling to identify the dependence of the future hydrological regime of the TNR on past LCC. The hydrological effects over the period from 2020-2099 were evaluated based on a Representative Concentration Pathway climate scenario. The results indicated that the forest area increased in the northwest (11,691 km(2)) and the north (69 km(2)) of China but declined in the northeast (30,042 km(2)) over the past three decades. Moreover, the urban area has expanded by 1.3% in the TNR. Under the future climate condition, the hydrological regime will be influenced significantly by LCC. Those changes from 1986 to 2015 may alter the future hydrological cycle mainly by promoting runoff (3.24 mm/year) and decreasing evapotranspiration (3.23 mm/year) over the whole region. The spatial distribution of the effects may be extremely uneven: the effects in humid areas would be stronger than those in other areas. Besides, with rising temperatures and precipitation from 2020 to 2099, the LCC may heighten the risk of dryland expansion and flooding more than climate change alone. Despite uncertainties in the datasets and methods, the regional-scale hydrological model provides new insights into the extended impacts of ecological restoration and urbanization on the hydrological regime of the TNR.

Flood susceptibility-based building risk under climate change, Hyderabad, India	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							URBAN FLOOD	Urban floods have been highly prominent natural disasters occurring in catchments across the globe, causing financial loss and damage to buildings. This necessitates effective and sustainable mitigation mechanisms. In this context, flood susceptibility-based building risk (FSBR), a combined index for evaluating flood susceptibility and building risk simultaneously to understand the impact of the flood, is proposed by fusing XGBoost (facilitates flood susceptibility) and Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System 2D (enables building risk) in climate change situations. The methodology is applied to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, India. Six combinations of FSBR, namely, high building risk & high flood susceptibility (HH), high and medium (HM), medium and medium (MM), medium and high (MH), low and medium (LM), and low and high (LH) are employed to study the urban floods. The total affected areas for HH, HM, MH, MM, LH, and LM are 63.40 km(2) (52.627%), 28.92 km(2) (24%), 9.52 km(2) (7.9%), 4.81 km(2) (3.99%), 9.26 km(2) (7.686%), and 4.56 km(2) (3.79%) (totalling 120.47 km(2)). The number of corresponding buildings is 182,178, 84,136, 46,238, 22,691, 48,092, and 23,781. Waterproofing as a mitigation measure is considered. The total cost of waterproofing is Rs. 4,964.60 cr.

Nevertheless, current discourses and approaches to increase resilience tend to focus on broader socio-economic, physical and environmental systems. This reflects a failure by the academic and practitioner communities to consider the potential contribution of human interior dimensions in adaptation planning. Concomitantly, a growing body of knowledge highlights the need to bridge the gap between internal and external (systems) approaches for achieving sustainable transformations. Against this background, this article aims to increase knowledge on the operationalization of such more integrative approaches in marginal settings. Based on a case study of a flood adaptation project in Kibera, Kenya, we assess the need and potential ways to address interior dimensions in the context of project planning, design and implementation. We show how the integration of such dimensions occurs in existing adaptation projects and why this matters. On this basis, we provide methodological and operational recommendations regarding ways to support more integrative approaches that bridge subjective, intersubjective, objective and interobjective perspectives to support transformation.

The methodology adopted involves the development of hazard maps at territorial level, based on outputs from climate models, and the vulnerability assessment at building scale, underlying on physical and managerial criticalities of built heritage. Results are discussed for two pilot sites highly susceptible to flooding impacting large areas: Prague - Troja (CZ) and Krems - Stein (AT). Outcomes include climate projections of changes of the extreme precipitation index R5xday with spatial resolution of similar to 12 km for the near and far future (2021-2050; 2071-2100), under two different scenarios (stabilizing and pessimistic). A general increase of Rx5day in the investigated areas in the far future under the pessimistic scenario is foreseen, highlighting a high likelihood of flooding risk. Furthermore, it is determined that the buildings selected in the pilot areas present a high degree of vulnerability, mainly due to a lack of a maintenance plan and a significant susceptibility of the structures to water impact. Therefore preparedness turns out to be a crucial step in the management of the sites for enhancing their resilience to calamitous events.

These include particular civic discourses, perceptions of agency, and analytic deliberation, the latter integrating scientific information with local knowledge and social values. We describe three cases in eastern North Carolina, in the southeastern United States, with differing conceptions of economic development, environmental change, governance, property rights, and social collectivities. On the flat coastal plain and barrier islands, wetland conservation, soft engineering, and other coastal zone management options can protect shorelines from flooding and erosion, whereas hard engineered structures can cause long term problems. Fearing that scientific information would lower real estate values, a well-financed advocacy group averted public discussion of proactive policy by deploying discursive and legislative strategies to suppress scientific decision support. We find that a study site with high financial resources showed the most resistance to science-based adaptation in the public interest, whereas a study site with minimal financial resources was the most receptive. Ideology proves to be a significant consideration in the framing of information to advance coastal policy.

With climate projections showing increased risks of storms and extreme precipitation, the use of traditional measures alone is no longer an option. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) offer a suitable alternative to reduce the risk of flooding and provide multiple benefits. However, planning such interventions requires careful consideration of various factors and local contexts. The present paper provides contribution in this direction and it proposes a methodology for allocation of large-scale NBS using suitability mapping. The methodology was implemented within the toolboxes of ESRI ArcMap software in order to map suitability for four types of NBS interventions: floodplain restoration, detention basins, retention ponds, and river widening. The toolboxes developed were applied to the case study area in Serbia, i.e., the Tamnava River basin. Flood maps were used to determine the volume of floodwater that needs to be stored for reducing flood risk in the basin and subsequent downstream areas. The suitability maps produced indicate the potential of the new methodology and its application as a decision-support tool for selection and allocation of large-scale NBS.

Massive flooding, land erosion, over-exploitation of water, excessive fishing, habitat degradation and fragmentation, exploitation of flood plains, climate change impacts, absence of integrated basin wide management, and transboundary cooperation are major challenges for the present and future sustainability and development in the basin. Although hydrological connectivity is intact in most of the main course of the river, the infrastructure development plans may convert the Brahmaputra to a predominantly managed river system. In this regard, this paper examines the physiographic, ecological, hydrological, and socioeconomic status of the Brahmaputra river, its transnational basin in South Asia, and the basin population in the cross-cutting context to explore its sustainable management options. For a durable future of the river and its communities, an integrated management mechanism among the basin countries with the objective of equitable benefit sharing, disaster risk management, and resilience building is needed. The suggested strategies will help in maintaining the ecohydrological health and utilitarian services of the river for the socioeconomic development of millions of poor and marginalized people living in the basin.

Risk measures and the distribution of damage curves for 600 European coastal cities	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sea level rise; risk measures; costs; adaptation in cities; Europe	SEA-LEVEL PROJECTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; ECONOMICS; SCENARIOS; TIDE	A good understanding of climate change damages is vital to design effective adaptation policies and measures. Using a dataset of probabilistic sea-level rise and other of flood damages and protection cost curves for the 600 largest European coastal cities we generate stochastic damage curves and their distributions with and without adaptation. We apply the Generalized Extreme Value distribution to characterize the distributions and calculate two risk measures: the Value at Risk and the Expected Shortfall, which contribute to understanding the magnitude and probability of high-end sea-level rise represented by the upper tail of the distribution. This allows the costs of sea-level rise to be estimated (that is, in addition to other costs related to coastal extreme events) and supports decision-makers in integrating the high uncertainty related to future projections. This knowledge is necessary for an adequate risk management that does not underestimate risk. Furthermore, it allows city planners to tailor their risk tolerance. A great number of cities in Europe are currently undertaking adaptation plans or have already done so. Making these findings available should therefore be of great priority value to inform these processes.	[Abadie, L.

This study aims to explain the reasons for this difficulty through the case study of Guangzhou, a Chinese delta city that is highly vulnerable to coastal, fluvial and pluvial flooding, particularly in the context of a changing climate and rapid expansion of the urban fabric. It does so by investigating the recognition of flood risk in spatial planning and vice-versa, of spatial issues in the flood risk management field, using framing analysis. The paper reveals that the integration of flood risk concerns in spatial planning in Guangzhou remains an emerging process, gradually shifting from informal to formal activities grounded in legislation. This happens through percolation of framing discourse from the flood risk management policy to spatial planning, leading to changes in problem setting, action scripts and the prescribed governance arrangements in the planning discourse. The vagueness of governance arrangements, however, undermines the integration of flood risk management in spatial planning.

Despite their evident impacts, the risk associated with DFAA events has received limited attention. In this study, we present a comprehensive risk assessment model incorporating multifold natural and anthropogenic indicators to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of DFAA risk. Utilizing a DFAA index (DFAAI) based on river flow data from seven monitoring stations spanning 1999 to 2019, we investigate DFAA events in the Dianchi Basin, the largest lake in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, China. Our analysis reveals that 56% of total DFAA events occurred between June and August, with drought-to-flood (DTF) events accounting for 62.5% of DFAA occurrences in the Dianchi Basin. Notably, the intensity and frequency of DFAA events exhibit signiflcant spatial variations across the basin. The hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and disaster defense indices further exhibit substantial spatial discrepancies, with hazard indicators being the most influential, notably the DFAA rate accounting for 72.4% of the overall impact. Spatial correlations in DFAA risk among monitoring stations were found to be low, primarily influenced by variations in meteorological conditions, underlying surface characteristics, and human activities. The flndings of this study can offer valuable insights for effective water resource management in an ever-changing environment.

Study focus: The current research is designed to spatially identify different driving factors' contributions to natural runoff variation. The Water and Energy Transfer Process model was used to simulate the runoff of 2044 sub-basins. Based on this, trends of runoff variation were analyzed, and then, the mutation year of runoff variation in each sub-basin was detected. Moreover, the contribution rate of climatic variation and anthropogenic factors on runoff change in each subbasin was quantified. New hydrological insights for the region: The annual natural runoff in 90.66% of sub-basins and the flood-season (May to October) natural runoff in 45.99% of sub-basins showed declining trends. And the mutation year of runoff change mostly occurred in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The natural runoff change was primarily affected by climatic variation. The contribution rate of climate to the annual and flood-season natural runoff was 69.32% and 71.51%, respectively. While the contribution of man-made activities to the annual and the flood-season natural runoff was 30.68% and 28.49%, respectively, and the high-impact areas were largely distributed downstream. The research provides scientific support for developing and regulating water and land resources in the Yiluo River Basin.

The potential impact on the supply of crops such as rice is seen as a major food security issue that requires intervention on several fronts. The literature on rice production, climate variations and climate change show several studies outlining various impacts on rice supply as a result of variations in temperature and rainfall. This study intends to further explore the impacts on rice production caused by temperature changes and rainfall variation by analyzing and modelling the production of rice by the top rice-producing countries globally. A time series of the national rice production and yield along with national average annual temperature and rainfall were sourced for 15 major rice-producing countries. The trends of the time series were then compared between the rice productivity variables and temperature and rainfall. A panel regression model was also developed to further assess the relationship between rice production and temperature and rainfall. The time series showed that rice production and yield are increasing for the majority of the countries analyzed. The panel regression model however showed that continued increase in temperature can result in decreased production of rice and that rainfall volume directly impacts rice output and therefore shows rice production is highly susceptible to flooding and drought events caused by climate variabilities.

In this study, the hydrological model MESH (Modelisation Environmentale Com-munautaire -Surface and hydrology) was set up for the Groundhog River watershed situated in the Hudson Bay basin, to simulate the future evolution of streamflow and annual maximum streamflow. MESH was forced by meteorological data from ERA5 reanalyses in the historical period (1979-2018) and 12 models of the Coupled model intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) downscaled with the Canadian Regional Climate model version 5 (CRCM5) in historical (1979-2005) and scenario period (2006-2098). The projections consistently indicate an earlier spring flow and a reduction in the amount of annual maximum streamflow by the end of the 21st century. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the annual maximum streamflow occurring in the spring is expected to be advanced by 2 weeks and reduced on average from 852 m3/s (+/- 265) in the historical period (1979-2018) to 717m3/s (+/- 250) by the end of the 21st century (2059-2098). Because the seasonal projection of streamflow was not investigated in previous studies, this work is an important first step to assess the seasonal change of streamflow in the Hudson Bay region under climate change.

Co-Creating Climate Adaptation Pathways in Coastal Cities: A Practical Guide for Engaged Scholars and Urban Designers	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						participatory engagement; community-based research; flood hazards; sustainable city; resilient waterfront; interdisciplinary studies; urban design	DEEP UNCERTAINTY; COMMUNITY; CAPACITY	As the repercussions of climate change materialize, coastal cities are often at the forefront of experiencing environmental impacts like flooding and storm events. In addition, anthropogenic vulnerability drivers, like industrial activity in the near-shore environment, may accelerate shoreline erosion or nuisance flooding through the loss of natural shoreline buffers and increased ship traffic. This interdisciplinary study applied a participatory mixed-methods approach, co-creating climate change adaptation pathways with community and stakeholder input as a bottom-up task. The aims were to engage in a community dialogue (1) identifying assets and challenges within the natural and built environment based on community input, (2) utilizing a participatory mixed-methods approach to model and quantify selected hazards, and (3) transforming them into adaptation pathways visualized in a comprehensive master plan. The small-town of Ingleside on the Bay, Texas, served as a case study for this project, highlighting how sea-level rise and industrial activity challenge the community, its natural and cultural environment, and the infrastructure within. The outcomes identify anthropogenic vulnerability drivers and propose a concrete list of seven adaptation pathways based on community input. This study helps engaged scholars and decision-makers to activate community members and their knowledge as an integral component of their work, from identifying a problem to developing tangible solutions.

Flood resilience, the key to improving the ability of cities to cope with flood disasters, is highly related to flood vulnerability. Currently, most studies tend to assess flood resilience from economic, social and environmental dimensions, without quantitatively analyzing the feedback relationships between various elements of resilience. Some studies involving resilience models fail to completely reflect various time periods of resilience. Aim of this research is to develop a quantitative model from perspective of the correlation of vulnerability and resilience to achieve quantitative assessment of urban flood resilience. Firstly, multi-dimensional relationships between flood vulnerability and resilience was analyzed, and conceptual model was developed using an improved entity relationship diagram (E-R diagram), furtherly establishing a quantitative model of urban flood resilience that considers recovery capacity in post-disaster. Secondly, quantitative assessment of urban flood resilience of 16 districts in Beijing was implemented through the quantitative model and integrated weight method based on indicator system. The following results are obtained: the influence of different factors on flood resilience, the characteristics of elements of resilience and the characteristics of pre-disaster, mid-disaster and postdisaster reflected by them, as well as spatial variation in flood resilience. In addition, recovery capability plays an important role in flood resilience.

Here, slackwater paleoflood sediments of the Nalinggele River, the largest river in the Qaidam Basin, were studied with optically stimulated luminescence dating and grain size analysis to reconstruct flood events, mechanisms and their climatic implications. Seven slackwater deposit layers which show a weak hydrodynamic sedimentary environment, were dated to three main flood stages at ca. 3.6-3.4 ka, 2.2 ka and 1.0 ka. These stages correspond to similar millennial-scale flood activities in the basin bordering Kunlun Mountains, millennial-scale humid intervals in the eastern Qaidam Basin, glacial melting events on the Tibetan Plateau, and as well warm intervals between cold ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic, which may triggered by and the intensified solar activities. These flood stages were attributed to increased precipitation from the enhanced Asian Summer Monsoon and increased glacial meltwater delivery during the late Holocene. The findings suggest that a climate on the northeastern Tibtean Plateau that was fluctuant and with humid periods during the late Holocene, and not undergoing a constant drying trend as previously understood.

This paper investigates rural households' vulnerability to floods in the seven agricultural-based regions of Pol-e Dokhtar, south of Lorestan Province, Iran. The primary data for the vulnerability indicators were collected from 322 households. Three main components of vulnerability, including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, were measured using the obtained data. The weighting of indicators was done by the MSF method and using MATLAB software. The results showed that the social and economic characteristics of households affect their vulnerability to floods. The Jayder, Mamolan, and Afrineh regions, which were more exposed to floods, had less capacity for adaptation. The results showed that the most vulnerable communities could be described by characteristics such as low levels of agricultural insurance, limited access to credit, low levels of income diversification, high levels of unemployment, low levels of social capital, higher dependency ratios, and poor infrastructure. This research showed that diversified livelihoods have a significant effect on reducing farmers' sensitivity to floods. The study proposes policy implications to increase resilience and reduce farmers' vulnerability to floods. The government and other development partners should prioritize the most vulnerable areas by improving their access to finance and providing the technical assistance required for increasing their coping capacity.

As such, there is burgeoning attention in research and policy surrounding relocation that is managed and supported through external sources. Yet there exists limited research into the ways Indigenous communities are autonomously retreating from emerging coastal hazard risk, despite long histories of mobility and inherent adaptive capacities. We contribute to this gap through qualitative data derived from two low-lying coastal iTaukei (Indigenous Fijian) communities that are exposed to coastal erosion, storm surges, and flooding events, alongside other socioeconomic pressures. We explore the approach of "generational retreat" which is emerging as a long-term relocation strategy employed by village residents. Generational retreat is a form of mobility whereby households, namely, younger generations, incrementally retreat in response to existing, emerging, and anticipated coastal changes while maintaining connections to place and village life. We show how communities are drawing on local processes and resources to direct autonomous adaptation pathways which are suited to local sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental contexts. We further explore opportunities for governments and external actors in supporting these locally conceived and driven forms of retreat as an adaptive and sustainable response to coastal change.

Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones.

This study used the Guttman's scale approach to assess household water insecurity in the CMR. Factor and cluster analyses were then applied to confirm the results and identify issues that shaped household water insecurity in four urbanisation levels in the CMR, namely urban, urban/peri-urban transition (UPT), peri-urban, and rural. Data were obtained through surveys of 225 farm households and 205 non-farm households using face-to-face interviews. The study shows spatial variations of water insecurity concerning urbanisation and farm and non-farm households. The study indicates that dominant factors shaping household water insecurity in the CMR are (i) unacceptable levels in water risks and (ii) inadequate water sources and services to satisfy the population's needs in relation to health, livelihood, ecosystems, and production. Flooding in the region significantly affects water insecurity of UPT farm and non-farm households, while droughts affect rural farm and non-farm households. The methodology used in this study provides an analytical framework to better understand socio-ecohydrological issues underpinning farm and non-farm household water insecurity and for developing an evidence-based water security policy in a rapidly urbanising region.

This study focuses on the Port-Bouet Bay, located in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. A coastal flood model based on the enhanced bathtub model was used to map the present and future flood extent and assess exposure to quantify the likely affected populations, buildings, and land uses for different scenarios. The model incorporated a digital elevation model, surface roughness, flood water source, and the once a century extreme sea-level scenarios. Validation was conducted against GPS coordinates of recently flooded zones. The analysis revealed that, under current conditions, around 21.58 hectares are vulnerable to flooding, and approximately 2465 people and 544 buildings are exposed to flooding today. Based on future projections, the extent of flooding is anticipated to increase by different ranges depending on the time period and the climate change conditions. By the end of the century, the increase in flooding extent could reach a percentage of 27%, 37%, and 90% under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The impacts would consequently be worsened with greater number of people and assets exposed to future coastal flood hazard. The land use analysis showed that informal settlements are the occupation most exposed, followed by residential settlements, commercial and industrial land, in that order. The spatial disaggregation of this exposure across neighborhoods indicates that Sogefiha is the most exposed, followed by Petit-Bassam and Vridi. However, a substantial increase in coastal flooding in Vridi by 2100 under the SSP5-8.5 scenario could lead to significant exposure level change for this scenario. This information is critical for evaluating and managing present and future coastal flood risks in the Port-Bouet Bay area and for informing decision-making processes.

Investigating dam-induced flow regime alterations is essential for understanding potential adverse downstream effects and facilitating dialogue around coordinated water use in transboundary basins, such as the Lancang River Basin (LRB). This study explored the value of combining several types of satellite Earth observation (EO) datasets that monitor different water balance components to constrain the parameter space of lumped conceptual hydrological models. Thus, we aimed to reconstruct the natural flow regimes upstream and downstream of the cascade reservoirs. Specifically, reservoir water storage changes were first estimated using satellite imagery and altimetry datasets. Then, storage changes were combined with hydrological model simulations of reservoir inflow to estimate the regulated flow regime downstream. Our results showed that integrated hydrological modeling combined with EO datasets exhibited better overall performance. Continuous warming and drying of the LRB resulted in a decrease in discharge of approximately 47 %. By comparing the simulated natural and regulated flow regimes, we revealed the pivotal role of the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs in regulating natural flows. The wet season shortens (approximately 45 days), the flood peak flattens, and the low flow in the dry season has primarily increases. The two reservoirs attenuated 50 % of the flood peaks in the wet seasons and mitigated droughts by releasing up to 100 % of the natural flows in the dry seasons at the China-Laos border. Overall, these results enhance the understanding of upper reservoir operation, and the approaches can be applied to studies of dammed basins under climate change scenarios when knowledge of the upstream area is limited.

Farming community livelihood particularly inhabited in flood-prone area has become more vulnerable due to these consecutive riverbank erosion and disasters. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change on livelihood vulnerability in riverbank erosion Bait community flood-prone area of Punjab, Pakistan. Livelihood vulnerability index approach is comprised of LVI-IPCC with major and subpotential components which were applied for empirical estimation of 240 Bait area respondents of the study area. Livelihood vulnerability index estimated value 0.47 indicated lower socioeconomic conditions caused widen gap among community networking in the study area. Climate vulnerability index estimated value -0.0176 illustrated as study district is higher vulnerable due to calculated values of sensitivity 0.44, exposure 0.50 while with lower adaptive capacity 0.46. Inhabited population in the study area is mostly vulnerable of climate change due to high value of ecological degradation 0.49 in outward appearance of deforestation and riverbank erosion. Bait communities of flood-prone area have limited and traditional adaptive capacities owing to future disasters, inadequate awareness, low level of education and higher poverty as such scenario exposes not capable of adapting environmental changes. These significant estimates of the study are earth-shattering to policy makers to scrutinize the root grounds of livelihood vulnerability and develop the agricultural adaptation for flood-prone rural population. In local scenario there is need to application of such feasible measures as enhancing off-farm income sources, construction of concrete banks and water reservoirs on rivers, developing overhead infrastructure and provision of awareness and training to upcoming hazards.

Given the anticipated increase in compound flood hazards in river deltas in a warming climate, climate-informed regional to local extreme water levels (EWLs) is thus critical for decision-makers to evaluate flood hazards and take adaptation measures. We develop a simple yet computationally efficient stress test framework, which combines historical and projected climatological information and a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model, to assess future compound coastal-fluvial flood hazards in river deltas. Our framework is applied in the world's largest single urban area, China's Pearl River Delta (PRD), which is also characterized by densely crossed river network. We find that extreme sea level is the dominant driver causing the compound coastal-fluvial flood in the PRD over the past 60 years. Meanwhile, there is large spatial heterogeneity of the individual and compound effects of the typhoon intensity, local sea-level rise, and riverine inflow on coastal-fluvial floods. In a plausible disruptive scenario (e.g., a 0.50 m sea-level rise combined with a 9% increase in typhoon intensity in a 2 degrees C warming), the EWL will increase by 0.76 m on average. An additional 1.54 and 0.56 m increase in EWL will occur in the river network and near the river mouth, respectively, if coastal floods coincide with the upstream mean annual flood. Findings from our modeling framework provide important insights to guide adaptation planning in river deltas to withstand future compound floods under climate change.

A calibrated and validated SWAT rainfall-runoff model was used to generate flood hydrographs for the period 1969-2050 using historical rainfall data and projected rainfall based on the CORDEX-Africa regional climate model. Results showed that climate change has a greater impact on change in peak flows than land-cover change when the two are treated separately in theory. It was observed that, in the past, the probability of occurrence of urban flooding in the study area was likely to be increased up to 1.5-fold by climate change relative to land-cover change. In the future, this figure is estimated to decrease to 1.1-fold. The coupled effects of climate and land-cover changes cause a much bigger impact on change in peak flows than any separate scenario; this scenario represents the actual scenario on the ground. From the combined effects of climate and land-cover changes, the magnitudes of mean peak flows were determined to increase between 34.4 and 58.6% in the future relative to the past. However, the change in peak flows from combined effects of climate and land-cover changes will decrease by 36.3% in the future relative to the past; owing to the lesser variations in climate and land-cover changes in the future compared with those of the past.

Santhosh			Climate change impact and vulnerability assessment of Mumbai city, India	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Climate change; Mumbai; Sea-level rise; Erosion; Remote sensing	OCEAN; COAST; RISK; URBANIZATION; CITIES	Climate change (CC) is one of the most challenging problems of today which need to be understood. CC impact studies at the urban centres are the need of the hour. Mumbai is one of the most vulnerable port cities in the world and one of the most densely populated cities in the world. The city is vulnerable to CC-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm surge, flooding, and coastal erosion. In this study, it is tried to do the spatial integration of vulnerability from these hazards to portray the overall CC-induced impacts in Mumbai city. This study portraits the overall vulnerability of the Mumbai megacity, considering SLR, long-term coastal erosion, and flooding. This integrated vulnerability assessment reveals that 123.35 km(2) (24%) of the Mumbai regions is demarcated as composite vulnerable regions. They are mostly around the coastal tracts. Within the vulnerable regions, inland flood-affected areas from the past floods area are 37.13 km(2), which is around 30% of the demarcated most vulnerable regions. Remaining vulnerable areas are falling in built up, barren, forest, vegetation, and mangrove regions. The most worrying impact would be in the 44 km(2) of the built-up areas, which is around 35% of the vulnerable regions. It pulls the city to one of the most vulnerable cities of the world due to the exposure of the higher population. Rest of all the classes can cope up as they are naturally covered, not covered, and the human population is not residing over those regions currently. Since the city is expanding rapidly, other LULC classes apart from built-up land have to be converted based on the need. Available barren land can be kept for rehabilitation in the future. This study provides vital information about the CC-induced vulnerability of Mumbai city.	[Murali, R. Mani; Riyas, M. J.; Reshma, K. N.; Kumar, S.

This paper proposes to analyze the worldwide scientific production on social vulnerability of coastal populations through six bibliometric indicators: typology, historical evolution, geographic distribution, main sources, relevant authors and publications and recurring keywords. The research theme was chosen given the continuous increase of studies related to climatic changes and their consequences to populations in coastal zones. In total, 191 indexed documents covering the period from 1991 to 2019 were selected from the Scopus database, after the examination of more than 900 entries, and analyzed through VOSViewer software and the Bibliometrix R package. The results obtained confirmed the exponential growth of scientific production on this subject. Most frequently impacts considered were coastal flooding and erosion triggered by extreme events and the majority of studies have been presented as academic articles published in scientific journals. Moreover, most documents identified were site-specific, based on secondary data and associated with authors from the USA and the UK, with an emerging production related to authors from developing economies in recent years. Among the 658 authors found, only nine have published three or more articles on the theme, with citations highly concentrated in only four publications. The analysis also revealed the evolution of preferred keywords over time and the lack of consensus in the use of terminology. Studies about coastal social vulnerability were initially mostly focused on the evaluation of risks and exposure to hazards, evolving over time such that the focus shifted to adaptation measures seeking to minimize impacts from climate change to coastal zones.

Precipitation and temperature projections supplied by climate models do not usually fit exactly the statistical properties of the observed time series in the control period. Bias correction methods are used to reduce such errors. This paper seeks to find the most adequate bias correction techniques for temperature and precipitation projections that minimizes the errors between observations and climate model simulations in the control period. Errors in flood quantiles are considered to identify the best bias correction techniques, as flood quantiles are used for hydraulic infrastructure design and safety assessment. In addition, this study aims to understand how the expected changes in precipitation extremes and temperature will affect the catchment response in flood events in the future. Hydrological modelling is required to characterize rainfall-runoff processes adequately in a changing climate, in order to estimate flood changes expected in the future. Four catchments located in the central-western part of Spain have been selected as case studies. The HBV hydrological model has been calibrated in the four catchments by using the observed precipitation, temperature and streamflow data available on a daily scale. Rainfall has been identified as the most significant input to the model, in terms of its influence on flood response. The quantile mapping polynomial correction has been found to be the best bias correction method for precipitation. A general reduction in flood quantiles is expected in the future, smoothing the increases identified in precipitation quantiles by the reduction of soil moisture content in catchments, due to the expected increase in temperature and decrease in mean annual precipitations.

Ecology of scree skinks (<i>Oligosoma waimatense</i>) in O Tu Wharekai Wetland, mid-Canterbury high country, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; flooding; Oligosoma; predation; skink; Southern Alps	REPTILIA SCINCIDAE; GENUS OLIGOSOMA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIZARD; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION; SURVIVAL	Many of New Zealand's 104 lizard taxa are restricted to the country's main islands where they are vulnerable to a range of threats. Information on population trends and basic ecological data are lacking for most species, hampering conservation efforts. We monitored a population of scree skinks (Oligosoma waimatense; conservation status: Nationally Vulnerable) in an alluvial stream bed in O Tu Wharekai Wetland in the midCanterbury high country over 10 years (2008-2018) to understand aspects of the population's ecology, and to clarify potential threats and options for management. Although there was no linear trend in scree skink capture numbers over this time, an 84% decline was observed following severe and unseasonal flooding in May 2009. Capture numbers recovered over c. 8.5 years in the absence of any species management. Skinks ranged in size from 60-114 mm (snout-to-vent length). Home range size estimates varied from 39.5 to 950 m(2) (100% Minimum Convex Polygons) and their mean size was smaller than those reported for closely-related species. Photo-identification was not sufficiently accurate for long-term individual identification. Threats at our study site include severe flooding, predation by pest mammals, weed encroachment and human interference. Climate change is likely to increase future flood risk to this population and to other threatened species inhabiting the upland reaches of Southern Alps rivers. We recommend: (1) continued monitoring at our study site to assess long-term trends in a flood-prone population of scree skinks; (2) monitoring of four additional populations in scree habitat for 10 years to determine threats and management needs; (3) a survey of Black Jacks Island in Lake Benmore to determine whether the species (last seen there in the 1980s) is still present; and (4) the immediate removal of wilding conifers and other exotic trees from affected sites.

This article presents a systemic approach to assess the present ecological status of a tropical floodplain wetland concerning the fisheries and associated ecosystem services. The analysis of historic climatic data indicated significant change (increasing average annual air temperature, R-2 = 0.098; decreasing total annual rainfall, R-2 = 0.042). In addition, a significant reduction in the wetland area was also observed. Altogether, 45 fish species were reported in the studied wetland, of which 2 are listed as endangered and 7 are near threatened. The present study demonstrated the variation of the important fisheries-related environment and nutrient parameters of the wetland through the geographic information system (GIS)-based spatial distribution map for the reader's digest. It has been found that the provisioning ecosystem services are higher in number (n=9) followed by supporting (n=6), regulating (n=4), and cultural (n=2) ecosystem services. Finally, we have discussed some important case-specific sustainable climate-smart adaptation and mitigation approaches to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of fishers.

In this article, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate runoff and nitrogen loading in the middle reaches of the Fenhe River. The model was calibrated by the SWAT calibration and uncertainty procedure (SWATCUP) to achieve the accuracy of simulating runoff and nitrogen loadings. Furthermore, 20 climate change scenarios and 7 extreme land use change scenarios were set up and run on the calibrated model. The results showed that runoff and nitrogen loading decreased when temperature increased and increased with increasing precipitation. Runoff was more sensitive to changes in precipitation (+/- 10%) than temperature (+/- 2 degrees C), while nitrogen loading showed the opposite pattern. When the two climatic factors changed in the same direction, the combined effect was larger than either factor alone, whereas the change in the opposite direction produced a weaker effect. The changes produced by different extreme land use scenarios on runoff and nitrogen loading were significantly different and were more obvious during the flood season than in the non-flood season. The results of this study provide a useful guide for water resource managers.

Drivers, dynamics and impacts of changing Arctic coasts	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review							BEAUFORT SEA COAST; GROUND-ICE; NORTH SLOPE; LAPTEV SEA; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; PERMAFROST BLUFFS; RIVER DISCHARGE; YUKON-TERRITORY; HERSCHEL ISLAND; ORGANIC-CARBON	Arctic coasts are increasingly affected by erosion and flooding, owing to decreasing sea ice, thawing permafrost and rising sea levels. This Review examines the changes in Arctic coastal morphodynamics and discusses the broader impacts on Arctic systems. Arctic coasts are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and the loss of permafrost, sea ice and glaciers. Assessing the influence of anthropogenic warming on Arctic coastal dynamics, however, is challenged by the limited availability of observational, oceanographic and environmental data. Yet, with the majority of permafrost coasts being erosive, coupled with projected intensification of erosion and flooding, understanding these changes is critical. In this Review, we describe the morphological diversity of Arctic coasts, discuss important drivers of coastal change, explain the specific sensitivity of Arctic coasts to climate change and provide an overview of pan-Arctic shoreline change and its multifaceted impacts. Arctic coastal changes impact the human environment by threatening coastal settlements, infrastructure, cultural sites and archaeological remains. Changing sediment fluxes also impact the natural environment through carbon, nutrient and pollutant release on a magnitude that remains difficult to predict. Increasing transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration efforts will build the foundation for identifying sustainable solutions and adaptation strategies to reduce future risks for those living on, working at and visiting the rapidly changing Arctic coast.

The Impacts of Extreme Weather Events on Inflation and the Implications for Monetary Policy in Africa	PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Extreme weather events; floods; droughts; headline inflation; food inflation; Africa	NATURAL DISASTERS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INCLUSIVE EDUCATION; INEQUALITY; DETERMINANTS; TEMPERATURE	Economic debates around mitigating climate change and weather-related events have long centred on fiscal policy tools than those of monetary policy. However, recent discussions point out that monetary policy formulation could also be affected and hence the need to deploy monetary policy tools as well. Our article seeks to investigate the impacts of climate change, particularly extreme weather events, on headline inflation and food price inflation and their apparent implications for monetary policy in Africa over the period 1990-2017. Using a two-step dynamic system Generalized Method of Moments estimation strategy with robust standard errors, we find that weather-related events may need to be large and consequential to cause a significant price hike in Africa. We also find the incidence of droughts and floods to have a bearing on food price inflation. Furthermore, our empirical evidence using mediation analysis, reveals agricultural production to be the critical mechanism whereby extreme weather events affect headline inflation. As central banks are charged with the mandate of ensuring a stable monetary environment, we suggest that monetary policy authorities consider the short and long run impacts of supply shocks caused by extreme weather events on general price levels in their policy formulation.

Sea-level-rise-induced flooding drives arsenic release from coastal sediments	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Climate change; Sea-level rise; Flooding; Arsenic release; Water pollution	TERM RESUSPENSION EVENTS; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; NUTRIENT RELEASE; METALS; REMOBILIZATION; DIAGENESIS; SPECIATION; OXIDATION; EXCHANGE; SOILS	Sea-level rise (SLR) has a vital influence on coastal hydrogeological systems, biogeochemical processes, and the fate of coastal contaminants. However, the effects of SLR-induced perturbations on the mobilization of coastal pollutants are not fully understood. In this study, the impact of SLR-induced flooding on the concentration and speciation of arsenic and selected hazardous chemicals is investigated using exceedingly contaminated sediments (5-6% As) collected from an urban coastal site in Wilmington, DE, USA. The release of contaminants from sediments was monitored before, during, and after flooding with different intensities (bottom shear stresses) through laboratory-based erosion chamber experiments. Significantly increased release of As (up to 150%) and NO3 (up to 50%) from sediments at shear stress levels typically measured in estuaries were found. The release of toxic chemicals from contaminated coastal sediments is thus not restricted to extreme flooding events but can occur throughout the year. The results also suggest that the dissolved concentrations of pollutants continue to be considerably high even after the flooding. SLR-induced flooding can hence increase the release of contaminants not only during erosion events but over longer timescales. The release mechanism proposed here contributes to improving the risk assessment of coastal water pollution as climate change and SLR continue to occur.

This storm illustrates how a single major event can have long-lasting effects on climate risk management. To discern this effect, we conduct two studies analyzing the emergence and evolution of concerns related to marine submersion in French national and regional newspapers prior to and after the storm (2005-2018). In Study 1, we examine trends in issue coverage and how "marine submersion" was appropriated by French media discourse over the selected period, identifying and segmenting specific topical sequences. In Study 2, a computer-assisted content analysis of 260 articles highlights a dichotomy of themes before and after Storm Xynthia. Articles published prior to Xynthia (2005-2009) warned of marine submersion among the expected impacts of climate change. Those published just after Xynthia (2010-2013) present highly structured and technical descriptions of national risk management policies. In recent years (2014-2018), articles focus on local stakeholders' challenge to national risk management policies, described as too far removed from local dynamics. Our studies reveal the emergence and amplification, via public debate in French newspaper media, of "marine submersion" as a hazard, and the objectification of the risk through Storm Xynthia.

Yet, the literature on urban floods suggests limited estimates of "perceived vulnerability", the latter increasingly gaining acceptance in climate change and disaster knowledge communities. Subsequently in this article, the effects of socio-demographic characteristics of households in underestimating their perceived vulnerability to flooding in Ghana is analysed, for informed flood disaster risk reduction. The findings show female headed households and those with college education as relatively more likely to underestimate their vulnerability to floods, compared to male headed households and those with no education, respectively. The age of male household heads determined their underestimation of floods yet the relatiowas non-linear. Additionally, the perceived vulnerability of a household to floods and ability to estimate its status depends on the sex of household head, to potentially influence decision-making and choice of adaptation. In conclusion, differences in the effects of households' background characteristics on perceived vulnerability and capacity to estimate the outcome suggest context specific measures or social interventions in addressing attitudes towards floods disaster risk, and subsequently in formulating disaster risk reduction strategies and policy interventions.

Cities can benefit from preventing these effects through adaptation measures. However, before any action can be taken in improving these urban climate conditions, an awareness of the problems is needed. Numerous studies show that there is awareness of urban climate extremes as a problem, yet that knowledge lacks amongst different actors in society, and may further differ between countries. Therefore, we conducted an international study on the awareness levels regarding urban climate phenomena and the sense of urgency to act within four groups: citizens, local politicians, urban planners and designers, and urban climate experts. Semi-structured interviews with experts in ten countries worldwide were conducted. Results indicate that the urgency to adapt to climate change was acknowledged rather equally for the four groups of actors. In contrast, awareness of urban climate phenomena (urban heat islands and urban wind patterns) amongst citizens and politicians is rather low in most countries. Amongst urban planners and designers and the urban climate experts we observed a generally high awareness regarding urban climate phenomena. Raising awareness requires tailor-made strategies for specific needs of the different actor groups.

However, the detailed links between continental weathering and climate change over shorter timescales, and their potential impact on sediment records deposited in the ocean, remain poorly understood. Here, we present clay mineralogy and strontium-neodymium isotopic data for marine sediment records from the Northern Indian Ocean, with the aim of investigating the weathering response of large Himalayan river basins to orbital and millennial climate forcing. We show that past glaciated episodes of the late Quaternary corresponded to periods of increased physical erosion, associated with the preferential export of illite and chlorite assemblages from the Himalayan highlands having relatively radiogenic Sr isotopic signatures. In contrast, the warm periods of enhanced monsoon rainfall coincided with the transport of intensively weathered smectite-dominated soils derived from the floodplains, characterized by lower(87)Sr/Sr-86 signatures. This finding suggests that the short-term climatic variability over late Quaternary timescales was accompanied by concomitant changes between high mountain- versus floodplain-dominated weathering regimes, with possible impact on the nature of weathered rocks and, as a consequence, on the carbon cycle.

Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city.

J	Benetó, P; Khodayar, S				Beneto, Pau; Khodayar, Samira			On the need for improved knowledge on the regional-to-local precipitation variability in eastern Spain under climate change	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Review						Precipitation trends; Climate change; Atmospheric processes; Eastern Spain	MEDITERRANEAN HEAVY-PRECIPITATION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SEASONAL PRECIPITATION; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CONCENTRATION INDEX; IBERIAN PENINSULA; FLASH-FLOOD; SEA-STATE; RAINFALL; TRENDS	The Western Mediterranean is a climate change hotspot subject to generalized drying together with an increased torrentiality in precipitation with future scenarios pointing toward an extremization of these conditions. Projections indicate a further enhancement of differences between dry summers and wet autumns that already characterize this region. However, relevant uncertainties and discrepancies among projections exist including contrasting results complicating planification for future adaptation to climate change impacts in the Western Mediterranean. Both, the water supply for ecosystems and communities as well as the safety and well-being of the inhabitants are in danger. Detailed knowledge of the regional-to-local precipitation variability and evolution in the present climate together with an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which is the objective of this investigation, will provide a better comprehension of projected future trends in the region. In this context, the present study provides a comprehensive evaluation of precipitation spatiotemporal characteristics and trends for the period 1951-2020 employing novel high-resolution gridded observations (SPAIN02) with a focus in eastern Spain, Hydrographic Confederations of Ebro (EBRO), Jucar-Segura (CHJS) and the Mediterranean Basins of Andalusia (CMA) that conform it from north to south. Particular attention is on the analysis of the Jucar-Segura (CHJS) basin. Results indicate a marked precipitation seasonality along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, with localized areas showing increasing trends, and a substantial drying during summer in the last seven decades reinforcing the already remarkable interseasonal variability characterizing the region. In contrast, moderate-to-heavy precipitation events have intensified in the last three decades for all seasons over central regions. Non-significant seasonal trends are identified for the winter, spring and autumn for the period under study, however, substantial intraseasonal variability dominates precipitation changes in these periods, particularly a significant mean precipitation decrease is observed in March and June. Interestingly, in the last two decades, summer precipitation presents a non-significant negative trend, with some areas over central regions showing an increase in precipitation contrasting with the general mean decrease observed during the period 1951-2020. The detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms responsible for interseasonal and intraseasonal precipitation variations in the period 2000-2020 indicates that a frequency increase and intensification of orographically induced summer storms drive the observed summer precipitation increase in the JucarSegura basin. While the main changes during winter, spring, and autumn are principally linked to an intensification of precipitation events as a consequence of changes in moisture advection from the Mediterranean. Ongoing variability in this region can represent a mirror of the changes to come over similar areas around the world as a consequence of global warming.

Based on data obtained from Toudaoguai Hydrological Station from 1959 to 2021, this study examines the characteristics of the ice regime during cold and warm winters and the water and sediment transport processes along the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia in the context of climate change. The Mann-Kendall test and trend analysis were applied to define the years of temperature mutations and their trends, and the temperature mutation point was determined to be the 1987/1988 season. The study considers the effect of climate change on the combination of hydrological and hydraulic conditions. Therefore, trends in suspended sediment transport, ice type formation, water discharge, and storage in different ice flood seasons (November 1 to March 31, from 1998 to 2021) were attained. Based on the cumulative negative air temperature, winters were categorized into three types, warm, normal, and cold (52.2%, 17.4%, and 30.4%, respectively). Strong and weak grades further divide cold and warm winters, and statistical analyses were used to examine the characteristics of ice, water discharge, channel storage, and sediment transport. The duration of open water, freeze-up, ice cover, and breakup periods were calculated, and the relationship between the suspended sediment transport rate and discharge rate in these various ice periods was defined. The obtained relations show that the suspended sediment rate during the ice cover and first drift was smaller than that during the open water and post-breakup conditions. For the ice cover period, the sediment transport rate was on average approximately four times smaller than the freeze-up condition and six times smaller than the open water condition. The reduced sediment transport rate in the freeze-up period can be attributed to the weakened vertical turbulent mixing and increased flow resistance.

Flood regime alters the abiotic correlates of riparian vegetation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; climate variability; cottonwood; flood; groundwater; New Mexico; plant diversity; plant invasion; Rio Grande; riparian; Tamarix; warming	PHREATOPHYTIC VEGETATION; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; GROUNDWATER DEPTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; RESTORATION; VARIABILITY; PLANTS; COTTONWOODS; ECOSYSTEMS	Questions Predicting the influence of climate change on riparian plant communities improves management strategies. The sensitivity of riparian vegetation to climate and other abiotic factors depends on interactions between properties of the ecosystem, like flood regime, and plant characteristics. To explore these interactions, we addressed three questions: (a) does the composition and diversity of riparian vegetation vary with the flood regime; (b) do abiotic correlates of vegetation, including climate and groundwater, differ between sites that flood compared to locations that did not experience floods; and (c) which plant functional groups account for differential plant community sensitivity to abiotic factors between flood regimes? Location Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico. Methods We used long-term observations of plant community composition, groundwater depth, precipitation and interpolated temperature from 24 sites spanning 210 km of the Rio Grande riparian cottonwood-willow forest to explore the relative importance of climate and hydrologic correlates of riparian vegetation diversity and composition. Results Riparian plant diversity was higher at sites flooding compared to non-flooding sites. Plant diversity positively tracked shallower groundwater depth at flooding sites, but was best predicted by intra-annual groundwater variability at non-flooding sites. Plant community composition correlated with groundwater depth and air temperature at all sites, but at non-flooding sites, also with intra-annual groundwater variability and precipitation. Relationships between native plant cover and potential environmental drivers diverged strongly between the two flood regimes; non-native plant cover had only weak relationships with most environmental predictors. Conclusions The current flood regime of a site determined the climate and hydrologic factors that best predicted riparian plant community composition and diversity. Relationships between plant diversity or total cover and groundwater, temperature, precipitation, or groundwater variability can change in strength or direction depending on a site's flood history, highlighting the importance of flood regime to predicting the sensitivity of riparian woodlands to future environmental change.

J	Rimböck, A				Rimboeck, Andreas			State of flood protection in Bavaria	WASSERWIRTSCHAFT			German	Article								Flood protection and risk management is confronted with a variety of challenges due to climate change, awareness of remaining risks, and changing boundary conditions. The complexity of the issues requires a holistic, integrated approach in the form of systems engineering. In Bavaria, this is taken into account for the entire water balance in the new future program "water future Bavaria 2050". The strategy for the waters - both in terms of flood protection and water ecology is an essential part of it. The article provides an overview of the reason for the realigned strategy, its objectives and some new elements in flood risk management in Bavaria.

This study was on the flood inundation of the Chikuma River Basin in Japan caused by Typhoon Hagibis in 2019. The historical warming impact on Typhoon Hagibis was analyzed by comparing nonglobal warming experiments (NonWs) and control experiments (CTLs) to reproduce the current situation. Calculated results showed that the ratios of the index of CTLs to that of NonWs (mean CTL to mean NonW) as indicators of the impact of historical warming were 1.08, 1.22, and 1.08-3.08 for total precipitation, peak river discharge, and peak water level (from pre-flood level and high-water level), respectively, and 48.1 and 595 for overflow depth and inundation volume for the Chikuma River, respectively. Results of the hydrologic-sensitivity analysis indicated that the influence of historical warming during the last 40-year period was already evident on overflow and flooding, whose sensitivities were higher than those of discharge and water level.

Rainfall and sea level drove the expansion of seasonally flooded habitats and associated bird populations across Amazonia	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; CHANNEL PATTERNS; LATE PLEISTOCENE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; EVOLUTION; FOREST; SINGLE; RECORD; BASIN	This study found that millennial periods of higher rainfall combined with rising sea level enhanced sediment accumulation in Amazonian rivers valleys. This fuelled synchronous expansion of vegetation adapted to seasonally flooded substrates and its specialized bird populations, showing how global climate changes can affect specific Amazonian species. Spatial arrangement of distinct Amazonian environments through time and its effect on specialized biota remain poorly known, fueling long-lasting debates about drivers of biotic diversification. We address the late Quaternary sediment deposition that assembled the world's largest seasonally flooded ecosystems. Genome sequencing was used to reconstruct the demographic history of bird species specialized in either early successional vegetation or mature floodplain forests. Sediment deposition that built seasonally flooded habitats accelerated throughout the Holocene (last 11,700 years) under sea level highstand and intensification of the South American Monsoon, at the same time as global increases in atmospheric methane concentration. Bird populations adapted to seasonally flooded habitats expanded due to enlargement of Amazonian river floodplains and archipelagos. Our findings suggest that the diversification of the biota specialized in seasonally flooded habitats is coupled to sedimentary budget changes of large rivers, which rely on combined effects of sea level and rainfall variations.

Here, digital environments can support strategic decisions and planning through visual representations of local climate risks and vulnerabilities. This study targets visualization of vulnerability to heat and floods as a means of supporting adaptation action in preschools, primary schools, caring units, and municipal residential buildings in Norrkoping, Sweden. Workshops with sector leaders identified vulnerability indicators used as a basis for collecting, calculating and representing self-assessed vulnerability of individual units and buildings. Informed by user inputs, a map-based interactive visual tool representing resulting vulnerability scores and risk maps was developed to support (1) planners and sector leaders in strategic prioritization and investments, and (2) unit heads in identifying adaptation measures to reduce local flood and heat risks. The tool was tested with adaptation coordinators from targeted sectors. The study finds that the tool made it possible to overview climate risks and adaptation measures, which arguably increases general governance capacity Allowing yearly updates of set scores, the tool was also found to be useful for monitoring how vulnerability in the municipality evolves over time, and for evaluating how adaptive efforts influence calculated risks.

A second-order attention network for glacial lake segmentation from remotely sensed imagery	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Deep learning; GLOF; Satellite imagery; Climate change; Landsat; Self-attention mechanism	DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; OUTBURST FLOODS; EXTRACTION; ALGORITHM; FEATURES; PLATEAU; NDWI	Climate change is increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in many of the world's most vulnerable and high mountain regions. Simultaneously, remote sensing technologies now facilitate continuous monitoring of glacial lake evolution around the globe, although accurate and reliable automated glacial lake mapping from satellite data remains challenging. In this study, a Second-order Attention Network (SoAN) is devised for the automated segmentation of lakes from satellite imagery. In particular, a novel Second-order Attention Module (SoAM) is proposed to capture the long-range spatial dependencies and establish channel attention derived from the covariance representations of local features. Furthermore, as the dimensions of the input and output tensors are identical and it simply relies on matrix calculations, the proposed SoAM can be embedded into different positions of a given architecture while maintaining similar reference speed. The designed network is implemented on Landsat-8 imagery and outputs are compared against representative deep learning models, demonstrating improved results with a Dice of 81.02% and a F2 Score of 85.17%.

Unless preventive measures are taken, the costs are expected to increase in future due to ongoing climate change. However, the risk reduction measures are costly as well and may result in unwanted impacts. Therefore, it is important to identify, assess and prioritize which measures are necessary to undertake, as well as where and when these are to be undertaken. To be able to make such evaluations, robust (scientifically based), transparent and systematic assessments and valuations are required. This article describes a framework to assess the cause-and-effect relationships and how to estimate the costs and benefits as a basis to assess and prioritize measures for climate adaptation of roads and railways. The framework includes hazard identification, risk analysis and risk assessment, identification, monetary and non-monetary evaluation of possible risk reduction measures and a step regarding distribution-, goal- and sensitivity analyses. The results from applying the framework shall be used to prioritize among potential risk reduction measures as well as when to undertake them.

This study analyzed spatiotemporal characteristics of five types of AMDs (drought, flood, hail, low-temperature freezing and snow (LTFS), and typhoon) in China, assessed the impacts of AMDs on meteorological yield, and explored the influences of extreme climate on AMDs and meteorological yield. The results demonstrated that the total covered rate of AMDs generally showed a decreasing trend from 1978 to 2020 in China. The covered rates of drought, flood, and hail had significant downward trends, while the covered rates of the LTFS and typhoons had insignificant increasing trends. The AMDs' structure in different regions obviously changed after 2010. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the covered rates of drought, flood, and typhoon were affected by the extreme precipitation indicators, and hail and LTFS were affected by the extreme temperature indicators. The increases of extreme temperature led to the decrease of the meteorological yield, while the effect of extreme precipitation on meteorological yield varied from region to region. This study provides significant references for guiding disaster mitigation.

It is important to identify the factors affecting the decision-making process during evacuation. The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that influence evacuation decision-making in flood-prone rural communities along the Indus River in Dera Ismail Khan. A total of 465 household surveys were conducted in high flood-risk areas along the river to gather data on evacuation characteristics and risk perception. Pearson's correlation technique was utilised to determine the relationship between flood risk perception indicators and the likelihood of evacuation, while a binary logistic regression test was implemented to identify the socio-economic factors that influence evacuation. The results of the study indicated that socio-economic conditions and risk perceptions can have a direct or indirect effect on evacuation decisions. It was found that those living in closer to the river tended to have a lower risk perception. However, respondents in the study reported experiencing high levels of fear in regard to floods. Age and proximity to hazards were identified as significant factors that impact willingness to evacuate. These findings suggest the need for urgent implementation of awareness campaigns in settlements located near the river in order to promote evacuation.

The polje is subject to frequent flooding, becoming more problematic since 2000, as swallow holes more frequently have affected housing and recreational areas, leading the population to believe that their ability in draining the area had stopped functioning. Climate changes play an important role as there has been an intensification in extreme events (30-day cumulative precipitation of more than 350 mm) within the considered time-period 1919-2020. The necessity to provide answers to the inhabitants required in-depth studies such as hydrogeological investigations, discharge measurements and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) acquisitions. Over the 3 years of monitoring (2017-2020), two flood events reached the Selz settlement. In total, four events have been analysed to build a hydrogeological model of the area in order to properly estimate its recharge and regression curve, and to define the functionalities of the swallow holes. The defined model allowed a better knowledge and a greater awareness in proposing the proper mitigation measures able to increase the drainage capacity of the area avoiding always more frequent future floodings.

Urban flooding is exacerbated by climate change, urbanization, growing population, and the increase of impervious surfaces in urban areas. Stormwater drainage systems that discharge stormwater to a safe location in urban areas are becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study is to analyze and calibrate the flood performance of stormwater drainage systems currently used in the central region of Malatya in a potential flood situation using geographic information systems and the InfoWorks ICM. The model was created using the land use type, buildings, and digital elevation model (DEM), and the analysis was performed by exposing stormwater drainage systems to rainfall events of 5, 10, and 15 min of duration for return periods of 2, 5, and 10 years. The model was then validated using field-observed rainfall and flood data and its performance was evaluated using R2, NSE, RMSE, and MAE metrics. The results showed that the eight stormwater drainage systems currently in operation cannot fully convey stormwater and may pose a risk of loss of life and property in residential areas. In addition, the severity of the flooding was found to increase with an increasing return period.

The Sierra Nevada of California, United States, experienced some of the driest and wettest years on record in the early 21st Century, with variability in annual precipitation predicted to increase with climate change. We examined the relationship between adult occupancy dynamics of three high elevation anurans and site and annual variation in measures of winter severity, summer wetness, and cumulative drought. We further evaluated how these weather conditions affected the probability that each species would reproduce, conditional on their occurrence at a site. We found that although different aspects of weather affected the occupancy dynamics of each species differently, adult occupancy probabilities were generally stable throughout our 15-year study period. The probability of reproduction, although slightly more variable than adult occupancy, was similarly stable throughout the study. Although occurrence of the three species was resilient to recent extremes in precipitation, more detailed demographic study would inform the extent to which amphibian populations will remain resilient to increasing severity, duration, and frequency of drought and flood cycles.

The present paper attempts to characterise extreme rainfalls responsible for pluvial floods in the city of Niamey, in Niger, under climate change and rapid population growth. Past damaging rainfall records spanning 1992-2015 were used to estimate the optimal temporal scale and to define a threshold for extreme rainfall. The characteristics of extreme rainfalls were then assessed under stationary and non-stationary conditions using peaks over threshold (POT) with the generalised pareto distribution (GDP). In the non-stationary POT, population data was used as threshold covariate whereas air temperature was used as scale parameter covariate. A suitable temporal scale of 3 h was found, whereas the threshold depth was 28.71 mm under stationary conditions and between 21 and 27 mm for the time dependent threshold. The analysis of the extreme rainfall series revealed no significant trend neither in the magnitude nor in the frequency. The influence of air temperature in the characterization of extreme rainfall were less compared to rapid urbanisation, represented herein by population growth. By 2040, 3-hourly rainfall depths of 20 mm could be considered as extreme rainfall.

Investigating global megacities' increased disposition to flooding will aid in developing sustainable flood-risk-management frameworks. Many studies have been conducted on the association between land-cover types and flood consequences, but few on investigating urban expansion patterns' correlation with flood hazard and risk. This study examines the correlation between urban expansion patterns and increased flood hazards. Twelve megacities throughout the world were selected for this study. After exploring the possibility of the megacities having experienced flooding, we qualified their patterns of urban expansion and their potential to influence the elements of flood risk. Our results revealed that edge expansion and leapfrogging patterns had a strong positive correlation with statistical significance with flood hazard, while infilling had a weak positive correlation that showed no statistical significance with flood hazard. Further, we found that the megacities have all experienced devastating floods in the past two decades. Flood risk frameworks need to account for the impact of these patterns, and future urban planning designs and policies need to incorporate flood risk frameworks that account for patterns of urban expansion.

This makes an implicit assumption that the drivers of risk, other than the hazard, remain constant with time. Therefore, such risk assessment does not provide a realistic outlook for devising plausible mitigation strategies and plans. In this study, flood risk was assessed from an integrated perspective by considering both physical hazard, and socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability-all changing with time. The flood hazard in the Arial Khan River floodplain in the southcentral Bangladesh was simulated with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, and the exposure and vulnerability were projected using different statistical techniques. Principal component analysis was conducted to assign weights to the indicators of hazard, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results show that the flood depth, duration, and extent would increase from the baseline to 2080s under regional concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The sensitivity and vulnerability would decrease, reflecting an improved adaptive capacity. The low-risk areas could increase from 62% in the baseline to 85%-91% in 2080s depending on the RCPs. The approach followed can be applied elsewhere in developing countries, particularly in riverine floodplain settings.	[Chyon, Md Sadiul Alam; Biswas, Subir; Mondal, M.

Seasonal drivers of dissolved oxygen across a tidal creek-marsh interface revealed by machine learning	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							FRESH-WATER; CARBON; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; SEAWATER; CLIMATE	Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key biogeochemical control in coastal systems, and its concentration and drivers vary markedly through time and space. This makes it difficult to accurately represent coastal DO and associated biogeochemical processes in models, limiting our ability to predict how these systems will respond to global change. We obtained high-frequency (5-min) in situ measurements of DO collected at three locations across the interface of a tidal creek and coastal marsh in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Random Forest machine learning models quantified the importance of three categories of environmental drivers (Aquatic, Climatic, and Terrestrial) of DO variability across the creek-marsh interface. We selected two 4-month datasets representing Summer and Winter seasonal periods to test two hypotheses on the dominant drivers of DO at the coastal interface. We found that the Terrestrial driver-characterized by long periods of anaerobic conditions and episodic pulses in DO after floods-was most important during the Winter, whereas the Aquatic driver-characterized by variability over tidal, diel, and lunar cycles-was most important during the Summer. We explored how future climate change scenarios could alter the drivers of DO variability using a cumulative sums driver-response framework. Our results suggest that under climate change, Aquatic and Climatic drivers may increase in importance during the Summer, potentially linked to changing metabolic regimes and sea level, with Terrestrial driver importance potentially increasing during the Winter. Our approach highlights useful methods for understanding the spatiotemporal complexity of oxygen across coastal interfaces and quantifying the relative importance of distinct environmental drivers.

Flooded rice paddy soils are a predominant source of methane (CH4) emissions, accounting for approximately 11 % of global emissions. Factors such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar, transplanting date, water management, and soil characteristics significantly influence these emissions. This study aimed to evaluate the CH4 emissions from rice paddies in relation to the cultivar and transplanting date. The experiment included two rice cultivars (an early-maturing cultivar, Unkwang, and a medium-late-maturing cultivar, Samkwang) and four transplanting dates (Times 1-4). In the present study, CH4 emissions were higher with earlier transplanting dates and decreased significantly with delayed transplanting. Weather conditions, such as cumulative mean air temperature, cumulative soil temperature, and total sunshine hours, were positively correlated with total CH4 emissions. The recommended regional transplanting date (Time 3) resulted in the highest rice grain yields for both cultivars. However, the earlier transplanting dates (Time 1 and Time 2) were more effective in improving plant growth characteristics such as rice straw weight, root biomass weight, and chlorophyll content. A significant positive correlation was observed between the root biomass weight of the rice and CH4 emissions in both cultivars, implying that an increase in root biomass weight led to an increase in CH4 emissions. Consequently, adhering to the advised regional transplanting dates is the most sensible approach for transplanting rice seedlings. This ensured lower CH4 emissions without compromising rice productivity or quality for both cultivars. Further research should focus on identifying the most appropriate rice-transplanting dates and management practices to effectively reduce CH4 emissions without compromising rice production.

Data from global or nested regional climate models (GCMs/RCMs) are frequently used to drive hydrological models, but now there are also very high-resolution convection-permitting models (CPMs). Here, data from the first CPM climate ensemble for the UK, along with the RCM ensemble within which the CPM is nested, are used to drive a grid-based hydrological model. The performance for simulating baseline (1981-2000) river flows is compared between the RCM and the CPM, and the projections of future changes in seasonal mean flows and peak flows are compared across Britain (1981-2000 to 2061-2080). The baseline performance assessment shows that (before bias correction) the CPM generally performs better than the RCM, and bias correction of precipitation makes both the RCM and CPM perform more similarly to use of observation-based driving data. The analysis of future changes in flows shows that the CPM almost always gives higher flow changes than the RCM. If reliable, these differences in flow projections suggest that adaptation planning for high flows based on use of regional data may be insufficient, although planning for low flows may be slightly over-cautious. However, the availability of CPM data only for one RCM/GCM is a limitation for use in adaptation as it under-samples the uncertainty range. There are significant challenges to the wider application of CPM ensembles, including the high computational and data storage demands.

Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park (CU 100) was established to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially flood prevention. This study focused on quantifying the ecosystem services provided by the trees in the park in terms of regulating and provisioning services. A publicly available tool, the i-Tree Eco international software, was used with data obtained from a local weather station as proxies to determine the accuracy of the analysis. Services, quantified in terms of monetary value, included avoided runoff, carbon storage, carbon sequestration, pollution removal, and timber price. The total monetary benefits, obtained from 697 trees (56 species, 49 genera, and 22 families), were estimated at USD 101,400. Of the total services, provisioning services contributed 75% to the total monetary value. Among all regulating services, the avoided runoff contributed about 60%, which was considered as the goal achieved by the park design. Azadirachta indica A. Juss (USD 518.75/tree(-1)/year(-1)), Shorea roxburghii G. Don (USD 417.17/tree(-1)/year(-1)) and Millettia leucantha Kurz (USD 414.87/tree(-1)/year(-1)) provided the greatest benefit, as indicated by a high value of provisioning services in terms of a high timber quality. These results can be used when planning the composition of trees to be planted in urban areas to increase both green spaces and maximize ecosystem services to improve the vitality of human well-being.

Although jute is particularly adapted to grow in hot and humid climates, it is grown under a wide variety of climatic conditions and is relatively tolerant to some environmental adversities. However, abiotic stress often restricts its growth, yield, and quality significantly. Abiotic stress negatively affects the metabolic activities, growth, physiology, and fiber yield of jute. One of the major consequences of abiotic stress on the jute plant is the generation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to oxidative stress that damages its cellular organelles and biomolecules. However, jute's responses to abiotic stress mainly depend on the plant's age and type and duration of stress. Therefore, understanding the abiotic stress responses and the tolerance mechanism would help plant biologists and agronomists in developing climate-smart jute varieties and suitable cultivation packages for adverse environmental conditions. In this review, we summarized the best possible recent literature on the plant abiotic stress factors and their influence on jute plants. We described the possible approaches for stress tolerance mechanisms based on the available literature.	[Rahman, Khussboo; Ahmed, Naznin; Raihan, Md.

J	Lei, T; Middleton, B				Lei, Ting; Middleton, Beth			A US-China EcoPartnership study of disturbed wetland vegetation in West Dongting Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						climate change; hydrology; plant diversity; regeneration potential; surface elevation	WATER-LEVEL; SEDIMENT; DAM	West Dongting Lake in China is important for human livelihoods and habitat of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife. The waterway re-engineering and agriculture intensification have contributed to changes in hydrology, sediment, and vegetation on the floodplain. This paper describes an EcoPartnership program conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey, Wetland and Aquatic Research Center, and Beijing Forestry University. It focused on the development of a wetland ecosystem network in West Dongting Lake with technical support from the U.S. partner using a number of related studies to examine wetland vegetation dynamics from upstream to downstream along the tributaries. The results of U.S. studies showed that the regeneration potential of species might be altered by changes in climate and local environment, and seed bank depletion by germination may be a major conservation threat in a future with recurring droughts in swamps of the southeastern United States. In the monsoonal wetlands of West Dongting Lake, the soil seed bank could be used as a seed source for revegetation after hydrologic restoration with the introduction of certain foundational species and the removal of poplar plantations. Also, West Dongting Lake is at high ecological risk of mercury pollution. Wetland ecosystem monitoring may allow managers to use the information to predict effects of climate change, water level and flow changes on sedimentation, and to manage for desired vegetation to support waterfowl and ecosystem services. The cooperation of two countries through the EcoPartnership program is now well established and poised for extensive research projects in the future.

Thus, it is of foremost importance to, within a disaster risk-reduction strategy, develop a useful flood forecast and alert system to prevent people from suffering flood disasters and mitigate its consequences. This article presents the Flood Forecast and Alert System in operational mode since 2019 for the ' Agueda river basin located in Portugal's centre region. This system is technologically advanced, differing from others since it uses a coupled real-time hydrologic and 2D hydrodynamic modelling supported on numerical weather prediction and a high-resolution digital terrain surface model. The system components are automatically activated and linked: i) a rainfall forecasting model (WRF), ii) a hydrological model (HEC-HMS), iii) a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS 2D), and a iv) Web-GIS platform. The hydrological model is forced with forecast precipitation for the next three days and updated every 6 h, which is crucial to generate pre-flood hazard maps. It also includes a Web GIS service for flood hazard dissemination available for civil authorities and citizens. A flood forecast and alert system is highly relevant to the community since, by enhancing knowledge, it provides the authorities responsible for assessing and managing the flood risk, responsiveness to disasters and timely decisionmaking, which is even more evident in the context of climate change.

Evaluation of CMIP6 models in simulating the statistics of extreme precipitation over Eastern Africa	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						ETCCDI; CMIP6; Rainfall; Extreme events; Climate change	CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES	The Eastern Africa region experiences frequent extreme precipitation events that can cause destruction of property and environment, and loss of lives. Thus, there is a need to understand how these events may change in the future and how well the global climate models that are used to make projections can simulate precipitation extremes in this region before they can be used in downscaling or flood and drought impact assessment studies. In this work, we evaluated the ability of sixteen Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models to simulate present-day precipitation extremes over the Eastern Africa region during the two rainy seasons (March?May and September?November). We used nine extreme precipitation indices (including seven (one) indices of wet (dry) extremes) defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. The CMIP6 models were evaluated against two gridded observation datasets: Global Precipitation Climatology Project OneDegree Daily Dataset and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42. Three model performance metrics (percentage bias, normalized root-mean-square error, and pattern correlation coefficient) were employed to further assess the strengths and weakness of the models. Our results show that the multi-model ensemble mean generally provides a better representation of observed precipitation and related extremes compared to individual models when considering all metrics and seasons. Several consistent biases are evident across CMIP6 models, which tend to overestimate the total-wet day precipitation and consecutive wet days, and underestimate very wet days and maximum 5-day precipitation in both seasons. Furthermore, no single model consistently performs best, model performance varies with the season and index under consideration and is generally independent of horizontal resolution.

Probabilistic Projections of Multidimensional Flood Risks at a Convection-Permitting Scale	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							PAIR-COPULA CONSTRUCTIONS; BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STATIONARITY; FRAMEWORK; ROBUSTNESS; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE; STREAMFLOW; SCENARIOS	Understanding future river flood risk is a prerequisite for developing climate change adaptation strategies and enhancing disaster resilience. Previous flood risk assessments can barely take into account future changes of fine-scale hydroclimatic characteristics and hardly quantify multivariate interactions among flood variables, thereby resulting in an unreliable assessment of flood risk. In this study, for the first time, we develop probabilistic projections of multidimensional river flood risks at a convection-permitting scale through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Vine copula has been widely used to assess the multidimensional dependence structure of hydroclimate variables, but the commonly used frequentist approach may fail to identify the correct vine model and to obtain the uncertainty interval. Thus, a Bayesian vine copula approach is proposed to explicitly address the multidimensional dependence of flood characteristics (i.e., flood peak, volume, and duration) and underlying uncertainties. The proposed approach enables a robust assessment of return periods of future floods for Guadalupe and Mission river basins located in South Texas of the United States. Our findings reveal that the South Texas region is projected to experience more flood events with longer duration and greater discharge volume. The flood peak, however, will not necessarily increase even though precipitation extremes are expected to become more frequent. The projected flood return periods over the Guadalupe river basin do not show an obvious increase while the Mission river basin is projected to face a dramatic increase in flood risk with exposed to 100-year and even severer floods nearly every 2 years, on average, when considering the combined effects of flood peak, volume, and duration.

Their impact can be indicated by changes on streamflow, which is quantifiable using process-based streamflow modelling of baseline and future scenarios. Here we include the uncertainty and associated risk of the streamflow changes for a robust impact assessment to agriculture. We created a baseline model and models of CC and LULCC "impact scenarios" that use: (1) the new climate projections until 2070 and (2) land cover scenarios worsened by forest loss, in a critical watershed in the Philippines. Simulations of peak flows by 26% and low flows by 63% from the baseline model improved after calibrating runoff, soil evaporation, and groundwater parameters. Using the calibrated model, impacts of both CC and LULCC in 2070 were indicated by water deficit (- 18.65%) from May to August and water surplus (12.79%) from November to December. Both CC and LULCC contributed almost equally to the deficit, but the surplus was more LULCC-driven. Risk from CC may affect 9.10% of the croplands equivalent to 0.31 million dollars, while both CC and LULCC doubled the croplands at risk (19.13%, 0.60 million dollars) in one cropping season. The findings warn for the inevitable cropping schedule adjustments in the coming decades, which both apply to irrigated and rainfed crops, and may have implications to crop yields. This study calls for better watershed management to mitigate the risk to crop production and even potential flood risks.

J	Adams, JB				Adams, Janine Barbara			Salt marsh at the tip of Africa: Patterns, processes and changes in response to climate change	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Area cover; Habitat; South Africa; Estuary; Temporarily closed; Drought	SEA-LEVEL RISE; TEMPORARILY OPEN/CLOSED ESTUARY; GREAT BRAK ESTUARY; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; MANGROVE EXPANSION; EUTROPHIC CONDITION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SWARTKOPS ESTUARY; COASTAL WETLANDS; CARBON STORAGE	This study developed a conceptual understanding of climate change responses of salt marsh in open and closed estuaries and outlined changes in terms of implications for ecosystem services. Changes in salt marsh cover in South Africa were described in relation to prevailing pressures. Salt marshes occur in the sheltered estuaries distributed along the similar to 3000 km coastline. Supratidal salt marsh occurs at elevation greater than 1.5 m amsl and are dominant in the cool temperate (5328.28 ha) and intertidal salt marsh in the warm temperate region (2093.31 ha). Although small in total extent (14 955 ha), salt marshes play a central role in biodiversity conservation because they provide critical habitat for migratory fish and birds. Approximately 43% of salt marsh habitat has been lost due to encroaching development and agriculture from the 1930s to 2018. In addition, salinisation and desiccation resulting from upstream freshwater abstraction reduces freshwater inflow, which extends periods of mouth closure in temporarily closed estuaries causing inundation and flooding of salt marsh. Predicting the combined effects of multiple stressors (increase in storm surges, floods, droughts and reduced river flow) is critical to conserve these important habitats. Research and monitoring to understand salt marsh responses is ongoing because the interface between the subtropical and warm temperate coastal regions of South Africa is expected to be affected by mangrove range expansion. This study is globally relevant as little is known about southern hemisphere salt marshes in Africa and data are needed for comparative purposes.

J	Haque, S; Akbar, D; Kinnear, S				Haque, Sabrina; Akbar, Delwar; Kinnear, Susan			The variable impacts of extreme weather events on fruit production in subtropical Australia	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Climate change; Sub-tropical Australia; Horticulture and regression model	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CROPS	The frequency and severity of extreme weather events (EWEs) has recently been increased in coastal subtropical regions in Australia. These EWEs particularly affect agricultural production through disruptions to the entire agricultural supply chain. Central Queensland (CQ) is a large sub-tropical region in Australia and has been frequently affected by various types of EWES, particularly since 1999. This study examines the impact of EWES on the production of three tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, mango and lychee) in CQ. Meteorological and fruit production data were collected from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and Australian Bureau of Statistics respectively. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was used to identify the relationship(s) between EWEs and the production volumes of the three selected fruits. This study found that EWEs moderately affected mango, lychee and pineapple production. A significant relationship was also observed between the fruit production volume and population growth of CQ as well as that of the broader state of Queensland. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given that this case study was limited to localised flood data, rather than using comprehensive modelling of regional rainfall and other variables, which would better reflect the geography and climate of the fruit production areas. The results derived from this study would be beneficial for tropical fruit industries worldwide, as they make plans to response to increasingly extreme weather; with a key finding being the important of understanding not only the occurrence, but also the seasonality of EWES and comparing this with the growing and harvesting periods for global fruit production.

These diseases are responsible for increasing morbidity and mortality and lead to other stresses within the population. Such stresses create continuous impacts on the health and well-being of the population, compounding their vulnerability and inhibiting their capacity to cope with frequent event-related shocks, such as floods and drought. A systems approach is taken to examine four important environmental hazards in Bangladesh-arsenic contamination of drinking water, arsenic transmission through the food chain, indoor air quality, and air pollution. A review of these hazards is presented in a conceptual framework that links human well-being with the key system components of infrastructure, institutions, knowledge, and behavior. This reveals key underlying factors between the hazards and uncovers system structures that can lead to more effective hazard mitigation, and the establishment of strategic intervention points. The article concludes that elimination of these continuous stresses will only come about through the culmination of multiple interventions over time, undertaken in an iterative manner that builds on the continual advancement of hazard understanding. The role of individual behaviors, together with factors such as risk awareness and perception of the hazards, has been identified as crucial for achieving successful mitigation solutions. Improved knowledge of the hazards, public awareness, and government accountability are focus points to reduce population exposure and enhance response capacity.

However, paleoclimate reconstruction in the Yangtze Delta covering MIS 3 remains elusive due to limited archives with reliable age. Here, we derived a 53,000-year-long paleoclimate record from the northern Yangtze Delta, using luminescence age-based palynological data of a coastal sediment core (YZ07). The results show that the climate was relatively warm and wet during similar to 53.0-37.5 ka, followed by a slightly cool but wetter condition between similar to 37.5 ka and similar to 33.2 ka. Afterwards, a cool and dry climate prevailed from similar to 33.2 ka to similar to 30.7 ka. Three cold events were identified around 48.0 ka, 39.0 ka and 31.0 ka, corresponding to the timings of Heinrich Event (HE 5), HE 4 and HE 3, respectively. From similar to 30.7 ka to similar to 11.5 ka, broadleaved forests and wetland herbs obviously contracted in the Yangtze Delta region, indicating cold and dry climate conditions. From the late Pleistocene to Holocene, the pollen variations in this core site were linked to coastal geomorphology under climate-induced sea-level changes. Besides, our findings suggest that the percentages of emergent vegetation in this work were negatively correlated with El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-linked flood events during the Holocene. Overall, from mid-MIS 3 to MIS 2, the climate exhibits a 'warm-cool-cold' pattern in the Yangtze Delta, broadly concordant with other climate proxies in East Asian monsoon domain and beyond on suborbital or millennial timescales. We argue that the northern hemisphere summer insolation may be responsible for the paleoclimate variability and paleovegetation successions in the Yangtze Delta. However, the variability of precipitation in MIS 3 might be governed by interhemispheric insolation forcing, which accounts for a wetter climate phase occurring during late MIS 3 rather than mid-MIS 3.

Restoration and resilience to sea level rise of a salt marsh affected by dieback events	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						dieback; drought; elevation; resilience; salt marsh; sea level rise; urban ecosystem	SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; COASTAL MARSHES; R PACKAGE; ELEVATION; DROUGHT; MODEL; CORDGRASS; RESPONSES; CAROLINA; WETLANDS	The frequency of salt marsh dieback events has increased over the last 25 years with unknown consequences to the resilience of the ecosystem to accelerated sea level rise (SLR). Salt marsh ecosystems impacted by sudden vegetation dieback events were previously thought to recover naturally within a few months to years. In this study, we used a 13-year collection of remotely sensed imagery to provide evidence that approximately 14% of total marsh area has not revegetated 10 years after a dieback event in Charleston, SC. Dieback onset coincided with a severe drought in 2012, as indicated by the Palmer drought stress index. A second dieback event occurred in 2016 after a historic flood influenced by Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Unvegetated zones reached nearly 30% of the total marsh area in 2017. We used a light detection and ranging-derived digital elevation model to determine that most affected areas were associated with lower elevation zones in the interior of the marsh. Further, restoration by grass planting was effective, with pilot-scale restored plots having greater aboveground biomass than reference sites after two years of transplanting. A positive outcome indicated that the stressors that caused the dieback are no longer present. Despite that, many affected areas have not recovered naturally, even though they are located within the typical elevation range of healthy marshes. A mechanistic modeling approach was used to assess the effects of vegetation dieback on salt marsh resilience to SLR. Predictions indicate that a highly productive restored marsh (2000 g m(-2) year(-1)) would persist at a moderate SLR rate of 60 cm in 100 years, whereas a nonrestored mudflat would lose all its elevation capital after 100 years. Thus, rapid restoration of marsh dieback is critical to avoid further degradation. Also, failure to incorporate the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events that trigger irreversible marsh diebacks underestimates salt marsh vulnerability to climate change. Finally, at an elevated SLR rate of 122 cm in 100 years, which is most likely an extreme climate change scenario, even highly productive ecosystems augmented by sediment placement would not keep pace with SLR. Thus, climate change mitigation actions are also urgently needed to preserve present-day marsh ecosystems.	[Rolando, J. L.; Garcia, K. D.; Krueger, G.; Kostka, J.

However, high-resolution time-series data related to the histories of climatic changes in these areas are limited. Therefore, this multiproxy analysis of a sediment core from the Baidunzi wetland, northwest China, was conducted using grain size, total organic carbon, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), and molecular biomarkers. The results show that GDGTs can reliably reconstruct paleoclimate changes recorded in sediments in salt marsh environments. The climate and environment history of the past 800 years can be divided into the three stages: the end of the dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) (1278???1366 CE), a humid Little Ice Age (LIA) (1366???1896 CE), and the humid Current Warm Period (CWP) (1896???1999 CE). The Baidunzi setting during the end of the MWP was a warm and dry wetland with high salinity, low water levels, and emersed aquatic plants, and the depositional environment transitioned from fluvial facies to shore lake facies. In contrast, the local climate during the LIA was cold and humid, and the era was characterized by the appearance of vascular flora and two short-term flooding events, that caused a rise in water levels. The lowest temperatures and highest salinities of the period were correlated, which was likely caused by seasonal freeze-thaw cycles. During the CWP, the local climate was warm and humid, with a higher water level than during the LIA, and emersed plants again developed in shallow lagoon facies. Generally, salinity was positively correlated with temperature, except for freezing and thawing salinization resulting from episodes of extremely low temperatures. The warm???dry to cold???humid climate changes of the area were like those of arid Central Asia, which indicates that the Baidunzi region was affected mainly by the Westerlies and was impacted by southward intrusions of that system. The area was also affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation and experienced diminished evaporation during periods of cold climate.

J	Muñoz, DS; García, JLD				Sanchez Munoz, Daniel; Dominguez Garcia, Jose Luis			GIS-based tool development for flooding impact assessment on electrical sector	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Electrical substation; GIS; Risk assessment; Cost assessment; Flooding; Resilience	RISK-ASSESSMENT; RAINFALL-RUNOFF; INUNDATION	Due to climate change, extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity. Thus, critical infrastructures as power distribution must be secure and resilient to respond to and mitigate the impacts caused by extreme events. Accounting that the most valuable assets, human lives, are currently hosted in cities, these are considered as the most sensible and critical zones and are also constituted as the main focus of study. This statement is reflected in the increasing interest in making cities more resilient against extreme events, becoming a key research topic worldwide. Trying to tackle this goal, this paper focuses on the development of a GIS-based tool oriented to help decision-makers in planning while providing unitary and global views of the electric assets of a network considering their interrelations in a failure case. The study follows three main steps to achieve this purpose. First, the flood risk assessment while evaluating the flood depth hazard (taking into account the Average of Water Depth found in the flooded areas), the exposure of the assets (using Affected Area Rates), and their vulnerability (with the integration of Fragility curves), putting all the elements together into Failure Probabilities considering the interrelation between assets and the potential cascade effects. Second, calculating a cost assessment (from damage, business interruption, auxiliary cost, and non-supplied energy). Finally, calculating electrical network reliability indices, which provides highly valuable information about the status of the grid and the interruptions to customers when considering scenarios of extreme flooding events. Intending to prove the use and performance of the tool developed, this tool is applied to a real case study in Barcelona city. This case of study is constituted by two flooding scenarios (Current situation and Climate change with RCP 8.5) previously modeled and validated in other projects, and the Climate change scenario with measures applied to the water sector (increasing the drainage capacity of the city, and improving capacities of the sewer system). It is demonstrated how the improvements introduced by measures are interrelated and considerably improve the safety of the electrical network, mitigating consequences provoked by flooding extreme events by 60% in case of Average of Water Depth, 50% the failure probability, and 77% the costs provoked.

A sudden pattern alteration from a "white river" (bare soils) to a "green river" (vegetated) influences riverine biodiversity and can increase flood risk. Despite these significant impacts, knowledge on the triggers that kickstart feedback exacerbating changes in bio-geomorphic patterns is insufficient. In this study, we collected and analyzed detailed monitoring data on a sandy, hydro-morphologically active, and monsoon-driven river in Korea. The surface area covered by vegetation has been increasing; this increase intensified after the 2014-2015 drought, which provided a window of opportunity for vegetation establishment. During the drought, pioneer vegetation densely colonized bare sandbars and temporarily exposed riverbed. Despite partial rejuvenation by several subsequent floods, succession to woody vegetation occurred, resulting in a stable vegetation cover. Narrowing and incision of a low-water channel occurred, and secondary channels formed inside the floodplain. The results of this study show a rapid bio-geomorphic alteration triggered by the shifts in flow regime in a river primed by human-induced changes. Furthermore, modified monsoon-driven rivers might be on the brink of similar bio-physical alterations triggered through shifting flow regime following climate change, leading to increased flood risk and impacts on endemic biodiversity.

Although some approaches distinguish the climate action from anthropogenic influence on hydrological regimes in large basins, few methods propose to separate the climate effects from the regulation consequences of unique/few dams. This paper presents a new method to quantify effects of HPP and climate change/land use under the main altered river regime components, which is based on flow duration curves. The method was applied in the Grande River (Brazil), which is regulated by a large reservoir (with surface area > 70 km(2)). The indicators of hydrological alterations and the range of variability approach indicated that all drivers' effects promoted a moderate alteration in five regime components. The Itutinga-Camargos HPP implications were the major driver, with a contribution higher than 90% in every component, and it was responsible for a 0.28 x 10(9) m(3) year(-1) reduction in water superficial availability downstream. The flow regimes in headwater watersheds can be highly sensitive to dam operations, but other factors may aggravate their effects on river dynamics. The quantification of anthropogenic actions has possible applicability in other systems worldwide to assess the ecosystem services of flow regimes.

Flooding stress curtails soybean growth, yield, and quality and ultimately threatens the global food supply chain. Flooding tolerance is a multigenic trait. Tremendous research in molecular breeding explored the potential genomic regions governing flood tolerance in soybean. The most robust way to develop flooding tolerance in soybean is by using molecular methods, including quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, identification of transcriptomes, transcription factor analysis, CRISPR/Cas9, and to some extent, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and multi-omics techniques. These powerful molecular tools have deepened our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of flooding stress tolerance. Besides all this, using conventional breeding methods (hybridization, introduction, and backcrossing) and other agronomic practices is also helpful in combating the rising flooding threats to the soybean crop. The current review aims to summarize recent advancements in breeding flood-tolerant soybean, mainly by using molecular and conventional tools and their prospects. This updated picture will be a treasure trove for future researchers to comprehend the foundation of flooding tolerance in soybean and cover the given research gaps to develop tolerant soybean cultivars able to sustain growth under extreme climatic changes.

Hence, historical design storms require revisions based on robust intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships. To this end, the development of an urban rain-gauge network is essential to yield the spatiotemporal attributes of rainfall. The present study addresses two objectives: (a) to reconstruct sub-daily rainfall time series for the historical period over an urban gauge network, and (b) to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in extreme rainfall distribution within a city. This study considers Bangalore, India, where rainfall has been historically monitored by two stations but a dense gauge network has recently been developed. The study applies random forest regression for rainfall reconstruction, finding that the performance of the model is better when the predictand and predictor stations are near to one another. Robust IDF relationships confirm significant spatial variations in extreme rainfall distribution at the station and the city-region levels. The areal reduction factor (ARF) is also estimated in order to understand the likely impact of the reconstructed time series on hydrological modeling. A significant decrease in the ARF is observed as the area grows beyond 450 km(2), indicating a substantial reduction in the volume of the design floods.	[Joseph, Risma; Mujumdar, P.

This same region is home to offshore oil/gas activities. Foggy Island Bay is one region along the Beaufort Sea coast with planned offshore oil/gas development that will need to account for the changing climate. High water levels impact infrastructure through coastal erosion and flooding hazards. In this study, 21 high water level events exceeding the top 95th percentile were identified at the gauge in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska (adjacent to Foggy Island Bay) over 1990-2018. All 21 events, and many non-extreme days with elevated water levels, were associated with strong westerly winds according to station records. Storm systems were generally found to be a key driver of westerly winds in the region according to downscaled reanalysis and storm track data. A dynamically downscaled global climate model projection from CMIP5 indicated that days with westerly wind events may become more frequent as storms strengthen and have longer durations by 2100 in the Foggy Island Bay region. Coupled with the anticipated continued decline in sea ice, the northern coast of Alaska may experience more frequent high water events over the next similar to 80 years.

Previous studies have reported that conventional ML models fail to accurately simulate extreme flows which are crucial for design flood estimation and associated risk analysis in the context of climate change. Therefore, this study proposes a joint probabilistic rainfall-runoff model (JPRR) for improving high-to-extreme flow projection. With the aid of paired copula constructions, bootstrap aggregation, and multi-model ensemble approaches, the proposed model is able to effectively characterize the dependence relationships of predictors (i.e., precipitation time series with different moving sums) with various probability distributions. JPRR has been applied to four pristine basins in China, representing different climate zones and landscapes. The results reveal that JPRR significantly outperforms three well-known ML models (i.e., random forest, artificial neural networks, and long short-term memory) in high-to-extreme flow simulations. In JPRR, the copulas exhibiting the right tail dependence play a more important role in streamflow simulations at mountainous basins. Moreover, a significant difference in streamflow projections (from 2030 to 2099) derived from JPRR and benchmark models imply that flood risks from conventional ML models may be underestimated under changing climatic conditions.

Here, we apply a simple statistical framework based on Ripley's K function, at a global scale and for each season separately, to identify regions where precipitation extremes tend to cluster in time over timescales of a few days to a few weeks. We analyze several observational and reanalysis datasets, as well as output from CMIP6 Global Climate Models (GCMs). Good agreement is found on the spatio-temporal clustering patterns across datasets. Sub-seasonal temporal clustering is largely concentrated over the tropical oceans, where it can be detected year-round. It is also significant over certain tropical lands, like Eastern Africa, and seasonally outside the tropics in several regions, most notably around the eastern subtropical oceans (Iberian Peninsula and Western North America during the DJF and MAM seasons) Southwest Asia (especially during JJA and SON) and Australia (in SON). We also find that CMIP6 models generally correctly reproduce clustering patterns, paving the way for an assessment of trends in sub-seasonal clustering under climate change. Clustering of present-day extremes increases in many areas under climate change. Changes diagnosed by comparing present day and future extreme percentiles are positive and negative and strongest in the tropical areas.

This problem is particularly significant due to the climate change observed in recent decades, manifested, among others, in the increase in the precipitation intensities or changes in their structure. Taking into account these forecasts is essential to safely design sewer systems and their proper operation. The work aims to verify the Euler type II standard rainfall used so far to model sewage systems in Poland and to develop the forecasted form of this pattern in the perspective of 2050. Precipitation data from measurement stations in Wroclaw were used as research material. The prediction model of maximum rainfall amounts allowed to determine the forecasted increase in intensities of short-term rainfall (for the occurrence frequencies recommended by Standard EN 752:2017 for the dimensioning and modeling of sewage systems). On this basis, model hyetographs forecasted for 2050 were prepared for Wroclaw. Their choice-as a future rainfall load in hydrodynamic modeling-will allow one to meet the requirements for the frequency of flooding occurrence from sewer systems and their safe operation over several decades.

Impacts of Climate Change on Hydrological Regimes in the Congo River Basin	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Congo River Basin; hydrological regime; water resources; drought; SWAT model; representative concentration pathway	WATER-QUALITY MODEL; CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY	Surface water resources are essential for a wide range of human activities, such as municipal water supply, fishing, navigation, irrigation, and hydropower. Their regime is also linked to environmental sustainability, water-related risks, human health, and various ecosystem services. Global warming is expected to modify surface water availability, quality, and distribution and therefore affect water use productivity as well as the incidence of water-related risks. Thus, it is important for communities to plan and adapt to the potential impacts of climate change. The Congo River Basin, home to 75 million people, is subject to recurrent flood and drought events, which are expected to worsen as a result of climate change. This study aims to assess future modifications of the hydrological regime of the Congo River and the socio-economic impacts of these projected changes for three future periods: 2011-2041, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Congo River Basin was developed, calibrated, and validated using daily rainfall observations combined with daily time series of precipitation, temperatures, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed derived from the WFDEI (Watch Forced Era Interim) reanalysis data set. The outputs of ten Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-AFRICA) were statistically downscaled to obtain future climate time series, considering two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP8.5 and RCP4.5. The calibrated model was used to assess changes in streamflow in all reaches of the Congo River. Results suggest relative changes ranging from -31.8% to +9.2% under RCP4.5 and from -42.5% to +55.5% under RCP 8.5. Larger relative changes occur in the most upstream reaches of the network. Results also point to an overall decrease in discharge in the center and southern parts of the basin and increases in the northwestern and southeastern parts of the basin under both emission scenarios, with RCP8.5 leading to the most severe changes. River discharge is likely to decrease significantly, with potential consequences for agriculture, hydropower production, and water availability for human and ecological systems.

Shoreline Solutions: Guiding Efficient Data Selection for Coastal Risk Modeling and the Design of Adaptation Interventions	WATER			English	Article						coastal risk assessment; sea level rise and storm surge modeling; Caribbean	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; SENSITIVITY; IMPACT	The Caribbean is affected by climate change due to an increase in the variability, frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events. When coupled with sea level rise (SLR), poor urban development design, and loss of habitats, severe flooding often impacts the coastal zone. In order to protect citizens and adapt to a changing climate, national and local governments need to investigate their coastal vulnerability and climate change risks. To assess flood and inundation risk, some of the critical data are topography, bathymetry, and socio-economic. We review the datasets available for these parameters in Jamaica (and specifically Old Harbour Bay) and assess their pros and cons in terms of resolution and costs. We then examine how their use can affect the evaluation of the number of people and the value of infrastructure flooded in a typical sea level rise/flooding assessment. We find that there can be more than a three-fold difference in the estimate of people and property flooded under 3m SLR. We present an inventory of available environmental and economic datasets for modeling storm surge/SLR impacts and ecosystem-based coastal protection benefits at varying scales. We emphasize the importance of the careful selection of the appropriately scaled data for use in models that will inform climate adaptation planning, especially when considering sea level rise, in the coastal zone. Without a proper understanding of data needs and limitations, project developers and decision-makers overvalue investments in adaptation science which do not necessarily translate into effective adaptation implementation. Applying these datasets to estimate sea level rise and storm surge in an adaptation project in Jamaica, we found that less costly and lower resolution data and models provide up to three times lower coastal risk estimates than more expensive data and models, indicating that investments in better resolution digital elevation mapping (DEM) data are needed for targeted local-level decisions. However, we also identify that, with this general rule of thumb in mind, cost-effective, national data can be used by planners in the absence of high-resolution data to support adaptation action planning, possibly saving critical climate adaptation budgets for project implementation.

Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)	WATER			English	Review						Lake; reservoir; sustainability; management; ecosystem service; threat; opportunity; SDGs; interlinkages	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; EMERGING CONTAMINANTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER-RESOURCES; WASTE-WATER; FRESH-WATER; HYDROPOWER	Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.

Risk perception-A lens for understanding adaptive behaviour in the age of climate change? Narratives from the Global South	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Risk perception; Climate change; Waterlogging; Place attachment; Southwest Bangladesh	DISASTER RESILIENCE; CHANGE ADAPTATION; PLACE ATTACHMENT; COASTAL REGION; FLOOD; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; AREAS	Risk perception, a judgment of how risk is perceived individually and communicated scientifically, helps clarify local knowledge, know-how, and experience. However, community disaster preparedness and DRR planning have often overlooked community risk perception. This study investigates how risk perception at the community level influences and facilitates local DRR initiatives. It explores southwest Bangladesh as a case study, an area highly vulnerable to climatic impacts such as tropical storms, floods, and rising sea-level. This study analyses media and local narratives, in-depth interviews, and field observations. We find that community risk perception (a) tends to be ignored in local adaptation planning and (b) is shaped by four influential factors relating to local residents: their varied interests; socio-economic opportunities; attachment to place and community; and risk-tolerance capacity. The study advances theory in revealing a dynamic relationship among perception of risk, adaptive behaviour, and tolerance of risk. Practically, it helps local authorities in southwest Bangladesh and similar locales enhance DRR practices by considering community experiences and perceptions of risk. Though oft challenged by the contemporary socio-political dynamics of the Global South, transferring knowledge of risk perception to inform decision-making is critical to strategic planning in the face of disasters.

Scientifically defining extreme rainfall events and obtaining the design rainfall is of great significance to analyze the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation events. Existing definitions of extreme precipitation events have usually focused on rainfall amounts at fixed durations rather than complete events with variable durations. Using sub-daily precipitation and runoff data covering 1971-2018 from 17 stations over the Jingle sub-basin, we constructed an appropriate copula function to define extreme persistent rainfall events under bivariate analysis and obtained the rainfall process of the designed rainfall under different return periods. The results showed that (1) the joint distribution based on Copula was more accurate than the traditional univariate probability methods for identifying extreme rainfall events with a threshold of 90%. (2) The Copula joint distribution established in the basin can well calculate the designed extreme rainfall under the return periods of 100 a, 50 a, 30 a, 25 a, 10 a and 5 a. (3) The rainfall intensity duration model had a good simulation effect on the rainfall intensity duration distribution of the basin.

A novel multi-objective optimization framework for urban green-gray infrastructure implementation under impacts of climate change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban flooding; Sponge city; SWMM; LID	WATER-QUALITY; FLOOD PEAKS; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; STORAGE; RISK	Frequent urban flooding disasters can cause severe economic and property losses. Accordingly, the construction of sponge city has become critical to alleviating urban flooding. However, the functional and structural integration of Green Infrastructure (GI) and Gray Drainage Facility (GDF) is still a matter of concern. This study proposed a novel implementation framework for GI and GDF synchronization optimization (G-GSOIF) based on the SWMM and SUSTAIN models, and used data from Beilin District in Xi'an, China to verify the effects. The results show that the spatiotemporal integrated optimization design of GI and GDF proves to be effective in stormwater management. The total investment was reduced by 16.7% and economic benefit was increased by 15.4% based on disaster risk control, and the utilization rate of rainwater resources exceeded 40%. The Staged optimization model (SSOM) based on the SUSTAIN model established in the G-GSOIF was demonstrated to effectively cope with the impact of future climate change by adjusting and optimizing the design scheme dynamically in different simulation scenarios. Integrated LID (I-LID) measures are conducive for simulation of large catchment areas, and have the same implementation effect as distributed LID measures. The results of this study could support decision-making for urban stormwater management and sponge city construction.	[Gao, Z.; Zhang, Q. H.; Xie, Y. D.; Wang, X.

Without robust and effective adaptation, numerous coastal zones will be drastically affected. There is an ongoing need for coastal adaptation particularly, for the low-lying deltas, which are highly vulnerable to the coastal hazards-based Sea Level Rise (SLR). Worldwide, the national coastal strategies mainly focusing on the three coastal adaptation approaches issued by the International Panel of Climate Change (retreat, accommodation, and protection). The developed and developing countries are being made serious efforts to adapt to the SLR. This paper investigates the Egyptian efforts, best practices, and experiences in dealing with coastal erosion, flooding, and inundation-based SLR. The Egyptian national strategy for coastal adaptation mainly adopted the protection approach. Along the Nile Delta coast of Egypt, various national projects contain coastal adaptation measures were detected, such as seawalls, revetments, sand dunes, nourishment, and artificial sand dunes based on a geotextile sand-tube core using natural reed mats for sand trapping. In addition, different actions such as constructing modern fish farming, regular dredging for coastal lakes and lagoons, and enforcing the coastal road were observed. All provide defense systems. Most of these promising adaptation technologies, efforts, and actions show favorable responses to guarantee adequate protection against SLR hazards.

J	Kasmalkar, I; Suckale, J				Kasmalkar, Indraneel; Suckale, Jenny			Traffic accidents and delays present contrasting pictures of traffic resilience to coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area, USA	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Coastal flooding; Transportation; Resilience; Traffic accidents; Sea level rise	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; TRANSPORTATION; VULNERABILITY; NETWORKS; CLUSTERS; WEATHER; RISK	Climate change is intensifying coastal floods and increasing the risks of traffic disruption in lowlying, coastal communities. Efforts to understand the differential impacts of traffic disruption on communities have led to the concept of traffic resilience which captures the degree to which a traffic system can recover from disruption. Existing proxies of traffic resilience are focused on quantifying travel time delays but lack the important dimension of road safety. In this study, we quantify traffic resilience in terms of the change in non-highway car and pedestrian accident rates during the 5-10 am period as a result of coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area for the 2020-2040 period. We use a regional traffic model to simulate traffic patterns under a range of coastal flood water levels. We use regressions that relate traffic volumes to historical accident rates to estimate accidents rates in the presence of flooding. Our results show that the flooding of highways forces commuters onto local roads passing through residential communities, causing a spike in accident rates. Unlike delays which increase sharply at the higher water levels considered in this study, we project that region-wide peak-hour accident rates may increase substantially at lower water levels.

A study of the indigenous landscape is critical to understanding the interaction between human activities and natural processes, thereby enhancing the delta's ability to cope with climate change and to control floods. This paper uses a case study of Can Tho City (CTC) to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of the local landscape system and explores how indigenous knowledge contributes to the sustainability of this landscape. The outcomes show (1) the complexity of balancing territorial organization and agriculture needs and (2) the combination between these two factors and local knowledge of flood resilience making it possible to preserve a landscape system concerning complex hydrological dynamics, in the downstream section of the Mekong River Basin. This paper argues that knowledge of indigenous agriculture cultivation and the functioning of local landscape system should be respected and used in the process of urban design to maintain sustainability over time. A scenario is discussed to emphasize the balance needed between a human-made environment and natural hydrodynamics to preserve the local landscape system and thereby enhance urban resilience to floods and climate change.

The macroeconomic impacts of future river flooding in Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; economic impacts; river flooding; disaster risk	NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; SUPPLY CHAINS; INPUT-OUTPUT; RISK; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; JAPAN	The economic impacts of disasters can reach far beyond the affected regions through interconnected transboundary trade flows. As quantification of these indirect impacts is complex, most disaster risk models focus on the direct impacts on assets and people in the impacted region. This study explicitly includes the indirect effects via regional economic interdependencies to model economic disaster losses on a continental scale, exemplified by river flooding in Europe. The results demonstrate that economic implications go beyond the direct damages typically considered. Moreover, we find that indirect losses can be offset by up to 60% by economic actors through finding alternative suppliers and markets within their existing trade relations. Towards the future, increases in economic flood losses (up to 350%) can be expected for all global warming scenarios. Indirect losses rise by 65% more compared to direct asset damages due to the increasing size of future flood events, making it more difficult to offset losses through alternative suppliers and markets. On a sectoral level, future increases in losses are highest for commercial services (similar to 980%) and public utilities (similar to 580%). As the latter are predominately affected through cascading effects, this highlights how interdependencies between economic actors could amplify future disaster losses.	[Koks, E.

J	Shinn, JE; Hall-Reinhard, A				Shinn, Jamie E.; Hall-Reinhard, Arianna			Emphasizing livelihoods in the study of social-ecological systems: insights from fishing practices in the Okavango Delta, Botswana	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Livelihoods; natural resource access; social-ecological systems; environmental governance; Okavango Delta; Botswana	TOURISM DEVELOPMENT; RURAL LIVELIHOODS; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; VULNERABILITY; TRANSITIONS; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE	Climate change will impact rural livelihoods in Southern Africa in unprecedented ways. Successful responses must account for intersecting social and ecological factors that determine natural resource access for people living in changing social-ecological systems. However, much of the existing scholarly literature treats natural resource access as a dynamic social process, while often failing to account for how it is also ecologically variable. The social-ecological systems literature more holistically considers social and ecological aspects of resource use, but rarely considers how livelihoods themselves are social-ecological. This paper advances the argument that livelihoods are a useful entry point for understanding the complex and intersecting social-ecological factors that impact natural resource use. Findings are presented from a mixed-methods research project in the variable wetland environment of the Okavango Delta of Botswana to show how participation in various fishing practices is determined by a complex combination of flooding variability, environmental governance, and social relations tied to gender and ethnicity. This article contributes to the literatures on natural resource access and social-ecological systems, increases knowledge about rural livelihoods in Botswana, and provides broader insight into how governance of social-ecological livelihood systems throughout southern Africa are likely to be challenged by climate change.

This study explores the link between the recession of Trakarding glacier and the growth of its proglacial Tsho Rolpa lake based on multi-temporal satellite images including high-resolution Corona KHA, KH-9 Hexagon and moderate-resolution Landsat images. The study reveals that Trakarding glacier shrank from 30.7 +/- 0.2 km(2) to 28.8 +/- 0.7 km(2) with an average rate of 0.04 +/- 0.001 km(2) a(-1) between 1964 and 2018. The glacier length reduced by about similar to 2 km with an annual rate of 37.0 m a(-1) +/- 0.2 m. The Tsho Rolpa proglacial lake grew nearly three times from 0.48 +/- 0.01 km(2) in 1964 to 1.56 +/- 0.01 km(2) in 2018 and has become one of the largest glacial lakes of Nepal. We conclude that the connection of proglacial lakes with glaciers snout accelerates the glacier recession, which in turn leads to the growth of lake itself.

This paper studies the shifting in flood timing at 6167 gauging stations from 1970 to 2010, globally. The shift in flood timing and its relationship with three influential factors (maximum 7-day precipitation, soil moisture excess, and snowmelt) are investigated. There is a clear global pattern in the mean flooding date: winter (Dec-Feb) across the western Coastal America, western Europe and the Mediterranean region, summer (Jun-Aug) in the north America, the Alps, Indian Peninsula, central Asia, Japan, and austral summer (Dec-Feb) in south Africa and north Australia area. The shift in flood timing has a trend from - 22 days per decade (earlier) to 28 days per decade (delayed). Earlier floods were found extensively in the north America, Europe and northeast Australia while delayed floods were prevailing in the Amazon, Cerrado, south Africa, India and Japan. Earlier flood timing in the north America and Europe was caused by earlier snowmelt while delayed extreme soil moisture excess and precipitation have jointly led to delayed floods around the monsoon zone, including south Africa, India and Japan. This study provides an insight on the shifting mechanism of flood timing, and supports decisions on the global flood mitigation and the impact from future climate change.

From this devastating event, we realized the lack of extreme precipitation and flood inundation information, which is a common problem in tropical regions. Therefore, we developed a Rapid Extreme TRopicAl preCipitation and flood inundation mapping framEwork (RETRACE) by utilizing: (1) a cloud computing platform, the Google Earth Engine (GEE); (2) open-source satellite images from missions such as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical satellites; and (3) flood victim information. The framework was demonstrated with the 2021-2022 Malaysia flood. The preliminary results were satisfactory with an optimal threshold of five for flood inundation mapping using the Sentinel-1 SAR data, as the accuracy of inundated floods was up to 70%. Extreme daily precipitation of up to 230 mm/day was observed and resulted in an inundated area of 77.43 km(2) in Peninsular Malaysia. This framework can act as a useful tool for local authorities and scientists to retrace the extreme precipitation and flood information in a relatively short period for flood management and mitigation strategy development.

GIS-based approach for evaluating a community intrinsic resilience index	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Resilience; Vulnerability; Natural hazards; Climate change; Risk management; GIS	TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DISASTER RESILIENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; VULNERABILITY; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS; LESSONS; KATRINA	Community resilience refers to the degree to which a community can survive and recover following a disaster. While resilience itself is well understood, decisions that would enhance resilience are interdependent and involve various stakeholders. There are indices for evaluating community resilience, but these have the shortcoming that they compare between political entities, such as counties. Therefore, one cannot ascertain that a county is truly resilient. In addition, natural disasters depend on the landscape and thus have no relation to the political boundaries. Our metric aims to capture the information into a Community Intrinsic Resilience Index (CIRI), which embodies the resilience level of four critical sectors: transportation, energy, health and socio-economic. As a case study, we computed CIRI for the counties within New Jersey. Results showed that within NJ, CIRI ranged from 63 to 80%. A post-disaster CIRI, following a scenario of flooding, revealed that two coastal counties would have low CIRI values due to the reduction in the road area and/or the GDP (local economy shut down) to below minimum values. We believe that our platform would further advance the efforts to fill the gap between resilience research and applications and would help decision and policy makers to integrate resilience within the planning and design phases of disaster management.

These climate change-induced and anthropogenic stressors on water resources represent the leading water-related hazards to communities. Further, the increasing exposure of the population and infrastructure to such events has heightened the risks. Assessing the impact scope of these events in different subfields towards comprehensively evaluating the risks requires an unbiased systematic approach. This paper combines content analysis and science mapping to investigate the existing multidisciplinary body of knowledge on analyzing flood and drought together. Searching the literature using selected search terms yielded a sample of 119 publications. Initially, various contents, such as the authors' keywords, applied methods and indices, and study scale, were extracted from these articles. These contents were then incorporated into the science mapping technique to form communicative networks. Analyzing these publications revealed 13 major research themes, with a sustained focus on hydrological issues. However, a more diverse range of themes was recently revealed, including economy, sociology, insurance, and policymaking. Producing such computational and visual networks explained informative insights that can help further develop both existing and new frameworks to support the management, design and policymaking sectors in responding to both flood and drought events.

J	Kuang, D; Liao, KH				Kuang, Da; Liao, Kuei-Hsien			Learning from Floods: Linking flood experience and flood resilience	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Flood experience; Learning; Learning-based flood mitigation; Learning from floods; Flood resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; EXPLORING GOVERNANCE; URBAN DESIGN; KNOWLEDGE; PERCEPTION; LESSONS; VULNERABILITY	It has been argued that learning from flood experience contributes to flood resilience. However, it is unclear what such a learning process involves, and it is debatable whether flood experience always leads to flood resilience. To bridge this research gap, we develop the Learning from Floods (LFF) model to articulate the process of learning from flood experience and how it affects flood resilience. The LFF model suggests that flood experience prompts individual and social learning to give rise to flood-related knowledge, which is subject to learning opportunity, learning motivation, and prior knowledge. Flood-related knowledge could inform flood management and/or other action, which however can be limited by barriers, including information and resource availability, attitude, social capital, and policy barriers. Together, flood-related knowledge and its resulting action are considered the lesson learned, which then affects flood resilience through changing floodability, recoverability, adaptability, and/or transformability. We apply the LFF model to discuss the different learning processes and their respective effects on flood resilience in two environments. It suggests that an environment that is well-protected by flood control infrastructure is not conducive to learning about flood mitigation. Subsequently, we call for learning-based flood mitigation to nurture flood resilience in the face of climate change.

In this study, we used 50 years of precipitation and streamflow data across Iran to analyse the spatial distribution, slope, and significance of long-term trends in extreme precipitation compared to the spatial distribution of long-term trends for flood magnitude and frequency. Despite the decreasing trend of extreme precipitation in 60% of Iran's sub-basins, the flood magnitude showed an increasing trend. In particular, the number of flooding days with a return period of 25 similar to 50 years and >50 years in 2010s has increased by 1.3 and 2.2 times, respectively, compared to that in 2000s. We attributed the above contrasting relationship between extreme precipitation and flood magnitude to the influence of an increase in short-duration extreme precipitations, extensive land use and land cover change, and reduced soil infiltration due to long-term droughts.

However, the extent to which these torrential rains are connected to other regions outside the Mediterranean remains uncertain. Here we simulate 160 extreme precipitation events with an atmospheric model enabled for state-of-the-art moisture tracking and demonstrate that large scale moisture transport is a more important factor than evaporation over local sources. We find that the average precipitation fraction with source in the Mediterranean is only 35%, while 10% is from evapotranspiration over nearby land in continental Europe and 25% originates in the North Atlantic. The remaining 30% comes from several more distant source regions, sometimes as remote as the tropical Pacific or the Southern Hemisphere, indicating direct connections with multiple locations on the planet and a global scale energy redistribution. Our results point to the importance of approaching these extreme episodes from a more global rather than purely regional perspective, especially when attempting to attribute them to climate change.

Dynamic rule curves for multipurpose reservoir operation for different floods	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; flood control; flood prediction; reservoir operation; retention; rule curves	SYSTEMS	Dynamic flood control rule curves (DFCRCs) that balance the use of conservation space between flood control and conservation purposes are usually necessary for the operation of a multipurpose reservoir. This paper therefore proposes a procedure to apply the DFCRCs of an historically-based actual flood for reservoir operation versus different floods whose hydrograph shapes vary widely. The proposal uses related-size characteristics (e.g. net retention of the DFCRCs and peak discharge of associated outflows) in a stepwise manner from those of the smallest return period to those of the largest one. Illustrative applications of the procedure to the operation of the multipurpose Ubol Ratana Dam (The Nam Pong Basin, Thailand) have indicated that it enables the DFCRCs to ensure the reservoir's operation against various floods. Its operational results for the large and moderate floods in 1990 and 1995 are comparable to those of historically based floods. In addition, impact assessment of climate change on the operational performance has shown that the system could not protect the areas upstream and downstream of the dam from the HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2 floods at the 80th and 95th percentile levels during the future 2050s period.

The present study aims at shedding light on the multifaceted links between floods, landscape modifications, and population dynamics in anthropogenic coastal lowlands, using a large flood-prone area (the Polesine Region, northeastern Italy) as a significant case study. Based on the analysis of historical events and the results of hydraulic modeling, it is shown that human interventions on both the landscape and the subsoil have substantially altered the flood dynamics, exacerbating hydraulic hazard. Furthermore, the combined analysis of people and assets exposure to inundation reveals that flood risk is not properly taken into account in land-use planning, nor it is properly understood by people living in areas subject to low-probability, high-impact flood events.

However, studies that provide the integration of flood-drought hazard events is scarce. This study assessed the flood and drought hazards for future climate in the Mun River basin. A non-modelling approach is used to assess the flood hazard, while a multi-variate approach is used for the drought hazard. The results suggest that areas under 'high' and 'very high' drought hazard levels will increase from 27 and 4% during the baseline period to 43 and 37%, during the near-future period. Similarly, an increase in the 'high' and 'very high' flood hazard levels from 11 and 22% during the baseline period to 16 and 24% during the near-future period is projected. When both hazards are considered together, the total hazard is projected to increase by 155% in the near-future period. 76% of the catchment during the near-future period will have a combined hazard level from 'medium' to 'very high' compared to the 30% during the baseline period. The research presents a grim outlook on future floods and droughts in the basin, with the areas of Nakhon Ratchasima, Rio Et and Si Sa Ket provinces particularly at risk from both hydro-meteorological hazards.

To achieve this objective, we utilize a county-level panel data set with information on cover crop adoption acres, crop insurance losses (i.e., specifically due to drought, excess heat, or excess moisture), and a number of weather variables. The data cover the main row crop production region in the Midwestern United States (US) for the period 2005 to 2018. We utilize linear fixed effects econometric models and a number of robustness checks in the empirical analysis (i.e., a fractional regression approach, two "external-instrument-free" estimation procedures, and a variety of alternative empirical specifications). The estimation methods used take advantage of the panel nature of the data to address various specification and endogeneity issues. We find evidence that counties with higher cover crop adoption tend to have lower crop insurance losses due to drought, excess heat, or excess moisture. Our analysis also indicates that cover crops likely have stronger loss mitigation effects against excess moisture events (like floods) and somewhat weaker loss mitigation impacts against droughts and excess heat. Nonetheless, our results overall suggest that cover crops can enhance resilience to extreme weather events and have the potential to be an effective climate change adaptation strategy in US agriculture.

Due to parametrization and numerous simplifications, however, climate-model outputs come with systematic biases compared to the observations. In the past decade, several methods of different complexity and dimensionality for adjustment of such biases were introduced, but their benefits for impact studies and accurate streamflow pro-jections are still debated. In this paper, we evaluated the ability of two state-of-the-art, advanced multivariate bias-adjustment methods to accurately reproduce 16 hydrological signatures, and compared their performance against two parsimonious univariate bias-adjustment methods based on a multi-criteria performance evaluation. The results indicated that all bias-adjustment methods considerably reduced biases and increased the consistency of simulated hydrological signatures. The added value of multivariate methods in maintaining dependence structures between precipitation and temperature was not systematically reflected in the resulting hydrological signatures, as they were generally outperformed by univariate methods. The benefits of multivariate methods only emerged for low-flow signatures in snowmelt-driven catchments. Based on these findings, we identified the most suitable bias-adjustment methods for water-resources management in Nordic regions under a changing climate, and provided practical guidelines for the selection of bias-adjustment methods given specific research targets and hydroclimatic regimes.

Changes in the hydro-climatic regime of the Hunza Basin in the Upper Indus under CMIP6 climate change projections	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FUTURE HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; PRECIPITATION DISTRIBUTION; KARAKORAM-HIMALAYA; GLACIER MELT; RIVER-BASIN; WATER; RUNOFF; SNOW; ASIA	The Upper Indus Basin (UIB) heavily depends on its frozen water resources, and an accelerated melt due to the projected climate change may significantly alter future water availability. The future hydro-climatic regime and water availability of the Hunza basin (a sub-basin of UIB) were analysed using the newly released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate projections. A data and parameter parsimonious precipitation-runoff model, the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) model, was used with energy balance-based subroutines for snowmelt, glacier melt and evapotranspiration. The DDD model was set up for baseline (1991-2010), mid-century (2041-2060) and end-century (2081-2100) climates projections from two global circulation models (GCM), namely EC-Earth3 and MPI-ESM. The projections indicate a substantial increase in temperature (1.1-8.6 degrees C) and precipitation (12-32%) throughout the twenty-first century. The simulations show the future flow increase between 23-126% and the future glacier melt increase between 30-265%, depending on the scenarios and GCMs used. Moreover, the simulations suggest an increasing glacier melt contribution from all elevations with a significant increase from the higher elevations. The findings provide a basis for planning and modifying reservoir operation strategies with respect to hydropower generation, irrigation withdrawals, flood control, and drought management.

Among the environmental benefits offered by these measures, enhanced biodiversity, increased carbon storage, reduction of extreme temperatures, and pluvial flood control are crucial. The purpose of this study was to establish an integrated methodology for quantifying the benefits of NBSs and complementary measures and to apply it in a neighbourhood of Donostia-San Sebasti ' an (Spain), where two alternative designs that incorporated NBSs and complementary measures were designed. Then, the individual effectiveness of the four variables was measured using both in-situ measurements and modelling approaches. For the integrated effectiveness, a multicriteria decision analysis was employed. Both the 'feasible' design and the 'ideal' one led to an increase in biodiversity (46 and 108 %, respectively) and carbon storage (50 and 130 %, respectively). When considering each measure independently, putting soil provided the highest benefits for carbon capture and biodiversity; meanwhile, planting woody species and installing light-coloured permeable pavements and water fountains reduced the mean radiant temperature by 26.5 K and the air temperature by 0.5 and 2.5 K, respectively, in specific places. Finally, the importance of quantifying the multiple environmental benefits of NBSs for the selection of climate-smart options in urban planning has been highlighted.

Exploring the partial use of the Mo.SE system as effective adaptation to rising flood frequency of Venice	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LAGOON-OF-VENICE; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM-SURGE; WIND-WAVES; LESSONS; BASINS; PROTECTION; IMPACTS; BENEFIT	The Venice lagoon (Italy) is particularly vulnerable to the impact of subsidence and sea level rise driven by climate change. Some structural measures have been adopted over time to protect Venice from flooding, among which a system of flap gates (Experimental Electromechanical Module, Mo.S.E., system) has been operational in the testing phase since October 2020. However, relative sea level rise and wind set-up pose relevant management challenges, as a frequent closing of the lagoon would have negative impacts on flushing capacity, the fishing industry, and port activities. Here, the focus is on the hydrodynamic effects of a partial closure of the Mo.S.E. barriers that, compared to closing all the three inlets of the lagoon, could play a role in reducing the economic and environmental impacts of the Mo.S.E. system. The main goal is to identify the flooding events that can be counteracted by closing only the Lido inlet, which is the closest to the city of Venice. Based on the tidal and meteorological dataset collected in the period 2000-2019, a robust modelling exercise identifies a linear relationship between tidal range and reduction of the sea level peaks, which results in the protection of all urban settlements within the lagoon from two-thirds of the flooding events up to a relative sea level rise of +0.4 m.

Response of extreme precipitation to uniform surface warming in quasi-global aquaplanet simulations at high resolution	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						extreme rainfall; climate change; convective organization	ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL-CIRCULATION; TROPICAL PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; CONVECTION; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY; DYNAMICS; POWER	Projections of precipitation extremes in simulations with global climate models are very uncertain in the tropics, in part because of the use of parameterizations of deep convection and model deficiencies in simulating convective organization. Here, we analyse precipitation extremes in high-resolution simulations that are run without a convective parameterization on a quasi-global aquaplanet. The frequency distributions of precipitation rates and precipitation cluster sizes in the tropics of a control simulation are similar to the observed distributions. In response to climate warming, 3 h precipitation extremes increase at rates of up to 9% K-1 in the tropics because of a combination of positive thermodynamic and dynamic contributions. The dynamic contribution at different latitudes is connected to the vertical structure of warming using a moist static stability. When the precipitation rates are first averaged to a daily timescale and coarse-grained to a typical global climate-model resolution prior to calculating the precipitation extremes, the response of the precipitation extremes to warming becomes more similar to what was found previously in coarse-resolution aquaplanet studies. However, the simulations studied here do not exhibit the high rates of increase of tropical precipitation extremes found in projections with some global climate models. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.	[O'Gorman, P.

Coastal habitats are particularly vulnerable to the effects of near-term sea-level rise. In California, Pacific harbour seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) are a natural indicator species of coastal change because of their reliance on terrestrial habitats, abundance, distribution, and site fidelity. Pacific harbour seals are marine top predators that are easily observed while hauled out at terrestrial sites, which are essential for resting, pupping, and moulting. Although increasing inundation from recent sea-level rise and storm-driven flooding has changed the Californian coastline, little is known about the effect of future sea-level rise and increased storm frequency and strength on harbour seal haulout site availability and quality in California. Harbour seal habitat was modelled at two sandbar-built estuaries under a series of likely sea-level rise and storm scenarios. The model outputs suggest that, over time, habitat at both estuaries decreased with increasing sea level, and storm-enhanced water levels contributed significantly to habitat flooding. These changes reflect pressures on coastal habitats that have an impact on human and natural systems.

While many approaches have been used to measure social vulnerability to natural hazards, there is no single method or universally agreed approach. This paper proposes a novel approach to developing social vulnerability indicators, using the example of flooding in Aotearoa New Zealand. A conceptual framework was developed to guide selection of the social vulnerability indicators, based on previous frameworks (including the MOVE framework), consideration of climate change, and a holistic view of health and wellbeing. Using this framework, ten dimensions relating to social vulnerability were identified: exposure; children; older adults; health and disability status; money to cope with crises/losses; social connectedness; knowledge, skills and awareness of natural hazards; safe, secure and healthy housing; food and water to cope with shortage; and decision making and participation. For each dimension, key indicators were identified and implemented, mostly using national Census population data. After development, the indicators were assessed by end users using a case study of Porirua City, New Zealand, then implemented for the whole of New Zealand. These indicators will provide useful data about social vulnerability to floods in New Zealand, and these methods could potentially be adapted for other jurisdictions and other natural hazards, including those relating to climate change.

CLIMATE TRANSITION RELIEF: FEDERAL BUYOUTS FOR UNDERWATER HOMES	DUKE LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; MANAGED RETREAT; LEGAL CHANGE; PROPERTY; RETROACTIVITY; VULNERABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; POPULATION; EXPERIENCE; RELOCATION	As climate change causes unprecedented dislocation from flooding and sea-level rise, a new legal regime for climate retreat (i.e., shifting human settlement from severe climate risk zones) is developing. Buyout laws, acquisitions of severely flood-impacted homes, enabling owners to relocate, and require localities to rezone acquired land as open space. Despite the growing interest in flood buyouts as a tool for climate change adaptation, there has been little attention by policymakers or scholars to the capacity of buyouts to incentivize "buy ins " to flood buyouts' increasing role in climate retreat. This Article reconceptualizes buyouts from their current focus on dispossession to a form of climate transition relief that balances incentive effects against individual losses. Specifically, this Article advocates for a presumption against buyouts for flooded homeowners in order to curb incentives for high-risk housing choices. This reform would carve out a significant exception for low-income residents of floodplains and means test buyouts. In the face of severely constrained housing choice, unaffordable flood insurance, and high marginal costs from property loss, this group is less vulnerable to incentive distortion from compensation and more vulnerable to harm from dislocation. While this Article focuses on flood buyouts, the model of climate transition relief I propose can inform climate compensation and retreat policymaking more broadly.

The study assessed the flood risk of areas in the city of Gweru and the damage from the 2020/21 rainfall season flooding. A mixed methods research design anchored by both qualitative and quantitative data probing techniques was employed in this study. Geographic information system, questionnaire, interviews and observations were adopted for data collection. Microsoft excel 2013 and ArcMap 10.5 software were used for data analysis. The majority of residential areas are located in flood-prone areas. Disregard of city by-laws, corruption and poor planning were major drivers of establishment of residential stands in flood-risk areas. Property damage and crop destruction among others were major socioeconomic impacts of the 2020/21 rainfall season flooding incident. The study concludes that areas historically reserved as urban carbon-sinks prior to the current climate change geographical period have now been developed into residential areas because of the lull in flooding events in recent years. The study recommends that urban development authorities should cognize frequent auditing of development activities and due-respect of urban by-laws in order to avoid development in flood-risk areas.

J	Swarnkar, S; Mujumdar, P; Sinha, R				Swarnkar, Somil; Mujumdar, Pradeep; Sinha, Rajiv			Modified hydrologic regime of upper Ganga basin induced by natural and anthropogenic stressors	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-EROSION; LAND-USE; SEDIMENT DYNAMICS; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; WATER-RESOURCES; RIVER; INDIA; EVENTS; PRECIPITATION	Climate change and anthropogenic activities pose serious threats to river basin hydrology worldwide. The Ganga basin is home to around half a billion people and has been significantly impacted by hydrological alterations in the last few decades. The increasing high-intensity rainfall events often create flash flooding events. Such events are frequently reported in mountainous and alluvial plains of the Ganga basin, putting the entire basin under severe flood risk. Further, increasing human interventions through hydraulic structures in the upstream reaches significantly alter the flows during the pre-and post-monsoon periods. Here, we explore the hydrological implications of increasing reservoir-induced and climate-related stressors in the Upper Ganga Basin (UGB), India. Flow/sediment duration curves and flood frequency analysis have been used to assess pre-and post-1995 hydrological behaviour. Our results indicate that low and moderate flows have been significantly altered, and the flood peaks have been attenuated by the operation of hydraulic structures in the Bhagirathi (western subbasin). The Alaknanda (eastern subbasin) has experienced an increase in extreme rainfall and flows post-1995. The downstream reaches experience reservoir-induced moderate flow alterations during pre-and post-monsoon and increasing extreme flood magnitudes during monsoon. Furthermore, substantial siltation upstream of the reservoirs has disrupted the upstream-downstream geomorphologic linkages.

J	Membele, GM; Naidu, M; Mutanga, O				Membele, Garikai Martin; Naidu, Maheshvari; Mutanga, Onisimo			Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Geographical Information System in mapping flood vulnerability in informal settlements in a South African context: a critical review	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Review						Indigenous knowledge; geographical information system; integration; flood vulnerability; South Africa	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; GIS; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; DISASTERS; BASIN; WORK	Climate change and the multidimensional nature of flood vulnerability, necessitate an in-depth consideration of experiential knowledge in reducing flood vulnerability in geospatial environments such as informal settlements. The objective of this paper is to provide a critical review of literature and scholarship in the context of the integration of Indigenous Knowledge and Geographical Information System in mapping flood vulnerability in South Africa. Keywords were searched in two databases for empirical studies that integrated Indigenous Knowledge and Geographical Informal System in mapping flood vulnerability in South Africa. The search extended to literature cited in the papers identified from the databases. The studies were thematically analysed and synthesized. The findings reveal that flood vulnerability in South Africa is mainly considered from an integrated perspective. Approaches used to integrate Indigenous Knowledge and Geographical Information Systems in mapping flood vulnerability are fragmented. There is a lack of sensitivity analysis and map validation, limited use of Indigenous Knowledge as well as inadequate community participation in the mapping of flood vulnerability in informal settlements. This critical review demonstrates the need for a comprehensive, explicit and participatory approach for integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Geographical Information System that genuinely utilize the special characteristics that each of them possesses.

It facilitates political procrastination and brings us ever closer to a world beset by growing food insecurity, heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and extensive losses to biodiversity. Numerous studies have unmasked the private agendas and corporate links behind organized denial, yet the question of how deniers find traction with democratic publics has received comparatively little attention. Empirical surveys demonstrate a connection between people who are susceptible to the contrarian voices of denial and those inclined towards right-wing authoritarianism. In this essay, I bring Adorno's mid-20th-century studies of right-wing authoritarian tendencies in American democracy to bear upon climate science denial. Adorno directs us away from a sole focus on how deniers manufacture doubt so as to give the impression that the science is not settled. He examines the ways that agitators not only spread misinformation but also foster emotional connections with people who seem to want to be conned. I locate organized denial within a strain of cultural life that Adorno describes as unserious. In late 1940s America, Adorno discerned a new shape of political subjectivity, which has become highly resonant today: a formally free individual who takes pleasure in lies that sound like truth.

Using UAV to Capture and Record Torrent Bed and Banks, Flood Debris, and Riparian Areas	DRONES			English	Article						environmental status; fluvio-geomorphological events; granulometry; orthomosaics; stream; torrent; visual protocol	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EROSION; STREAM; RIVER; SEDIMENT; DEPOSITION; VEGETATION; RESOLUTION; DYNAMICS; RAINFALL	Capturing and recording fluvio-geomorphological events is essential since these events can be very sudden and hazardous. Climate change is expected to increase flash floods intensity and frequency in the Mediterranean region, thus enhancing such events will also impact the adjacent riparian vegetation. The aim of this study was to capture and record the fluvial-geomorphological changes of the torrent bed and banks and flood debris events with the use of UAV images along a reach of Kallifytos torrent in northern Greece. In addition, a novel approach to detecting changes and assessing the conditions of the riparian vegetation was conducted by using UAV images that were validated with field data based on a visual protocol. Three flights were conducted using the DJI Spark UAV. Based on the images collected from these flights, orthomosaics were developed. The orthomosaics clearly identified changes in the torrent bed and detected debris flow events after major flood events. In addition, the results on the assessment of riparian vegetation conditions were satisfactory. Utilizing UAV images shows great potential to capture, record, and monitor fluvio-geomorphological events and riparian vegetation. Their utilization would help water managers to develop more sustainable management solutions based on actual field data.

This poses significant challenges to safeguard coastal communities. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of economically efficient protection scenarios along Europe's coastlines during the present century. We employ a probabilistic framework that integrates dynamic simulations of all ESL components and flood inundation, impact modelling and a cost-benefit analysis of raising dykes. We find that at least 83% of flood damages in Europe could be avoided by elevating dykes in an economically efficient way along 23.7%-32.1% of Europe's coastline, specifically where high value conurbations exist. The European mean benefit to cost ratio of the investments varies from 8.3 to 14.9 while at country level this ranges between 1.6 and 34.3, with higher efficiencies for a scenario with high-end greenhouse gas emissions and strong socio-economic growth. There lacks a European cost-benefit analysis of possible protective measures against rising seas. Here the authors used a probabilistic data and modeling framework to estimate costs and benefits of coastal protection measures and found that at least 83% of flood damages could be avoided by dyke improvements along a third of the European coastline.

Resilience is widely accepted as a strategy for reducing the risks of vulnerability and maintaining sustainable development. This research conceptualized vulnerability to hazard and exposure, and resilience to adaptation to urban flooding and explores their associations from a spatial balance perspective. The hazard of urban flooding was evaluated by hydrographic models, whereas exposure and adaptation were examined by indexes. Shenzhen, a densely populated socialist Chinese city, was selected as the case city. Results revealed that districts in the marginalized areas of Shenzhen experience high vulnerability to urban flooding because of poor geographic factors, immature drainage systems of urban villages, and the influx of rural migrants with sensible populations driven by high housing prices in urban center. The situation is becoming increasingly serious because of strong spatial mismatch between vulnerability and resilience with urban overutilization and the rural underutilization of adaptation resource allocation. Social segregation on adaptation resource occurs for public service provision in a marketization situation instead of socialism. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms of the spatial imbalance between vulnerability and resilience in socialist city, such as Shenzhen is necessary for reducing such impacts in future research.

Metal Release under Anaerobic Conditions of Urban Soils of Four European Cities	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						Urban soils; Climate change; Potentially toxic elements; Redox; Flooding	POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS; HEAVY-METALS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; NEW-ORLEANS; IRON; BIOACCESSIBILITY; CONTAMINATION; MOBILITY; ZN; OXYHYDROXIDES	Urban soil contamination may represent an environmental threat in view of their proximity to humans. The ecological homogenization of urban areas has been postulated, and as the sources of pollution are the same in most European cities, it is possible that soil contamination is another factor of convergence. The current climate change with consequent increase of extreme rain events may affect the mobility of potentially toxic elements (PTE) thus increasing the risks. If the soil is submerged, Eh decreases and causes the solubilization of Fe and Mn oxides, which are important carriers of PTE. We compared the release of Cu, Pb, and Zn from 48 soils of four cities (namely Glasgow, Ljubljana, Sevilla, and Torino) when submerged for up to 30days. A decrease of the redox potential was observed in all soils after a few days and an increase of Mn and then Fe in solution. Cu, Pb, and Zn were consequently released to the solution according to the general soil contamination. Despite the marked differences in soil properties, the reaction to anaerobiosis appeared to be similar in all samples indicating that waterlogging of urban soil contaminated with PTE may pose a serious environmental risk and substantiating the hypothesis of ecological convergence.

Since the mid-twentieth century, rising temperatures have led to unsustainably high melting rates for many glaciers, particularly in the Himalaya, temporarily increasing summer meltwater run-off but continuously reducing the ice-storage volume. In this Review, we discuss how and why glaciers and meltwater supplies have changed, how they will likely evolve in the future and how these changes impact water resources and water-related hazards. Heterogeneous glacier retreat is changing streamflow patterns, in turn, affecting the incidence of glacial-lake outburst floods and exacerbating the risk of flooding and water shortages associated with future climate change. These changes could negatively impact downstream populations and infrastructure, including the thriving hydropower sector and some of the world's largest irrigated agriculture systems, by making water flow more extreme and unpredictable. An improved in situ monitoring network for weather, hydrology and glacier change is a crucial requirement for predicting the future of this resource and associated hazards, and their impact on regional water, energy and food security. Glaciers in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges provide freshwater and hydropower to millions of people but are also melting at unsustainably high rates. This Review discusses recent and projected changes in glacier melt and resulting implications for regional water-related hazards and water resources. Key pointsHimalayan glaciers have lost mass at an accelerating rate in recent decades, in contrast with relatively stable Karakoram glaciers.Under a range of climate change scenarios, the run-off of glacier meltwater in the Himalaya and Karakoram is likely to peak in the next few decades.After glacial run-off peaks, run-off will decline as the glaciers in both mountain ranges shrink, although the magnitude and timing of the peak and the rate of subsequent decline are uncertain.Basin run-off regimes will become more rain-dominated as the modulating effect of glaciers decreases, and this is likely to increase the impact of droughts and floods.The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods and run-off floods have increased recently and could increase further in coming decades, threatening existing and planned hydropower infrastructure downstream.A lower-emissions climate change pathway would reduce the rate of glacier loss, increasing the time available for adaptation. This pathway would have considerable socio-economic benefits.

J	de Oliveira, AD; Bonetti, J				de Oliveira, Allan de Oliveira; Bonetti, Jarbas			Dynamical descriptors of physical vulnerability to sea-level rise in sheltered coastal systems: A methodological framework	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change impacts on sheltered systems; Coastal risk to flooding; Water level assessment in lagoons; Numerical modeling of winds and tides; Mapping of coastline susceptibility	SANDY BEACHES; LAGOON; INDEX; SENSITIVITY; EXPOSURE; IMPACTS; HAZARDS; INDIA; RIA	Many studies about the susceptibility of coastal systems to flood hazard have been carried out using similar methodological approaches, based on the spatial integration of structural and dynamical variables. However, although the general framework fits well to most exposed coastal sectors, few examples can be found in the literature regarding the proposal of dynamical descriptors (variables of process) particularly relevant to the analysis of the physical vulnerability of sheltered coastal systems, such as lagoons. The aim of this study was to propose a methodology to assess the physical vulnerability to sea-level rise due to climate change which was tested in the Conceicao Lagoon, located in Santa Catarina (Brazil), based on dynamic descriptors obtained from numerical modeling. After implementing a numerical model calibrated to satisfactorily reproduce the hydrodynamic characteristics of the studied system, we simulated different sea-level rise scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), using optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100. Results were classified following the often-adopted scheme of very low to very high vulnerability. The maximum variations in the lagoon level calculated by the model showed the importance of winds and tides (both astronomical and meteorological) as the main triggering processes of level oscillation. The final physical vulnerability spatial distribution, obtained by the integration of maximum lagoon level variations associated with future projections, allowed the recognition of the sectors within the lagoon system which are more prone to suffering impacts. Most of the system was considered to have an intermediate vulnerability to sea-level rise. However, sectors with high vulnerability were also identified, mostly located at the northern and southern shores of the lagoon (due to wind influence), as well as along its inlet margins (due to ocean dynamics). The proposed framework based on the variations of the water level can be widely adopted as a descriptor that synthesizes the main dynamic processes responsible for the physical vulnerability of sheltered systems, fitting to lagoons and bays with different physiographic characteristics. The determination of the spatial distribution of areas with different degrees of susceptibility can be a valuable tool for coastal planning and management actions to be performed in sheltered systems, which has been overlooked comparing to those applied in open coasts.

It occurs when people gather in specific areas, disrupting natural and built environments. Despite its importance, the manner in which urbanization transforms land use patterns and overall land topography, contributing to the uncertainty of urban flooding, remains unclear. This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment of the impact of urbanization on urban flood risk based on the Urban Flood Risk Triangle Index (UFRTI) of Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, in 2000, 2010, and 2020. The study developed this assessment framework through spatial analysis using Bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association and K-means clustering analysis. The revised parameters for urban flood hazard, exposure, and vulnerability constitute the UFRTI, illustrating how urbanization influences the degree and characteristics of urban flood risk. This study highlights the potential of using BiLISA and K-means clustering in GIS-based spatial analysis that reveals flood risk characteristics are shifting towards the city's periphery, requiring land use regulations and efficient flood risk management to confront urban growth.

J	Do, C; Kuleshov, Y				Do, Cameron; Kuleshov, Yuriy			Multi-Hazard Tropical Cyclone Risk Assessment for Australia	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						tropical cyclones; risk assessment; Australia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS	Tropical cyclones (TCs) have long posed a significant threat to Australia's population, infrastructure, and environment. This threat may grow under climate change as projections indicate continuing rises in sea level and increases in rainfall during TC events. Previous Australian TC risk assessment efforts have focused on the risk from wind, whereas a holistic approach requires multi-hazard risk assessments that also consider impacts of other TC-related hazards. This study assessed and mapped TC risk nationwide, focusing on the impacts on population and infrastructure from the TC-related hazards of wind, storm surges, flooding, and landslides. Risk maps were created at the Local Government Area (LGA) level for all of Australia, using collated data on multiple hazards, exposure, and vulnerability. The results demonstrated that the risk posed by all hazards was highest for coastal LGAs of eastern Queensland and New South Wales, followed by medium risk across Northern Territory and north-western Western Australia. Further enhancement and validation of risk maps developed in this study will provide decision makers with the information needed to reduce TC risk, save lives, and prevent damage to infrastructure.

Understanding the Drivers of Coastal Flood Exposure and Risk From 1860 to 2100	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						sea-level rise; coastal flood exposure; coastal flood risk; attribution	SEA-LEVEL RISE; HURRICANE KATRINA; LAND RECLAMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ATTRIBUTION; ADAPTATION; PROTECTION; DATABASE; WEATHER; COSTS	Global coastal flood exposure (population and assets) has been growing since the beginning of the industrial age and is likely to continue to grow through 21st century. Three main drivers are responsible: (a) climate-related mean sea-level change, (b) vertical land movement contributing to relative sea-level rise, and (c) socio-economic development. This paper attributes growing coastal exposure and flood risk from 1860 to 2100 to these three drivers. For historic flood exposure (1860-2005) we find that the roughly six-fold increase in population exposure and 53-fold increase in asset exposure are almost completely explained by socio-economic development (>97% for population and >99% for assets). For future exposure (2005-2100), assuming a middle-of-the-road regionalized socio-economic scenario (SSP2) without coastal migration and sea-level rise according to RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, climate-change induced sea-level rise will become the most important driver for the growth in population exposure, while growth in asset exposure will still be mainly determined by socio-economic development.

Therefore, exploring what drives the millennial-scale variability is of significant importance for future prediction of extreme climates. Here we present a new East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall reconstruction from the northwest Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) spanning the past 650 kyr. The magnitude of millennial-scale variability (MMV) in EASM rainfall is linked to ice volume and greenhouse gas (GHG) at the 100 kyr eccentricity band and to GHG and summer insolation at the precession band. At the glacial-interglacial timescale, gradual changes in CO2 during intermediate glaciations lead to increased variability in North Atlantic stratification and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, propagating abrupt climate changes into East Asia via the westerlies. Within the 100 kyr cycle, precession variability further enhances the response, showing that stronger insolation and increased atmospheric GHG cause increases in the MMV of EASM rainfall. These findings indicate increased extreme precipitation events under future warming scenarios, consistent with model results.

Representative tubers of the treated plants were collected 91 days after planting. The samples were freeze-dried, and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. The fine powder of the tuber samples was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to identify their metabolomic profiles. The NMR data was analyzed using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis to identify any variations between the treatments. In both models, plants exposed to drought clearly separated from the plants that received either excess or moderate water (control). The potato tubers that experienced drought and flood treatments had the highest quantities of aspartic acid, asparagine, and isoleucine. Furthermore, the potatoes exposed to either drought or flood had higher levels of valine and leucine (which are essential for plant defense and resistance against plant pathogens). Potato plants can respond metabolically to varying soil moisture stress.

Increasing frequency of climate-induced natural disasters calls for an urgent need to identify innovative practices for sustainable and effective humanitarian preparedness and response to ensure SRHR of affected populations. One such innovation is the empowerment of midwives in disaster response program planning and implementation. This article describes how midwives deployed to rural primary health centers provided quality SRHR services, particularly for labor and birth assistance and initial management of perinatal emergencies and referral in the aftermath of the 2022 flooding in northern and northeastern Bangladesh. Supportive supervision from physicians, adequate health care logistics and supplies, and administrative support from local health authorities created an enabling environment for the midwives. Community engagement through volunteers helped build rapport with residents and allowed patients to navigate health services. Deploying midwives as a response to climate-induced natural disaster was successful in establishing quality SRHR services. Future recommendations include systematically deploying midwives in health centers closest to the communities in locations vulnerable to climate change as part of routine health service delivery. This innovative approach clearly demonstrated that utilization of midwives during and after natural disasters could build community and health system resilience to climate change.

J	Luo, X; Lin, T				Luo, Xiao; Lin, Ting			Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis Based on the Current Generation of Data and Protocols	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; ICE-SHEET; SPATIAL SENSITIVITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; STORM-SURGE; GREENLAND; DESIGN; EARTHQUAKES; PROJECTIONS; INSIGHTS	Sea level rise, as a result of climate change, is expected to drive coastal hazards that could bring significant damages to coastal regions in the future. However, high uncertainties remain in the projections of sea level rise from different climate scenarios and sea level rise prediction models. Quantification and integration of these uncertainties are essential to better inform coastal planning and decision making for climate adaptation, critical for infrastructure sustainability and resilience. This paper advances knowledge cross-cutting structural engineering and climate change in the face of multihazards via a novel framework termed the Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis (PSLRHA). This study uses the current generation of models and protocols from the climate science research community to better portray the future climate and project sea level rise. The aggregation process produces the probability of exceeding a specific sea level rise threshold at a certain location and facilitates the creation of the global sea level rise hazard map. The relative importance of each climate scenario and sea level rise contributing models are demonstrated via the deaggregation process. We identify the models that have most contribution to extreme sea level rise thresholds, with large fluctuations in the high thresholds among ice sheet models. Finally, we show the practical implementation of PSLRHA results via compound flooding analyses using Houston as an illustrative example.

This may affect the frequency and severity of floods in Jamaica and the Caribbean Small Island Developing States. We investigate how flood hazards may be affected by increases in global mean surface temperature of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels using a case study of a Jamaican watershed. Rainfall projections from the PRECIS regional climate model for the Caribbean are analysed. Six members from the Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions (AENWH, AEXSA, AEXSC, AEXSK, AEXSL and AEXSM) were used to create 100-year flood inundation maps for the Hope river for different global warming levels using hydrological and hydraulic models. Model runs projected peak discharges at 2.0, 2.5 and 1.5 degrees C warming that were higher than discharges in the historical record of events that damaged sections of the watershed. Projections from the hydraulic model show increased flow area, depth and extent for 1.5 followed by 2.0 and 2.5 degrees C rises in temperature. These results imply continued flood risk for the vulnerable areas of the watershed. This article is part of the theme issue 'Developing resilient energy systems'.

In the course of energy transformation planning, the issue of energy infrastructure adaptation to climate change has often been left out. This study aims to identify climate-related risks and countermeasures taken in solar power plants in Thailand using thematic analysis with self-administered observations and structured interviews in order to propose points of consideration during long-term energy planning to ensure climate adaptation capacity. The analysis pointed out that floods and storms were perceived as major climate events affecting solar power plants in Thailand, followed by lightning and fires. Several countermeasures were taken, including hard countermeasures that require extensive investment. Following policy recommendations were derived from the climate-proofing investment scenario study. Policy support in terms of enabling regulations or financial incentives is needed for implementation of climate-proofing countermeasures. Public and private sectors need to secure sufficient budget for fast recovery after severe climate incidents. Measures must be taken to facilitate selection of climate-resilient sites by improving conditions of power purchase agreement or assisting winning bidders in enhancing climate adaptability of their sites. These issues should be considered during Thailand's long-term energy planning.

Promoting a more resilient farming system with key climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adaptations can improve productivity, sustainability, and food security for Mayan milpa farming communities. Once a sustainable system, the milpa has become less reliable in the last half century due to hydroclimatic changes (i.e., droughts, flooding, hurricanes), forest loss, soil degradation, and other factors. Using interviews with both milpa farmers and Extension officers in southern Belize. This qualitative study finds several socio-ecological system linkages of environmental, economic, socio-cultural, and adaptive technology factors, which influence the capacity for increasing CSA practices. Agriculture Extension, a government service of Belize, can facilitate effective CSA adaptations, specifically, an increase in mulching, soil nutrient enrichment, and soil cover, while working as partners within Maya farming traditions. These CSA practices can facilitate more equitable increases in crop production, milpa farm system sustainability, and resilience to climate change. However, there are several institutional and operational barriers in Extension which challenge their efficacy. Recommendations are presented in this study to reduce Extension barriers and promote an increase in CSA practices to positively influence food and livelihood security for milpa communities in southern Belize.

After development of hydrological and hydraulic models, a number of factors that played important roles in the impact of this flooding and other extreme events including river structures (reservoirs, historical textile mill dams, and bridges) were investigated. These factors are currently omitted within risk assessments tools such as flood insurance rate maps. Some management strategies that should be considered for future flood risk mitigation were modeled and discussed. Furthermore, to better understand possible future risks in a warmer climate, another extreme flood event was simulated. The synthetic/hypothetical storm (Hurricane Rhody with two landfalls) was created based on the characteristics of the historical hurricanes that severely impacted this region in the past. It was shown that while the first landfall of this hurricane did not lead to significant flood risk, the second landfall could generate more rain and flooding equivalent to a 500-year event. Results and the methodology of this study can be used to better understand and assess future flood risk in similar watersheds.	[Kouhi, Soroush; Hashemi, M.

The generation of this polar cold airmass and its outflow to lower latitudes play an important role in the climate system in terms of mass and heat exchanges. However, long-term changes in the polar cold airmass, especially in summer, and the climatic effects on mid-high latitudes are still unclear. Using an isentropic approach, we quantitatively show that the polar cold airmass amount has decreased rapidly since the 1980s, with a decade lagging behind the global warming. The equatorward flux of the cold airmass has also weakened, trapping the cold airmass in its source region. These profound changes in the cold airmass coincide with a period characterized by rapid surface warming and increasingly frequent heat waves in recent three decades over the mid-high latitude continents. Owing to regional differences in the cold airmass reduction, Europe and North America have experienced a surface warming faster than the Northern Hemisphere mean. Furthermore, such a long-term trend in the polar cold airmass can be attributed to Arctic sea ice loss and internal decadal variability of sea surface temperature in high-latitude oceans. Our results highlight that the isentropic analysis of cold airmass may serve a good detection of the climate change at polar region and mid-high latitudes.

The exacerbating consequences of climate change in form of droughts and floods force remote households to tap various water sources. Hence, household-based processes must be versatile to cope with e.g. contaminated ground water and turbid surface waters. Purification at household level must be self-sustaining in order to enable independence from continuous supply of power and consumables. In this study, we design a process accordingly and we prove its technical feasibility on pilot scale. The two-step process utilizes gravity-driven ultrafiltration and activated carbon adsorption to purify water, whereas the process regeneration is accomplished by combining Temperature Enhanced Backwash and Temperature Swing Adsorption to clean the membrane and adsorber, respectively. We obtained stable operation over > 40 days with a sustained fiowrate of similar to 5 L h(-1) and consistent product quality (turbidity <= 0.2 NTU) for all relevant water matrices: synthetic ground water, river water and even secondary effluent. We achieved a high removal of the spiked model micropollutant amitrole, environmental endocrine disruptors and bulk dissolved organics of similar to 93%, > 65% and similar to 69%, respectively, at the optimal water recovery for river water of similar to 80%. In-situ regeneration promises long-term, self-sufficient operation without exhaustion. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Often, coping strategies (technological or institutional interventions), developed by planners, become counter-productive as they are not in cognizance with the end user community. This study presents a methodology to enable incorporation of community knowledge and expectations in planning by integrating participatory rural appraisal (PRA) with geographic information systems, leading to better informed coping strategies. As part of this, we create thematic maps which: (i) capture information on a spatial scale (otherwise lost during PRA), (ii) facilitate community participation for further research and planning in their contexts, and, (iii) co-create knowledge to develop a shared understanding of water-related hazards at the village level. The proposed methodology is presented through three case study sites - two in the plains (<500 masl) and one in the middle (500-1,500 masl) elevation regions of Upper Ganga basin. We show how this way of approaching context analysis facilitates community involvement as well as co-creating a knowledge base which can help researchers and government officials with mindful planning of interventions in the area.

The current flood adaptation approach is failing to take advantage of the benefits provided by intact ecosystems and perpetuates social and economic inequities, leaving those who are most vulnerable at highest risk. Rooted in the experiences of the United States, we propose a new framework, the Flood Adaptation Hierarchy, which prioritizes outcomes into six tiers. Overall, the tiers distinguish between nature and nature-based solutions, with preference given to natural ecosystems. The most important outcome in our hierarchy is to avoid risk by protecting and restoring natural floodplains; next, eliminate risk by moving communities away from danger; and then to accommodate water with passive measures and active risk reduction measures. We include, but deprioritize, a defense of community assets using nature-based engineering and hardened engineering. Throughout the hierarchy, we provide guidance on the equity considerations of flood adaptation decision making and highlight "impacts," "resources," and "voices" as important equity dimensions. Implementing the framework through an iterative process, using justification criteria to manage movement among tiers, alongside equity considerations, will support adaptation to changing environmental and social conditions and contribute to risk reduction at scale. Though this approach is focused on U.S. flood management and adaptation, prioritizing risk reduction, elimination of risk, and accommodation of hazards over the defense against threats not only has global applicability to flood adaptation, but should also be evaluated for applicability to other climate-driven challenges.

However, these projections are subject to uncertainties originating from different sources. In this study, we explored the possible changes in future streamflow, particularly for high and low flows, under climate change in the Qu River basin, eastern China. ANOVA (analysis of variance) was employed to quantify the contribution of different uncertainty sources from RCPs (representative concentration pathways), GCMs (global climate models) and internal climate variability, using an ensemble of 4 RCP scenarios, 9 GCMs and 1000 simulated realizations of each model-scenario combination by SDRM-MCREM (a stochastic daily rainfall model coupling a Markov chain model with a rainfall event model). The results show that annual mean flow and high flows are projected to increase and that low flows will probably decrease in 2041-2070 (2050s) and 2071-2100 (2080s) relative to the historical period of 1971-2000, suggesting a higher risk of floods and droughts in the future in the Qu River basin, especially for the late 21st century. Uncertainty in mean flows is mostly attributed to GCM uncertainty. For high flows and low flows, internal climate variability and GCM uncertainty are two major uncertainty sources for the 2050s and 2080s, while for the 2080s, the effect of RCP uncertainty becomes more pronounced, particularly for low flows. The findings in this study can help water managers to become more knowledgeable about and get a better understanding of streamflow projections and support decision making regarding adaptations to a changing climate under uncertainty in the Qu River basin.

Here we examined changes of terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites in the lower MRB during 2003-2020, and subse-quently partitioned and attributed them into climate-driven and non-climate-driven components using the WaterGAP hydrological model (WGHM) with and without consideration of human activities, together with a statistical method driven by climatic forcing only. Further, integrated future TWSA was projected under different climate change scenarios during 2030-2099 forced with four downscaled and bias-corrected simulations of four global climate models. Results show a decreasing TWSA trend of-3.7 +/- 1.8 mm/a during 2003-2020. The WGHM-based climate-driven TWSA, which is highly correlated with the statistical modeling results, and non -climate-driven part suggests a trend of-0.3 +/- 1.4 and 0.01 +/- 0.07 mm/a during 2003-2016, respectively. The climate-driven TWSA is well explained by the changes in decreasing precipitation (-1.3 +/- 8.5 mm/a) and increasing air temperature (0.05 +/- 0.02 celcius/a) spatially and temporally, while the non-climate-driven component is closely linked to human activities such as growing sectoral human withdrawal (0.13 +/- 0.14 mm/a), increasing reservoir regulation (0.01 +/- 0.08 mm/a), and changing land cover. TWSA under future climate changes is projected to increase from 9.3 +/- 21.4 to 12.2 +/- 12.2 mm and from 1.6 +/- 41.2 to 12.3 +/- 30 mm in the near (2040-2059) and far future (2080-2099) under various scenarios comparing with the historical period (2003-2020). Future flood potential, estimated with TWSA and precipitation, was also projected to increase. This study provides important inferences for decision-makers and stakeholders to better understand the water cycle and manage water resources in a changing environment.

The existing health damage factors associated with CO2 emission are based on the findings compiled by the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) report. An updated version of the 2014 WHO report is now available, and based on its contents, this study aimed to estimate relative risk (RR) and calculate health damage factors for each shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenario.MethodsDamage factors (DALY/kg-CO2) were calculated as increment of temperature (degrees C/kg) multiplied by increment of RR per degrees C, base mortality rate without climate change (-), population, and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) per case of death. RRs and base mortality rates were calculated for each SSP scenario. RRs by SSP scenario were estimated based on the RRs of three economic growth scenarios (high growth, base case, and low growth), which were calculated based on the results of the 2014 WHO report. Base mortality rates for each SSP scenario were calculated based on its relationship with gross domestic product per capita.Results and discussionIn relation to undernutrition, diarrhea, malaria, dengue, heat stress, and coastal floods, the health damage factors (DALY/kg) for the SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 scenarios were 1.3x10(-6), 1.5x10(-6), and 2.0x10(-6), respectively. During a 100-year evaluation period, the damage factors obtained in the current study were 3-5 times higher than those in previous studies mainly because relative risk per degree Celsius (RR/degrees C) in the 2014 WHO report was larger than that in the 2004 WHO report. When RRs were estimated for each SSP scenario, the RR of SSP3 (with higher base mortality) was relatively low, particularly in case of undernutrition. Therefore, differences in the damage factors between the scenarios were more likely smaller than before when a single RR was used.ConclusionsNew health damage factors for the SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3 scenarios were estimated using an updated RR calculated based on the 2014 WHO report. These factors can be further updated in the future using RRs obtained from upcoming researches on climate-related health impact that were based on SSP scenarios.

In addition, climate change is expected to result in expressive increases in wave heights due to more intense and frequent storms, which, in conjunction with sea-level rise (SLR), has the potential to exacerbate the impact of storm surges on coastal communities. The ability to predict and simulate such events provides a powerful tool for coastal risk reduction and adaptation. In this context, this study aims to investigate how accurately storm surge events can be simulated in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean employing the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN hydrodynamic and phase-averaged wave numerical modeling framework given the significant data scarcity constraints of the region. The model's total water level (TWL) and significant wave height (Hs) outputs, driven by different sources of meteorological forcing, i.e., the Fifth Generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA 5), the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2), and the Global Forecast System (GFS), were validated for three recent storm events that affected the coast (2016, 2017, and 2019). In order to assess the potentially increasing storm surge impacts due to sea-level rise, a case study was implemented to locally evaluate the modeling approach using the most accurate model setup for two 2100 SLR projections (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Despite a TWL underestimation in all sets of simulations, the CFSv2 model stood out as the most consistent meteorological forcing for the hindcasting of the storm surge and waves in the numerical model, with an RMSE range varying from 0.19 m to 0.37 m, and an RMSE of 0.56 m for Hs during the most significant event. ERA5 was highlighted as the second most accurate meteorological forcing, while adequately simulating the peak timings. The SLR study case demonstrated a possible increase of up to 82% in the TWL during the same event. Despite the limitations imposed by the lack of continuous and densely distributed observational data, as well as up to date topobathymetric datasets, the proposed framework was capable of expanding TWL and Hs information, previously available for a handful of gauge stations, to a spatially distributed and temporally unlimited scale. This more comprehensive understanding of such extreme events represents valuable knowledge for the potential implementation of more adequate coastal management and engineering practices for the Brazilian coastal zone, especially under changing climate conditions.

Hopanoids Confer Robustness to Physicochemical Variability in the Niche of the Plant Symbiont <i>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</i>	JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY			English	Article						bradyrhizobia; climate change; hopanoids; osmotic stress; robustness; soil microbiology	OUTER-MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY; PUTIDA F1 CLONING; PERIBACTEROID SPACE; CATABOLIC PATHWAY; FLUIDITY; GROWTH; ACIDIFICATION; INOCULATION; CHOLESTEROL; NODULATION	Rhizobia are a group of bacteria that increase soil nitrogen content through symbiosis with legume plants. The soil and symbiotic host are potentially stressful environments, and the soil will likely become even more stressful as the climate changes. Many rhizobia within the Bradyrhizobium clade, like Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, possess the genetic capacity to synthesize hopanoids, steroid-like lipids similar in structure and function to cholesterol. Hopanoids are known to protect against stresses relevant to the niche of B. diazoefficiens. Paradoxically, mutants unable to synthesize the extended class of hopanoids participate in symbioses with success similar to that of the wild type, despite being delayed in root nodule initiation. Here, we show that in B. diazoefficiens, the growth defects of extended-hopanoid-deficient mutants can be at least partially compensated for by the physicochemical environment, specifically, by optimal osmotic and divalent cation concentrations. Through biophysical measurements of lipid packing and membrane permeability, we show that extended hopanoids confer robustness to environmental variability. These results help explain the discrepancy between previous in-culture and in planta results and indicate that hopanoids may provide a greater fitness advantage to rhizobia in the variable soil environment than the more controlled environments within root nodules. To improve the legume-rhizobium symbiosis through either bioengineering or strain selection, it will be important to consider the full life cycle of rhizobia, from soil to symbiosis. IMPORTANCE Rhizobia, such as B. diazoefficiens, play an important role in the nitrogen cycle by making nitrogen gas bioavailable through symbiosis with legume plants. As climate change threatens soil health, this symbiosis has received increased attention as a more sustainable source of soil nitrogen than the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Efforts to use rhizobia as biofertilizers have been effective; however, long-term integration of rhizobia into the soil community has been less successful. This work represents a small step toward improving the legume-rhizobium symbiosis by identifying a cellular component-hopanoid lipids-that confers robustness to environmental stresses rhizobia are likely to encounter in soil microenvironments as sporadic desiccation and flooding events become more common.

J	Bian, GD; Wang, GQ; Chen, J; Zhang, JY; Song, MM				Bian, Guodong; Wang, Guoqing; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Jianyun; Song, Mingming			Spatial and seasonal variations of hydrological responses to climate and land-use changes in a highly urbanized basin of Southeastern China	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; hydrological response; land-use change; Qinhuai River basin; SWAT	RIVER-BASIN; STREAMFLOW; IMPACTS; RUNOFF; FLOW	Climate and land-use changes are two major factors that significantly affect the watershed hydrology cycle. It is essential for regional water resource management to quantitatively assess the respective hydrological impact of these two factors. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was constructed to quantify the contributions of climate and land-use changes to runoff at the annual and seasonal time scales in the Qinhuai River basin (QRB), where significant urbanization occurred from 1986 to 2015. Moreover, based on the partial least squares regression, the specific impact of individual land-use change on major hydrological components was evaluated at the sub-basin scale. The results showed that: (1) the predominant patterns of land-use change in the QRB included the transformations from paddy fields to urban areas and dry lands, forest to dry lands and dry lands to urban areas; (2) the flood seasonal precipitation series and all air temperature series had significant increasing trends over 1986-2015, and annual and seasonal runoff series had significant increasing trends and had an abrupt change point in 2001; (3) the average annual, flood seasonal, and non-flood seasonal runoff increased 238.5, 130.2 and 108.3 mm, of which land-use change was responsible for 77.6, 55.1, and 104.8% of the increases, respectively, while climate change was responsible for 22.4, 44.9, and -4.8%, respectively and (4) the hydrological response to land-use change showed an obvious decrease in actual evapotranspiration (ET) and significant increases in surface runoff and baseflow. The decrease of ET and increase of baseflow could be attributed to the conversion patterns from paddy fields and forest to dry lands, while the conversions from paddy fields and dry lands to urban areas caused a remarkable increase in surface runoff in the QRB. The study demonstrated that these practicable approaches were beneficial for the more unbiased views of the hydrological responses to climate change and land-use changes in the highly urbanized basin, which were also critical for the sustainable development of regional water resource and future land-use planning.

Reimagining infrastructure for a biodiverse future	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						nature-based solutions; climate change; sustainable development; conservation; future cities	LAND MANAGEMENT; ECONOMIC VALUE; ECOSYSTEM; CONSERVATION; FLOODPLAINS; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; SERVICES; IMPACTS; JUSTICE	Civil infrastructure will be essential to face the interlinked existential threats of climate change and rising resource demands while ensuring a livable Anthropocene for all. However, conventional infrastructure planning largely neglects the contributions and maintenance of Earth's ecological life support systems, which provide irreplaceable services supporting human well- being. The stability and performance of these services depend on biodiversity, but conventional infrastructure practices, narrowly focused on controlling natural capital, have inadvertently degraded biodiversity while perpetuating social inequities. Here, we envision a new infrastructure paradigm wherein bio- diversity and ecosystem services are a central objective of civil engineering. In particular, we reimagine infrastructure practice such that 1) ecosystem integrity and species conservation are explicit objectives from the outset of project planning; 2) infrastructure practices integrate biodiversity into diverse project portfolios along a spectrum from conventional to nature-based solutions and natural habitats; 3) ecosystem functions reinforce and enhance the performance and lifespan of infrastructure assets; and 4) civil engineering promotes environmental justice by counteracting legacies of social inequity in infrastructure development and nature conservation. This vision calls for a fundamental rethinking of the standards, practices, and mission of infrastructure development agencies and a broadening of scope for conservation science. We critically examine the legal and professional precedents for this paradigm shift, as well as the moral and economic imperatives for manifesting equitable infrastructure planning that mainstreams biodiversity and nature's benefits to people. Finally, we set an applied research agenda for supporting this vision and highlight financial, professional, and policy pathways for achieving it.

However, the role of local-regional human activities during a transformation between Hellenism and the Roman Imperial period and supra-regional climate fluctuations is still under discussion. Five sediment profiles from the alluvial fan of the rural Deliktas catchment are analyzed and radiocarbon-dated to provide a sedimentological record covering the Holocene. Our results indicate seven phases of changing sediment dynamics. Five Holocene cycles of coarse- and fine-textured fan sediment deposition covered the paleochannel deposits of the caylak creek, and the floodplain sediments of the receiving Geyikli river which aggraded toward the piedmont during the Mid-Holocene. The landscape became stable on the Deliktas fan and Geyikli floodplain at least ca. 4-3.4 cal ka BP as indicated by paleosols. These paleosols were again buried by fan sediments marking the first phase of accelerated geomorphodynamics during the Late Holocene. Both the local onset of human activities and the regional Mid-Holocene aridization with rapid climate changes play a role. The increased number of archeological sites and high human pressure on the environment during the Hellenistic-Roman transformation in the Deliktas area and Pergamon micro-region were hypothesized to contribute to a phase of increased geomorphodynamic activity during the last 2.5 ka. This, however, is less apparent in our record. Our study emphasizes the importance of both, the climatic system and rural-urban cultural history, on landscape development, suggesting potential responses of locally diverse geomorphodynamics on regional-scale transformation in the eastern Mediterranean.

This applies in particular to human health - also in Europe. While cardiovascular, pneumological and dermatological diseases related to the climate crisis are often discussed, the crisis' significant gastroenterological consequences for health must also be considered.Methods A literature search (Pubmed, Cochrane Library) was used to identify papers with relevance particularly to the field of gastroenterology in (Central) Europe. Findings were supplemented and discussed by an interdisciplinary team.Results The climate crisis impacts the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal diseases in Europe due to more frequent and severe heat waves, flooding and air pollution. While patients with intestinal diseases are particularly vulnerable to acute weather events, the main long-term consequences of climate change are gastrointestinal cancer and liver disease. In addition to gastroenteritis, other infectious diseases such as vector-borne diseases and parasites are important in the context of global warming, heat waves and floods.Discussion Adaptation strategies must be consistently developed and implemented for vulnerable groups. Patients at risk should be informed about measures that can be implemented individually, such as avoiding heat, ensuring appropriate hydration and following hygiene instructions. Recommendations for physical activity and a healthy and sustainable diet are essential for the prevention of liver diseases and carcinomas. Measures for prevention and the promotion of resilience can be supported by the physicians at various levels. In addition to efforts fostering sustainability in the immediate working environment, a system-oriented commitment to climate protection is important.

A Shortlisting Framework for Crop Diversification in the United Kingdom	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						climate change adaptation; underutilised crops; pedoclimate analysis; land evaluation; nutrition security	UNDERUTILIZED CROP; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	We present a systematic framework for nationwide crop suitability assessment within the UK to improve the resilience in cropping systems and nutrition security of the UK population. An initial suitability analysis was performed using data from 1842 crops at 2862 grid locations within the UK, using climate (temperature and rainfall) and soil (pH, depth, and texture) data from the UK Met Office and British Geological Survey. In the second phase, additional qualitative and quantitative data are collected on 56 crops with the highest pedoclimatic suitability and coverage across the UK. An exercise was conducted on crops within each category using a systematic ranking methodology that shortlists crops with high value across a multitude of traits. Crops were ranked based on their nutritional value (macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals) and on adaptive (resistance to waterlogging/flood, frost, shade, pest, weed, and diseases and suitability in poor soils) and physiological traits (water-use efficiency and yield). Other characteristics such as the number of special uses, available germplasm through the number of institutions working on the crops, and production knowledge were considered in shortlisting. The shortlisted crops in each category are bulbous barley (cereal), colonial bentgrass (fodder), Russian wildrye (forage), sea buckthorn (fruit), blue lupin (legume), shoestring acacia (nut), ochrus vetch (vegetable), spear wattle (industrial), scallion (medicinal), and velvet bentgrass (ornamental/landscape). These crops were identified as suitable crops that can be adopted in the UK. We further discuss steps in mainstreaming these and other potential crops based on a systematic framework that takes into account local farming system issues, land suitability, and crop performance modelling at the field scale across the UK.

The approach uses a coastal flood risk assessment that quantifies physical drivers alongside socio-economic well-being for coastal communities to provide a methodology for managing uncertain futures through causal relationships in System Dynamics. A New Zealand case study is used to illustrate the long-term economic impacts of inaction under different SLR projections and recognise critical tolerance thresholds to help exposed property owners plan their future. Modelling scenarios using this integrated approach identified two stand-out drivers that influence a behavioural response of communities to coastal inundation at the local scale: first, the ongoing likelihood of risk transfer to the insurance industry, and second, the decisions of households and firms to accept risk for the added value of coastal living. Model outputs suggest that the threat posed by coastal hazards drives a behavioural, socio-economic response that exceeds the initial economic exposure of capital assets. In the economic short term (1-10 years) and medium term (10-20 years), vulnerable communities accept the risk of capital loss and loss of insurability, favouring the amenity of coastal living. However, in the long term (+20 years), economic losses from repeat flooding increase risk-based insurance premiums, promote insurance withdrawal and drive negative corrections in property valuations. Unanticipated insights were obtained from the modelling, including the likely timing of tolerance thresholds, particularly the insurance withdrawal point, which is critical to insurer/consumer decision-making and community planning.

Understanding and analyzing changes in flow regimes from a multidimensional perspective is essential for water resources management. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed to quantitatively assess the hydrological condition of the basin in four aspects: river flow regime, ecological water demand, multiple time scales, and drivers. The health status of the Yuanjiang River was assessed using a com-bination of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and eco-flow metrics, and differences in different drivers at different time scales were quantified based on the Choudhury-Yang equation and the ABCD model. The results show that after the abrupt change of the Yuanjiang River in 2004, the runoff decreased by up to 72.97 mm, three of the five groups of IHA reached moderate alteration or above, and its ecological flow was in a tight state for a long time. In addition, the reduction of runoff by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is not negligible (contribution 40.56%, 6.91%), and the drastic changes in land use and the construction and operation of cascade reservoirs highlight the human impact (contribution 52.53%). Anthropogenic contributions to runoff changes deepen in the order of spring, summer, fall, and winter (6%, 51%, 83%, 95%), and on a monthly scale, human activities were the dominant factor in runoff variability in nine months (61-98%), with climatic factors driving runoff increases of 0.24-6.07 mm only in March, June, September, November, and December.

Study focus: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) recently announced an updated version of general circulation models (GCMs). This study investigated the performance of improved CMIP6 over those of CMIP5 with respect to precipitation and flood representations in the Mekong River Basin (MRB). The correlation and error comparison from the referenced precipitation exhibited a significant improvement in the peak value representation. Hence, the impacts of climate change on future floods in the MRB were simulated and assessed using a distributed rainfall-runoff-inundation model. New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicated that precipitation from CMIP6 had a higher correlation and a lower error coefficient than CMIP5. Similarly, the simulation of GCM ensembles of monthly discharge from CMIP6 exhibited a comparable average value to the observations, whereas CMIP5 underestimated the discharge simulations. The performance of the mean annual peak discharge improved from 37,220 m(3)/s (CMIP5) to 45,423 m(3)/s (CMIP6) compared to 43,521 m(3)/s (observation). The projections of future floods in the MRB from CMIP6 exhibited an increase of annual peak discharge at Chiang Saen, Vientiane, Pakse, and Kratie stations by 10-15%, 20-22%, and 24-29% for the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 10-18%, 24-29%, and 41-54% for the SSP5-8.5 scenario in the near future (2026-2050), mid-future (2051-2075), and far future (2076-2100), respectively. The statistical K-S test showed significant changes in all stations and projected periods with a p-value < 0.01.

The need to increase crop productivity in the context of global warming has fueled attempts to improve several key plant features such as photosynthetic performance, assimilate partitioning, and tolerance to environmental stresses. Chloroplast redox metabolism, including photosynthetic electron transport and CO2 reductive assimilation, are primary targets of most stress conditions, leading to excessive excitation pressure, photodamage, and propagation of reactive oxygen species. Alterations in chloroplast redox poise, in turn, provide signals that exit the plastid and modulate plant responses to the environmental conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes could provide novel tools to increase crop yield in suboptimal environments. We describe herein various interventions into chloroplast redox networks that resulted in increased tolerance to multiple sources of environmental stress. They included manipulation of endogenous components and introduction of electron carriers from other organisms, which affected not only stress endurance but also leaf size and longevity. The resulting scenario indicates that chloroplast redox pathways have an important impact on plant growth, development, and defense that goes beyond their roles in primary metabolism. Manipulation of these processes provides additional strategies for the design of crops with improved performance under destabilized climate conditions as foreseen for the future.

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11 degrees C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029. Therefore, intervention strategies in Andean basins should be supported by prospective studies that use these key variables of the system for an integrated management of water resources.

Potential adaptation strategies for climate change impact among flood-prone fish farmers in climate hotspot Uganda	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Fish farming; Climate risks; Flood-prone communities; Climate resilience	AQUACULTURE	Climate-induced floods are increasing in Africa. The need to evolve framework for adaptation to climate change impact (CCI) among flood-prone fish farmers necessitated this study. Based on availability, 60 farming active flood-experienced fish farmers were purposively selected from flood-prone (Gulu and Kibuku) regions in climate hotspot Uganda. These were assessed for CCI adaptation tendencies in their socioeconomics and farming operation/techniques (FOI) indices, CCI awareness, CCI adaptation strategies, and perceived required interventions (RIs) using structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed through descriptive and multivariate regression tools. Respondents were mostly male, adults, educated, Christian, married, medium-sized family, social group members, 1-5 years' experience, medium-sized farms, and government trained. Income was 1.0-6.0 million Ugx/year. In FOI, semi-intensive culture system, use of rainwater plus groundwater, small-sized (< 0.5 ha) ponds, ponds possession of inlets and outlets, seasonal farming and mixed culture/farming dominated. Most respondents were aware of CCI, while erratic rainfall with floods and prolonged drought mostly impacted farming. AS-Adaptation Strategy were changed stocking time and livelihood diversification. Communication technology and social group's membership enhanced adaptation, while inadequate awareness constrains adaptation. Respondents' RI(s) were tree planting, irrigation and pond perimeter trenching. Gender, government training, farm size, water sources and presence of inlet and outlets in ponds (FOI) predicted adaptation (R = 0.802, R-2 = 0.64, P < 0.05). Some socioeconomic, technical and awareness indices could assist CCI flexibility. However, the statistically significant predictors of adaptation, identified adaptive strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions could be integrated into a framework for effective CCI adaptation for sustainable fish farming in flood-prone scenarios.

Impact to Coral Reef Populations at Ha'ena and Pila'a, Kaua'i, Following a Record 2018 Freshwater Flood Event	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						bioindicators; climate change; coral reefs; community structure; freshwater kills; historic flooding event; Kaua&#8216; i; sedimentation	ORGANIC-CARBON; KANEOHE BAY; MULTI-TAXON; FISH; SEDIMENTS; SALINITY; LIGHT; TEMPERATURE; COMMUNITY; HAWAIIAN	Many corals and reef-dwelling organisms are susceptible to the impacts of storm events, which are typically characterized by large inputs of freshwater, sediment, and nutrients. The majority of storm effects are focused on shallow, nearshore reef flats, as low salinity and sedimentation tend to dissipate with depth and distance from shore. In April 2018, record rainfall on the northern coast of Kaua'i caused extensive flooding and landslides, introducing large amounts of freshwater and sediment into nearshore reefs. Using benthic and fish transects from 2016-2019 and temperature, sediment, and rainfall data gathered pre- and post-flood, this study aimed to quantify and explicate the effects of flooding on the various biotic populations of two reef habitats at Pila'a and Ha'ena, Kaua'i. Results from the shallow Pila'a reef suggest sediment and freshwater-associated declines in mean urchin abundance (-52.0%) and increases in mean coral bleaching (+54.5%) at the flood-prone eastern sector. Additionally, decreases in mean urchin (-65.7%) and fish (-42.3%) populations were observed at shallow Ha'ena transects, but not deep sites, supporting the occurrence of depth-specific affliction. Multivariate community-level analyses affirmed much of these results, showing a significant shift in community structure before and after the flood at both Pila'a and Ha'ena. The outcomes of this study are pertinent to strategic design and solution development by local aquatic resource managers, especially as anthropogenic climate change continues to increase the frequency, duration, and intensity of storm events.

Several vegetation types have been suggested as green roof top layers, depending on the region and the purpose of the roof. In a Mediterranean climate, the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) vegetation represents a particularly advantageous choice for green roofs since it does not require artificial irrigation and maintenance. However, the flood mitigation performance of CAM green roofs has not been investigated as adequately as other vegetation types. In this framework, we aim to define the potential retention capacity of a no maintenance-cost spontaneous CAM green roof, located at the entrance of the University of Cagliari (Italy) and to compare it to C3 vegetation type. The structure has been equipped with gauges to measure the water fluxes in and out of the roof. Local observations are used to calibrate a conceptual ecohydrological model. A 51-year rainfall time series and corresponding potential evapotranspiration are then used to simulate and compare the relative performance of green roofs vegetated with spontaneous CAM and more common C3 plants. Results show the good performances of the CAM green roof in mitigating rainfall extremes, with an average retention capacity of 0.52 over the whole investigated period, while C3 presents an index of retention equal to 0.71, but it requires frequent irrigation. Moreover, this work highlights some potential economic and environmental benefits of CAM green roof implementation in Mediterranean areas.

Environmental disasters and cities' high degree of exposure to these risks are well known. What is apparent is the close relationship between these disasters and the urban transformations generated by approaches which, quoting the writer Amitav Gohsh, can be defined as outcomes of the Great Derangement Era. Through our research and design project; we have outlined the need to break free from the uncanny feeling caused by the specific phenomena which make territories more fragile and vulnerable to extreme weather and climate events. The design process illustrated, which involved a small town in central-western Sardinia, is an example of how the construction of a new urban landscape and architecture can take place starting, not only from the contingent risks of emergency situations, but rather from the recognition of any potential risks. With the goal of setting up an open and sustainable territorial plan, the case study has been designed as an approach to climate adaptation even if in Sardinia the link between climate change and flood risk has not been studied in depth and no evidence of this link has yet emerged. The project scenarios of an urban plan for one of the local governments in Sardinia, highlighted in the paper, has been conceived as a path of coevolution between new urban transformations and ecological dynamics of the environment.

MASS MORTALITY OF THE EASTERN OYSTER <i>CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA</i> IN THE WESTERN MISSISSIPPI SOUND FOLLOWING UNPRECEDENTED MISSISSIPPI RIVER FLOODING IN 2019	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH			English	Article						oyster; Crassostrea virginica; climate change; freshwater intrusion; Gulf of Mexico; oyster reefs; water quality	GULF-OF-MEXICO; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION EVENTS; LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN; SALINITY; WATER; TEMPERATURE; DISTURBANCE; HYPOXIA; HABITAT	Globally, precipitation is expected to increase along with the rise of temperatures due to climate change, increasing the likelihood of freshwater intrusion into coastal ecosystems. In the spring and summer of 2019. heavy rainfall and snowmelt in the midwestern United States caused historic flooding of the Mississippi River, warranting two openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to reduce pressure on levees in New Orleans, LA. These openings released an unprecedented volume of freshwater into Lake Pontchartrain and subsequently into the Mississippi Sound. This study investigated the impacts of these freshwater releases on populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and water quality in the western Mississippi Sound and the Bay of St. Louis. Platforms housing oysters and water quality sensors that measured dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were deployed at oyster reef sites. At each reef, native oyster populations were assessed via dredge sampling to determine oyster survival. After 13 days, deployed oysters suffered 100% mortality at all sites except the Henderson Point Reef and Kittiwake Reef, the sites farthest east of the BCS. On September 27, 2019, 62 days following the BCS closing, dredge sampling revealed no live native adult oysters or spat, even at sites where living oysters were collected earlier in the summer. If BCS openings increase in frequency or duration because of elevated precipitation, oyster populations in Mississippi could remain unsustainable for harvesting unless future freshwater intrusions are incorporated into management planning.

Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with its abundant water, is caught in the middle of strategies to curb future effects of droughts, water scarcity and flooding across Africa. This article reviewed the current status of water and related biodiversity in DRC using a political economy, biological data and available social knowledge. Freshwaters hold the potentials to significantly contribute to the economy of DRC. However, fish stocks in some stretches of the Congo River are fished at intensities that exceed their productivity potential; water depths are decreasing in some others. Sources of the freshwaters of the Congo Basin cross borders of many countries but proper transboundary management plans to support cross-border sustainable management of freshwaters are lacking. Stakeholders do not own freshwater sustainable management plans; growing populations and the drying up of large portions of Africa make that freshwater of the Congo, rather than being a uniting factor of the region, instead a security threat that Congo River Basin countries need to care about immediately. Caution should prevail in ways in which the freshwaters of the Congo Basin are exploited. Particularly, lack of in-depth ecological knowledge about the biology and the mechanics of the Congo Basin's freshwaters call for careful scrutiny of the idea to export the freshwaters of Congo to refill the Lake Chad Basin as suggested by some politicians, since this could lead to an unprecedented ecological cataclysm.

The invasiveness and impact of these species on native species varies depending on their biological traits, and on environmental conditions, such as climate. In Japan, rainbow trout and brown trout, both listed in 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, occur as non-native species. The invasiveness of these two species is thought to be related to seasonal flooding, given flood waters can physically damage fry and prevent population establishment. Rainbow trout have successfully invaded waters in Hokkaido, northern Japan, where the likelihood of flooding is low between June and July, when their fry emerge, but successful invasions are rare in regions south of Hokkaido. Brown trout, however, have successfully invaded waters not only in Hokkaido, but also other regions. Since brown trout have a similar life history to the native white-spotted charr and masu salmon, with fry emerging before the flood season, they are more suited to the Japanese climate than Rainbow trout. Rainbow and brown trout interact with native species in various ways, but a common outcome of these interactions is the displacement of native charr species. Legal regulations of non-native salmonids should be based on understandings of the ecological traits of each invasive species and regional impacts on native species. Given the ongoing nature of climate change, the nature and extent of the effects of rainbow and brown trout on native species might also change.

Not only can climate change induce migration, but, I argue, climate shocks-which I define as discrete, unanticipated destruction due to weather such as floods, drought, or windstorms-can also destabilize gendered social systems. Climate shocks can initiate political transformations that open new space for women in representative politics. Additionally, they can compel women to mobilize-as representatives and their supporters-to redirect local and national political agendas to respond to the vulnerabilities exposed by climate shocks.

We apply each approach to Boston's network of plans to understand how the city's plans together address current and future flooding. We find relatively strong integration of plans in Boston. When combined, these four approaches provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding networks of plans.

In cases where several hazards can occur simultaneously or where the occurrence of one event will change the disposition of another, assessments need to account for complex process chains. While process chains are widely recognized as a major threat, no systematic analysis has hitherto been undertaken. We therefore establish new understanding on the factors that directly trigger or alter the disposition for subsequent events in the chain and derive a novel classification scheme and parameters to aid natural hazard assessment. Process chains in high mountains are commonly associated with glacier retreat or permafrost degradation. Regional differences exist in the nature and rate of sequencing-some process chains are almost instantaneous, while other linkages are delayed. Process chains involving rapid sequences are difficult to predict, and impacts are often devastating. We demonstrate that process chains are triggered most frequently by progressive failures, being the result of gradual landscape weakening and not due to the occurrence of a distinct process. If fluvial processes are part of the process chain the reach (or mobility) of process chains is increased. Increased mobility can also occur if sediment deposition areas along river channels are activated. As climate changes causes glacial environments to transform into sediment-rich paraglacial and fluvial landscapes, it is expected that the mobility of process chains will increase in the future. Communities and their infrastructure located in mountain regions of the world are particularly susceptible to natural hazards, such as floods and landslides. While these events on their own can be bad enough, when such events occur at the same time or cause a chain-reaction of different processes, consequences can be worse and extend far downstream. In view of this, we have undertaken a first comprehensive review of 51 relevant events occurring across different mountain regions globally to better understand how these process chains develop, and to identify which conditions increase the likelihood and or size of these events. A key finding is that process chains most frequently begin as the result of a mountain slope gradually becoming unstable over time, and in these cases, no other trigger such as an earthquake or unusually wet or hot weather are necessary. Far-reaching process chains occur when rivers are involved and when additional gravel and debris sources are added to the mix. As a consequence of climate warming, icy mountain landscapes are thawing and become more unstable, increasing the risk of such process chains in the future. High mountain hazard process chains commonly are associated with glacier retreat or permafrost degradationProcess chains are triggered most frequently by progressive failure, which is a result of long-lasting landscape weakeningAn important implication of climate change is that we can expect an increase in the reach (horizontal length along the flow path) of process chain events in the future	[Mani, Peter; Allen, Simon; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Evans, Stephen G.] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Environm & Informat Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Kargel, Jeffrey S.] Univ Arizona, Planetary Sci Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Mergili, Martin] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geog & Reg Sci, Graz, Austria; [Petrakov, Dmitry] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab ch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland	University of Geneva; University of Waterloo; University of Arizona; University of Graz; Lomonosov Moscow State University; University of Geneva; University of Geneva	Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.; Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab ch, Geneva, Switzerland.; Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.	markus.stoffel@unige.ch	Petrakov, Dmitry/H-5854-2011; Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017	Mergili, Martin/0000-0001-5085-4846; Stoffel, Markus/0000-0003-0816-1303	Joel Fiddes for providing the Google Earth Engine script to calculate local elevation ranges (LER).

As an example, the frequency and magnitude of river flooding are amplified by climate change: society needs to understand how to cope through learning, adaptative behaviour and planning. Choices should be informed by trusted science that can only be delivered by education, to avoid "knee jerk" post-hazard reactions. We examine curricula and resources in physical geography for England to judge if they make river science more pervasive and persuasive. Scales of causation and impact remain a central geographical focus. The concept of "place" is revitalized: environmental processes harnessed to improve resilience. Literacy and numeracy skills to communicate and predict need improving, to ensure that students understand problems sufficiently well to identify the best long-term, rigorously assessed options. Higher education has a hub role for empowering lay individuals, communities and professionals but the core learning principles need to be set at school. We conclude the current physical geography river science content is not fit for future needs, notably at A-Level. Weaknesses include naivety about river processes (water and sediment movement), arcane jargon, absence of a catchment-wide approach to river management, and inadequate links between disciplined fieldwork and databases. Contemporary community dimensions of social learning, argument and countering myths are also weakly developed.

The study demonstrates the operational state and reliability of the dam structure based on hydrologic assessment of the dam. The surrounding area is affected by heavy rainfall and climate change every year, which increases the probability of flooding and threatens a dense population downstream of the dam. This study evaluates the adequacy of dam spillways by considering the latest Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) and Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) values of the concerned dams. In this study, the PMP estimations are applied using comparison of both statistical method by Hershfield and National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) Envelope Curve as input for PMF establishments. Since the PMF is derived from the PMP values, the highest design flood standard can be applied to any dam, ensuring inflow into the reservoirs and limiting the risk of dam structural failure. Hydrologic modeling using HEC-HMS provides PMF values for the Batu dam. Based on the results, Batu Dam is found to have 200.6 m(3)/s spillway discharge capacities. Under PMF conditions, the Batu dam will not face overtopping since the peak outflow of the reservoir level is still below the crest level of the dam.

Climate change and extreme weather disasters: evacuation stress is associated with youths' somatic complaints	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						somatic complaints; adolescents; children; evacuation; climate change; disasters	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; HURRICANE-ANDREW; PHYSICAL HEALTH; PTSD SYMPTOMS; CHILD ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; RISK; ADOLESCENTS; EXPERIENCES; EXPOSURE	ObjectiveClimate-change has brought about more frequent extreme-weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods, and wildfires) that may require families to evacuate, without knowing precisely where and when the potential disaster will strike. Recent research indicates that evacuation is stressful for families and is associated with psychological distress. Yet, little is known about the potential impact of evacuation stressors on child health. After Hurricane Irma, which led to a mass evacuation in Florida, we examined whether evacuation stressors and hurricane exposure were uniquely associated with youth somatic complaints, and whether youth psychological distress (i.e., symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression) served as a potential mediating pathway between evacuation stressors, hurricane experiences, and somatic complaints. MethodThree months after Irma, 226 mothers of youth aged 7-17 years (N=226; M age = 9.76 years; 52% boys; 31% Hispanic) living in the five southernmost Florida counties reported on evacuation stressors, hurricane-related life threat and loss/disruption, and their child's psychological distress and somatic complaints using standardized measures. ResultsStructural equation modeling revealed a good model fit (& chi;(2) = 32.24, p = 0.003, CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.04). Even controlling for life-threatening hurricane experiences (& beta; = 0.26) and hurricane loss and disruption (& beta; = 0.26), greater evacuation stressors were associated with greater symptoms of youth psychological distress (& beta; = 0.34; p's < 0.001), and greater psychological distress was associated with more somatic complaints (& beta; = 0.67; p < 0.001). Indirect effects revealed that evacuation stressors (p < 0.001), actual life-threatening events (p < 0.01), and loss and disruption (p < 0.01) were all uniquely and indirectly associated with youths' somatic complaints via youth psychological distress. DiscussionFindings suggest that even coping with the threat of a disaster may be sufficient to prompt psychological and physical health symptoms in youth. Due in part to climate change, threats of disaster occur much more often than actual disaster exposure, especially for areas that are prone to hurricanes or wildfires. Preparing youth and families residing in vulnerable areas for potential disaster evacuation or sheltering-in-place appears critical. Encouraging families to develop Disaster Plans and teaching stress management skills may reduce both youth distress and somatic health problems.

Turpan Basin has a continental desert climate as it is located in central Eurasia and surrounded by mountains on all sides, with the lowest elevation of 154.5 m below sea level. Its rivers and water availability are mainly supplied by mountain snowmelt through surface streams and the Karez system. To assess the impact of climate change on streamflow in the Turpan basin, this study examined the long-term trends and change points of hydro-meteorological variables and explored the plausible correlation between them at annual and seasonal scales. A set of non-parametric statistical tests was applied to analyze the trend, its magnitude, and the change point of the hydro-meteorological variables from 1959 to 2012 in the Turpan basin. Results showed that the annual mean temperature had a significant increasing trend with an average warming rate of 0.26 degrees C/decade. Annual precipitation did not show a consistent upward or downward trend across the basin; however, there was a significant increase in winter precipitation. The increasing rates of streamflow at Alagou and Meiyaogou hydrological stations were the highest in the summer (0.42 and 0.18 m3/s per decade, respectively), which might increase the risk of flooding. The change points of various meteorological variables and streamflow can be generally found in the 1980s, in which temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and streamflow had abrupt changes concurrently in 1986 and had respectively increased by 7.2, 41.3, 5.7, and 18.3% after 1986. In general, the strength of the relationship between annual streamflow and precipitation (0.34) was greater than that between streamflow and temperature (0.16). The significant increase in temperature and agriculture in the basin in recent decades indicates the importance of reducing unnecessary soil evaporation in agriculture to preserve water resources under climate change and using innovative technology to preserve soil quality under increasing evapotranspiration and irrigation. This study provided valuable information for understanding the changing properties of the streamflow in the basin and insights for better-integrated water resources management planning that focuses on mitigating flood disasters and soil degradation and improving irrigation efficiency.

Historical climate research is an important part of the international Climate Variability and Predictability project. Based on the existing historical documents and literatures about counties and distributions in the Qinling Mountains from 1850 to 1959, we reconstructed a sequence of drought and flood grades. The characteristics of droughts and floods, including their phases, periodicity, and mutability in all regions from 1850 to 1959, were analyzed by employing the accumulative anomaly, wavelet analysis, and sliding t-test techniques. The results showed that there were 76 droughts and floods in the Qinling Mountains from 1850 to 1959, with droughts and floods occurred 29 and 47 times, respectively, accounting for 38.16% and 61.84% of the total events, respectively. The changes in drought and flood grade sequences in the Qinling Mountains had obvious phases, showing alternating dry and wet periods. A fluctuating climatic phase with both floods and droughts occurred from 1850 to 1879 and from 1949 to 1959; the climate was relatively wet from 1880 to 1912; the climate was relatively dry from 1913 to 1948. The seasonal variation in droughts in the Qinling mountains was concentrated on spring, summer, and back-to-back summer and autumn seasons; while the seasonal variation in floods was concentrated on summer and autumn, and back-to-back summer and autumn seasons. Moreover, there were two periods, 5 similar to 7 a and 11 a, that corresponded to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity cycle and were consistent with global climate change. Through the sliding t-test technique and comparison of the drought-flood change sequence, there were two common significant mutations on a decade scale and 20-year scale. The positive PSDI swings are conducive to increased flood occurrence and negative PSDI values to increased drought occurrence, and these changes have good consistency of changes in the two data sources, and also verify the good reliability of the reconstruction results in this paper.

We are using the output from four General Circulation Models downscaled by the method of Localized Constructed Analogues and provided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The daily data were used by SIO to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and derive a suite of 24 hydrologic and climate variables at a 1/16 (ca. 6 km) grid scale, for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Here we focus on trends in the return levels of extreme climatic events, including annual maximum daily discharge of six basin streams, maximum and total annual kinetic energy (KE) of raindrops falling on snow-free ground, basin-wide climatic water deficit, and wind speed. To analyze time trends in historic and modeled future extreme values, we applied the program extRemes, based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Values of KE on snow-free ground were derived by statistically disaggregating daily rainfall to hourly, and using literature values to convert rainfall intensity (mm/hr) for days without snowpack to KE (Joules/m2/hr). We found strong upward trends in extreme values, with most of the effect due to loss of snowpack, but a significant effect of increasing rainfall for one model. To estimate future trends in maximum annual daily discharge of six streams, we adjusted the modeled future annual maximum runoff to the distribution of gage data, using regression of gage data on modeled historic runoff at equal return intervals. The GEV results for the six streams, averaged across the four models, indicate an increase in the 20-year flood of 65-117 percent. Climatic water deficit showed strong upward trends for three of the four models, with a maximum at mid-century for one model. Averaged across the basin and across the four models, average and maximum seasonal winds under RCP 8.5 are projected to decrease slightly in all seasons. The trends in averages and extreme values that we found will have important effects on vegetation, wildfire severity, flood hazards and the clarity of Lake Tahoe.

The Yangtze River (YR) economic belt has continued to experience frequent flood disasters over the years; therefore, clarifying the significant flood risk factors is highly relevant for the development of the region. In this study, we investigated the flood risk factors in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) during 2002-2018 based on meteorological data, reconstructed terrestrial water storage (TWS) data from Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment (GRACE) (GRACE-TWS), and Landsat data. The major conclusions were as follows: (1) the principal components (i.e., the first, third, and fourth principal components (PC1, PC3, and PC4)) of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at a 12-month scale (SPEI12) were more significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with teleconnection indices (i.e., Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Southern Oscillation Indices (SOO, and Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI)), than the SPEI at 6-month scale (SPEI6) in the YRB during 2002-2018; (2) the changes in water bodies reflected by Landsat data (i.e., Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 OLI) for the YRB confirmed the wet periods (i.e., 2002-2005, 2010, 2012-2013, and 2015-2018) monitored by SPEI (i.e., SPEI6 and SPEI12); and (3) while the Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a significant linear relationship between the major hydrological factors (e.g., precipitation, runoff, GRACE-TWS, flood potential index (FPI), and soil moisture (SM)) in the YRB, the precipitation detected by the GRACE-TWS and SM with one-month lag phase, had the maximum correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. Significant relationships (r(2) = 0.48 and r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.05) were found between variable infiltration capacity (VIC)-runoff and predicted runoffs based on these factors (i.e., precipitation, GRACE-TWS, flood potential index (FPI), and SM) and the random forest regression. This study provides significant hydrological information and contributes to approaches aimed at supporting climate resilience and investments in the YRB.

Key priorities are balancing flood risk and hydropower production, and improving aquatic ecosystem function while incorporating projected effects of climate change. In support of the US effort, Chegwidden et al. (2017) developed a large-ensemble dataset of past and future daily streamflows at 396 sites throughout the Columbia River basin (CRB) and selected other watersheds in western Washington and Oregon, using state-of-the art climate and hydrologic models. In this study, we use that dataset to present new analyses of the effects of future climate change on flooding using water year maximum daily streamflows. For each simulation, flood statistics are estimated from generalized extreme value distributions fit to simulated water year maximum daily streamflows for 50-year windows of the past (1950-1999) and future (2050-2099) periods. Our results contrast with previous findings: we find that the vast majority of locations in the CRB are estimated to experience an increase in future streamflow magnitudes. The near ubiquity of increases is all the more remarkable in that our approach explores a larger set of methodological variation than previous studies; however, like previous studies, our modeling system was not calibrated to minimize error in maximum daily streamflow and may be affected by unquantifiable errors. We show that on the Columbia and Willamette rivers increases in streamflow magnitudes are smallest downstream and grow larger moving upstream. For the Snake River, however, the pattern is reversed, with increases in streamflow magnitudes growing larger moving downstream to the confluence with the Salmon River tributary and then abruptly dropping. We decompose the variation in results attributable to variability in climate and hydrologic factors across the ensemble, finding that climate contributes more variation in larger basins, while hydrology contributes more in smaller basins. Equally important for practical applications like flood control rule curves, the seasonal timing of flooding shifts dramatically on some rivers (e.g., on the Snake, 20th-century floods occur exclusively in late spring, but by the end of the 21st century some floods occur as early as December) and not at all on others (e.g., the Willamette River).

Mortgage Finance and Climate Change: Securitization Dynamics in the Aftermath of Natural Disasters	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article						D14; E6; G21; G22; Q54; R00	BACKED SECURITIES; RISK; EQUILIBRIUM; MARKET; INFERENCE; DEFAULT; PRICES; MODEL	Using the government-sponsored enterprises' sharp securitization rules, this paper provides evidence that, in the aftermath of natural disasters, lenders are more likely to approve mortgages that can be securitized, thereby transferring climate risk. The identification strategy uses the time-varying conforming loan limits above which the government-sponsored enterprises do not securitize mortgages. Natural disasters lead to more securitization right below the limit, suggesting an increased option value of securitization. A model identified using indirect inference simulates increasing disaster risk without GSEs. Mortgage credit supply would decline in flood zones and lenders would have a greater incentive to screen mortgages.

Reimagining large river management using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework in the Upper Mississippi River	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Ecosystem; Management; Transformation; Social-ecological system; Anthropocene; Climate change; Basin planning; Cross-scale interactions	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ILLINOIS RIVER; CONSERVATION; FLOODPLAIN; IMPLEMENTATION; TEMPERATURE; INUNDATION; MIGRATION; BARRIERS	Background Large-river decision-makers are charged with maintaining diverse ecosystem services through unprecedented social-ecological transformations as climate change and other global stressors intensify. The interconnected, dendritic habitats of rivers, which often demarcate jurisdictional boundaries, generate complex management challenges. Here, we explore how the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework may enhance large-river management by promoting coordinated and deliberate responses to social-ecological trajectories of change. The RAD framework identifies the full decision space of potential management approaches, wherein managers may resist change to maintain historical conditions, accept change toward different conditions, or direct change to a specified future with novel conditions. In the Upper Mississippi River System, managers are facing social-ecological transformations from more frequent and extreme high-water events. We illustrate how RAD-informed basin-, reach-, and site-scale decisions could: (1) provide cross-spatial scale framing; (2) open the entire decision space of potential management approaches; and (3) enhance coordinated inter-jurisdictional management in response to the trajectory of the Upper Mississippi River hydrograph.Results The RAD framework helps identify plausible long-term trajectories in different reaches (or subbasins) of the river and how the associated social-ecological transformations could be managed by altering site-scale conditions. Strategic reach-scale objectives may reprioritize how, where, and when site conditions could be altered to contribute to the basin goal, given the basin's plausible trajectories of change (e.g., by coordinating action across sites to alter habitat connectivity, diversity, and redundancy in the river mosaic).Conclusions When faced with long-term systemic transformations (e.g., > 50 years), the RAD framework helps explicitly consider whether or when the basin vision or goals may no longer be achievable, and direct options may open yet unconsidered potential for the basin. Embedding the RAD framework in hierarchical decision-making clarifies that the selection of actions in space and time should be derived from basin-wide goals and reach-scale objectives to ensure that site-scale actions contribute effectively to the larger river habitat mosaic. Embedding the RAD framework in large-river decisions can provide the necessary conduit to link flexibility and innovation at the site scale with stability at larger scales for adaptive governance of changing social-ecological systems.

The study pertaining to change in the spatio-temporal patterns of rainfall dynamics is crucial to take appropriate actions for managing the water resources at regional level and to prepare for extreme events such as floods and droughts. Therefore, our study has investigated the spatio-temporal distribution and performance of seasonal rainfall for all districts of Haryana, India. The gridded rainfall datasets of 120 years (1901 to 2020) from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) were categorically analysed and examined with statistical results using mean rainfall, rainfall deviation, moving-average, rainfall categorization, rainfall trend, correlation analysis, probability distribution function, and climatology of heavy rainfall events. During each season, the eastern districts of Haryana have received more rainfall than those in its western equivalent. Rainfall deviation has been positive during the pre-monsoon season, while it has been negative for all remaining seasons during the third quad-decadal time (QDT3, covering the period of 1981-2020); rainfall has been declining in most of Haryana's districts during the winter, summer monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons in recent years. The Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) shows a declining trend in rainfall during the winter, post-monsoon, and summer monsoon seasons while an increasing trend occurs during the pre-monsoon season. Heavy rainfall events (HREs) were identified for each season from the last QDT3 (1981-2020) based on the available data and their analysis was done using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim), which helped in understanding the dynamics of atmospheric parameters during HREs. Our findings are highlighting the qualitative and quantitative aspects of seasonal rainfall dynamics at the districts level in Haryana state. This study is beneficial in understanding the impact of climate change and climate variability on rainfall dynamics in Haryana, which may further guide the policymakers and beneficiaries for optimizing the use of hydrological resources.

Within this context, the present study aims at characterizing at the berry level the physiological response of Vitis vinifera cv. Sauvignon Blanc to sequential stresses simulated under a semi-controlled environment: flooding at bud-break followed by multiple summer stress (drought plus heatwave) occurring at pre-veraison. Transcriptomic and metabolomic assessments were performed through RNASeq and NMR, respectively. A comprehensive hormone profiling was also carried out. Results pointed out a different response to the heatwave in the two situations. Flooding caused a developmental advance, determining a different physiological background in the berry, thus affecting its response to the summer stress at both transcriptional levels, with the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress responses, and metabolic level, with the increase in osmoprotectants, such as proline and other amino acids. In conclusion, sequential stress, including a flooding event at bud-break followed by a summer heatwave, may impact phenological development and berry ripening, with possible consequences on berry and wine quality. A berry physiological model is presented that may support the development of sustainable vineyard management solutions to improve the water use efficiency and adaptation capacity of actual viticultural systems to future scenarios.

Groundwater Rise and Associated Flooding in Coastal Settlements Due To Sea-Level Rise: A Review of Processes and Methods	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Review							SEAWATER INTRUSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND SUBSIDENCE; WATER FLOW; MANAGEMENT; AQUIFER; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; INFILTRATION; INUNDATION	Coastal settlements are experiencing the effects of climate change-induced sea-level rise, including a significant but often poorly-characterized impact on groundwater. The shallow water tables present in the built coastal environment contribute to an increased risk from natural hazards such as groundwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. Historical urban development was accompanied by impacts on shallow groundwater, and in the future subsurface environments, including underground infrastructure, will face additional pressure. This article reviews processes of the coastal groundwater zone and simulation tools used to evaluate possible impacts of sea-level rise. The benefits and limitations of the two main methods to assess coastal groundwater rise and contribution to flooding are discussed using studies and investigations up to 2021. The review addresses challenges associated with the simulation tools to evaluate changes in urban hydrogeology due to sea-level rise. The models reviewed do not specifically estimate groundwater contribution to land-surface flooding. We highlight a critical need for methodology comparisons between spatial interpolation and numerical tools that will guide future work. An adequate validation of assessment methods is required and will be supported by improved coastal groundwater monitoring networks focused on water quality, saltwater intrusion, and continuous groundwater levels records. From current monitoring practices, evidence for groundwater rise with rising sea level is not widely observed at present. New monitoring sites are recommended near the coastline and tidally influenced surface water bodies, to better evaluate the rise of the water table and impacts on infrastructure.

J	Bang, HN; Burton, NC				Bang, Henry Ngenyam; Burton, Nicholas Church			Contemporary flood risk perceptions in England: Implications for flood risk management foresight	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flooding; Climate change; Flood risk perception; Flood risk management; Climate risk management; England	COMMUNICATION; COMMUNITY	Although England has been experiencing major floods dating back thousands of years, the hazard is increasing in frequency and intensity, exacerbated by climate risks with potentially serious consequences. Despite attempts to mitigate climate risks (manifested via recurrent flooding) in line with international disaster risk reduction agendas, the impacts/effects of floods continue to increase in England. This is partly due to negligence in inculcating contemporary flood risk perceptions (FRP) into climate risk management (CRM) strategies. This research aims to investigate contemporary FRM in England through a qualitative case study approach in Wainfleet All Saints in Lincolnshire County that experienced unprecedented floods in June 2019. Empirical investigation was conducted with the flood-affected community members and flood managers with oversight of CRM in the region. Key findings reveal the June 2019 floods had both tangible and intangible impacts for the affected community with dreadful effects. Challenges to CRM revealed issues around limited funding; climate changes' potential to increase flood risk and low community perception of their own risks reflected in poor/none-preparedness for contemporary floods. The multi-agency response to the June 2019 floods was found to be positive, albeit with a few concerns. Based on the analysis of the findings, a series of policy recommendations are proffered with the aim to spur organisational/institutional resilience to CRM. This article underscores the relevance to continuously include contemporary FRP into CRM strategies especially to enhance community participation and involvement in mitigating their own risks.

Contribution of historical precipitation change to US flood damages	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						precipitation; flooding; climate change	UNITED-STATES; INTENSE PRECIPITATION; EXTREME-PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; CLIMATE; TRENDS; LOSSES; ATTRIBUTION; WEATHER	Precipitation extremes have increased across many regions of the United States, with further increases anticipated in response to additional global warming. Quantifying the impact of these precipitation changes on flood damages is necessary to estimate the costs of climate change. However, there is little empirical evidence linking changes in precipitation to the historically observed increase in flood losses. We use >6,600 reports of state-level flood damage to quantify the historical relationship between precipitation and flood damages in the United States. Our results show a significant, positive effect of both monthly and 5-d state-level precipitation on state-level flood damages. In addition, we find that historical precipitation changes have contributed approximately one-third of cumulative flood damages over 1988 to 2017 (primary estimate 36%; 95% CI 20 to 46%), with the cumulative impact of precipitation change totaling $73 billion (95% CI 39 to $91 billion). Further, climate models show that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased the probability of exceeding precipitation thresholds at the extremely wet quantiles that are responsible for most flood damages. Climate models project continued intensification of wet conditions over the next three decades, although a trajectory consistent with UN Paris Agreement goals significantly curbs that intensification. Taken together, our results quantify the contribution of precipitation trends to recent increases in flood damages, advance estimates of the costs associated with historical greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further evidence that lower levels of future warming are very likely to reduce financial losses relative to the current global warming trajectory.

In this study, the timing of seasons was determined using non-fixed threshold methods. Twelve new timing indices were defined to account for shifts in seasons and season onset day, thermal centroid day, and length. The Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen's slope estimator, sequential Mann-Kendall test, and least square linear regression were used to assess trends. The timing indices were examined using data from two meteorological stations in Iran with 50 years of records. Spatio-temporal variations in each index over 30 years (1987-2016) were then determined for Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran. Trend analysis for several indices indicated that the timing of seasons had probably changed in the south and west of the study area, while mountainous regions showed non-significant trends. Based on the hottest and coldest 90-day periods (summer and winter, respectively), during the three decades studied, spring lengthened by 5-10 days/decade in the plain region of Khuzestan province and autumn shortened by about 5-8 days/decade. The centroid of winter occurred earlier, by 2-5 days/decade, in the plains area, while the thermal centroid of summer did not change significantly. Overall, the difference between the thermal centroid of winter and summer (Cwin-sum) in the plains area significantly decreased, by 6-8 days/decade, in the 30-year period.

However, there is limited knowledge on specific indicators suitable for assessing social vulnerability on Sarawak. This study systematically analyzed important components of vulnerability and mapped them by weight for the 12 different divisions. Indices focusing on components of the two different dimensions of vulnerability (physical exposure and resistances) were identified based on the literature. Data on these different indices were then collected through relevant government agencies. Components of vulnerability dimensions were assessed and significantly contributing components were identified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An entropy method was used to weight the dimensions of vulnerability for the different divisions. Vulnerability was estimated based on the Iyengar and Sudarshan methodology and the data were used to produce a vulnerability map based on a proposed Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The results indicated that divisions of Kuching, Miri, Sibu and Bintulu were more vulnerable (score over than 0.81) than those in other divisions. Greater vulnerability was mainly due to high exposure to extreme events and less adaptive capacity of resistance, which can affect agricultural production negatively, in combination with high population density in communities. The map clearly shows which areas are more susceptible, indicating that the government's adaptation measures should vary depending on the available resources, urgency, and means of survival needed to achieve resilience against climate change.

The results show that, on the centennial scale, drought and flood variation in the basin exhibited two dry periods (early fifteenth century to early sixteenth century, early twentieth century to the present) and one four-century long wet period (early sixteenth to early twentieth centuries), with multi-decadal drought and flood fluctuations within each period. Meanwhile, the variation shows some regional differences. For example, droughts and floods both occurred at high rates in the whole river basin during the twentieth century, with the increase in droughts relatively more remarkable in the upper reaches and the increase in floods more notable in the middle and lower reaches; throughout the study period, the drought and flood variability was larger in the upper reaches, but the drought and flood frequency was higher in the middle and lower reaches. In addition, there are a few quasi-cycles of the drought and flood variability in the middle and lower reaches, which include the quasi-cycles of 2-8 years, 10-30 years, 50 years, and 80-100 years, respectively. The upper reaches are slightly different, which have the quasi-cycles of 3-5 years, 10-30 years, and 70-80 years, respectively.

Water and wastewater treatment plants, electricity generation facilities, bridges, highways, population centers, and other dams often lie downstream of a dam. If poorly maintained, aging dams can be overtopped by extreme rainfall events, and long-term loss of critical infrastructure services for many communities and regions may result. Such events are now more likely as the climate changes. How should we prioritize dams that need immediate attention and retrofit or remove them? Losses from a dam failure could exceed the infrastructure's replacement costs, through cascading effects in multiple sectors such as electricity, transportation, water supply, and environmental services. The existing dam hazard classification frameworks in the US and many other countries do not formally characterize "hazard hotspots" considering these impacts. Given that there are over 90,000 dams at different stages of repair, maintenance, and budgetary constraints, a systematic approach is needed to rank their potential failure hazard and allocate resources for risk mitigation. In this paper, we synthesize an approach for preliminary ranking of the priority areas of concern. The approach is scalable over many regions for rapid assessment of magnitude and exposure of a dam failure. The estimation of the consequences of a dam failure, including its financial losses, as well as affected critical infrastructures and population, is explored using publicly available dam break and consequence tools as well as national infrastructure data sets.

Coastal Migration Index for Coastal Flooding Events Increased by Sea Level Rise due to Climate Change: Mexico and Cuba Case Studies	WATER			English	Article						coastal vulnerability; coastal management; coastal environmental sustainability; stoplight map; hurricanes	GULF-OF-MEXICO; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; INTEGRATED COASTAL; ZONE MANAGEMENT; AREAS; EROSION; IMPACT; MODEL; METHODOLOGY; ADAPTATION	This paper presents a coastal migration index (CMI) useful for decision-making in the current scenario of sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change. The CMI includes coastal human population density, degree of urbanization, and coastal-flooding penetration. Quantitative and qualitative statistical techniques and the geographic information system ArcGIS View 9.0 were used. Further, a panel of fifteen international experts in coastal management issues was consulted to establish and validate the CMI. Results led to three index components based on 22 indicators. CMI was applied in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico and in Santiago de Cuba province, Cuba. According to CMI estimates, the risk levels associated with SLR for human settlements analyzed in Mexico and Cuba were 5.3% and 11.0%, respectively. The most severely affected communities will require resettlement. Meanwhile, the CMI determined that 15.8% of the Mexican territory studied will be able to withstand the effects of SLR through the management of engineering works that will protect human settlements.

Lastly, the method used allowed for creation of a CMI stoplight map useful to coastal decision-makers to adopt sound management actions.

Potential Impacts of Extreme Heat and Bushfires on Dementia	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Review						Bushfire; climate change; dementia; extreme heat; wildfire	HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HUMAN HEALTH; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; AUSTRALIA; RISK; WAVE	Australia often experiences natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as: flooding, sandstorms, heatwaves, and bushfires (also known as wildfires or forest fires). The proportion of the Australian population aged 65 years and over is increasing, alongside the severity and frequency of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters. Extreme heat can affect the entire population but particularly at the extremes of life, and patients with morbidities. Frequently identified as a vulnerable demographic in natural disasters, there is limited research on older adults and their capacity to deal with extreme heat and bushfires. There is a considerable amount of literature that suggests a significant association between mental disorders such as dementia, and increased vulnerability to extreme heat. The prevalence rate for dementia is estimated at 30% by age 85 years, but there has been limited research on the effects extreme heat and bushfires have on individuals living with dementia. This review explores the differential diagnosis of dementia, the Australian climate, and the potential impact Australia's extreme heat and bushfires have on individuals from vulnerable communities including low socioeconomic status Indigenous and Non-Indigenous populations living with dementia, in both metropolitan and rural communities. Furthermore, we investigate possible prevention strategies and provide suggestions for future research on the topic of Australian bushfires and heatwaves and their impact on people living with dementia. This paper includes recommendations to ensure rural communities have access to appropriate support services, medical treatment, awareness, and information surrounding dementia.

This is due to different factors, among which climate change and land use stand out. In Mexico, they occur every year in different areas. Tabasco is a periodically flooded region, causing losses and negative consequences for the rural, urban, livestock, agricultural, and service industries. Consequently, it is necessary to create strategies to intervene effectively in the affected areas. Different strategies and techniques have been developed to mitigate the damage caused by this phenomenon. Satellite programs provide a large amount of data on the Earth's surface and geospatial information processing tools useful for environmental and forest monitoring, climate change impacts, risk analysis, and natural disasters. This paper presents a strategy for the classification of flooded areas using satellite images obtained from synthetic aperture radar, as well as the U-Net neural network and ArcGIS platform. The study area is located in Los Rios, a region of Tabasco, Mexico. The results show that U-Net performs well despite the limited number of training samples. As the training data and epochs increase, its precision increases.

However, there have been few quantitative studies on its feasibility. Furthermore, the differences in applicability depending on the topography and the construction of continuous levees have not been fully examined. We studied its feasibility based on simulations in the Kuji River area, where the vast Typhoon Hagibis occurred. Morphological models representing the past (the 1940s) and the present (2019), obtained by modifying the highly accurate digital elevation models (DEM) via the tracing of aerial photos, were applied to a 2D unsteady flow simulation model to reveal the effects of the levee system on river hydrography and overland flood behavior. The results indicated that inundation flow through an open area decreased both inundation duration and depth, while the reduction of peak discharge is relatively insignificant at approximately 10%. The sub levees are not adequate under the current conditions and floodwater volume, and their effectiveness depends on the surrounding conditions, such as the development of continuous levees.

WRF is forced with climate outputs from four Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the baseline period 1980-2005, and for 2041-2100 based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A quantile-quantile bias correction method and a regional frequency analysis were applied to acquire future grid-based IDF curves for the city of Edmonton. Future trends of air temperature and convective available potential energy (CAPE) are investigated. Future IDF curves are expected to have higher intensities because of projected higher air temperature and atmospheric water vapor, and projected increase in CAPE by 2071-2100. Our results likely mean that under the impact of climate change, the future risk of flooding in Edmonton would increase.

Within these systems, agriculture is one of the most potentially affected sectors. This paper proposes a risk assessment approach for helping the decision-making process at a local level, addressing two risks that affect agricultural areas located in estuarine margins: the unavailability of freshwater for irrigation resulting from the upstream propagation of estuarine brackish water during droughts and land inundation by high water levels associated with high tides and storm surges. For each risk, quantitative consequence descriptors are proposed to support risk level determination and evaluation through a continuous consequence-probability diagram. The approach applicability is discussed through its application to the Lezfria Grande de Vila Franca de Xira, located in the Tagus Estuary (Portugal). Results indicate that the approach is appropriate to support risk owners in taking actions to mitigate the risk. Examples of risk control measures for the risks addressed are presented. The main strengths of the proposed approach are its flexibility to be adapted to local conditions and updated through time, as well as the ease of its application by the risk owner.

Enhancing resilience is crucial, yet the comprehensive clustering of practical climate adaptation measures for use in construction industry decision-making is notably absent. This study investigates and categorizes various climate adaptation measures, justifying each through a lens of risk management, asset management, and previous scientific work. It takes advantage of the innovative digital platform Netobra, which offers an ecosystem for the construction industry, to provide real-world, practical implications of these measures. Informed by the Urban Resilience Evaluation System, ISO 31000 (risk management), and ISO 55000 (asset management), the study sets out to demonstrate the value of these measures in bolstering urban resilience and improving decision-making in the construction industry. Moreover, the study integrates a hotspot detection mechanism for areas at high risk of climate impacts, using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA)-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mapping on Netobra. These identified hotspots and corresponding climate adaptation measures will further be incorporated into a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) process, providing valuable insights for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban development. Through its in-depth analysis, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of how diverse climate adaptation measures can be practically applied in various sectors, thereby enhancing urban resilience and effective risk and asset management.

However, not only does it take up valuable development space, but the effectiveness of differing green infrastructure types in alleviating extreme rainfall impacts is unclear. This paper develops and tests scenarios linking various rainfall intensities (historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), types of green infrastructure (bio-retention cells, permeable pavement and rain gardens), and different spatial distributions (5 % and 10 % of the sub-catchment area) to investigate the extent to which green infrastructure can most effectively minimise flood risks while providing targeted equity benefits. Findings indicate that the implementation of 10 % of green infrastructure could reduce runoff peak rate and total runoff volume around 50-75 % at the sub-catchment scale. The paper provides two contributions. First, we develop and test a methodological approach that is able to link green infrastructure to climate and spatial futures. Second, we demonstrate which types of green infrastructure, and in which combinations, can most effectively reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Findings suggest that the strategic implementation of small green infrastructure areas can be hugely effective, particularly if multiple measures are combined.

While mechanisms and impacts of climatic stressors (e.g. frost, drought, heat or flooding) have been studied individually, little is known their combined impacts on crops to be expected under actual production conditions. This lack of process knowledge is reflected in the few instances of crop models considering multiple stressors. Here we provide an overview of the repre-sentation of single stressors in process based crop models. From this basis, a framework to consider multiple stressors in current models is presented, defining four stressor combination types: 1. Single exposure; 2. No direct interaction; 3. Known interaction; and 4. Unknown interaction. An analytical framework from ecological sciences is then presented as an approach to consider when formulating algorithms for the 4th type of unknown in-teractions. In a final section, we discuss new data driven and model based exploration options to support un-derstanding multiple stressor interactions in recognition of the challenges of experimentation around multiple stressors. We assert that process based modeling has a large and largely untapped potential to support scientific investigations of the underlying mechanisms driving crop response to multiple stressors.

The results showed that the average annual temperature and precipitation in Anhui Province showed a significant increasing trend during 1961-2020, with warming and humidification. 1994 was the year of abrupt climate change in Anhui Province, and the temperature after the abrupt change was 2.10 times that before the abrupt change. ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) has a synchronized resonance cycle with droughts and floods in Anhui Province at 5.8 a. The annual scale of ENSO events is an important theoretical support for regional drought and flood warnings. The chance of drought and flooding in Anhui Province is greater than 50% in the year of ENSO event or two years after the event, and the year of ENSO event or the year after is prone to drought and flooding, so we should strengthen the flood and drought warning, disaster prevention and mitigation.

Both climate change and human activities in recent periods along with pond system operation accelerated riverine channel morphology. A GIS-based approach using multi-temporal Landsat images (1986-2020) was employed to characterize the morphometric parameters. Results showed that width of the study reaches varied from 2.1 to 12 km. The braiding index (BI) value for Guddu reach varied from 3.47 to 7.18, and BI value for Sukkur reach varied from 2.11 to 4.92. It is observed that no erosive activity of banks occurred for peak runoff value of <5,880 m(3)s(-1). The sediment load during low flow (LF) period was estimated to be 0.715 million tons/day which comprised 77% fine sediment and 23% sand. The sediment load during high flood (HF) period was about 1.296 million tons/day. The median size (D-50) of bed material during the HF period was 0.101-0.206 mm and during LF period was . The rough set theory (RST) showed that velocity, shear stress, slope, runoff, and sediment load factors are majorly causing the river shape changes. This study is a standpoint of planning flood recovery, riverine regulations, and navigation safety.

Among some communities, rainfall induced flooding can cause increased uncertainty where first-mile transportation infrastructure is limited. In Rwanda, this challenge is apparent, where 90% of the population below the poverty line live in rural areas that are typically mountainous with frequent flooding - events that may be increasing in frequency and severity as the climate changes. To reduce these transportation barriers, the non-profit organization Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) plans to construct hundreds of trailbridges in Rwanda between 2018 and 2023. This scale of rural infrastructure services presents an opportunity for experimental investigation of the effects of these new trailbridges on economic, health, agricultural and education outcomes in rural communities. In this paper, we present a cohort study evaluating the potential community benefits of rural trailbridges - induding economic, health and social outcomes for Rwandan communities experiencing environmental change. We examined households living near 12 trailbridge sites and 12 comparison sites over February 2019-March 2020. We found that labor market income increased by 25% attributable to the trailbridges. We did not observe any significant effects on agricultural income, education or health outcomes, however given the small sample and short duration of this study we anticipate observing additional outcomes within the recently started 200 site, 4 year trial.

J	Contreras, MT; Gironás, J; Escauriaza, C				Teresa Contreras, Maria; Gironas, Jorge; Escauriaza, Cristian			Forecasting flood hazards in real time: a surrogate model for hydrometeorological events in an Andean watershed	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURGE; DEBRIS; CHILE; RISK	Growing urban development, combined with the influence of El Nino and climate change, has increased the threat of large unprecedented floods induced by extreme precipitation in populated areas near mountain regions of South America. High-fidelity numerical models with physically based formulations can now predict inundations with a substantial level of detail for these regions, incorporating the complex morphology, and copying with insufficient data and the uncertainty posed by the variability of sediment concentrations. These simulations, however, typically have large computational costs, especially if there are multiple scenarios to deal with the uncertainty associated with weather forecast and unknown conditions. In this investigation we develop a surrogate model or meta-model to provide a rapid response flood prediction to extreme hydrometeorological events. Storms are characterized with a small set of parameters, and a high-fidelity model is used to create a database of flood propagation under different conditions. We use kriging to perform an interpolation and regression on the parameter space that characterize real events, efficiently approximating the flow depths in the urban area. This is the first application of a surrogate model in the Andes region. It represents a powerful tool to improve the prediction of flood hazards in real time, employing low computational resources. Thus, future advancements can focus on using and improving these models to develop early warning systems that help decision makers, managers, and city planners in mountain regions.

The seedlings were grown in greenhouses for ambient CO2 (400 ppm) and in enclosed CO2-controlled chambers, which were installed inside the greenhouses for elevated CO2 (800 ppm). The tidal flooding duration was set-up according to the species distribution in the intertidal zone in New Caledonia for the controlled treatment and was increased by 1 h 45min for the experimental treatment. A total of 400 A. marina and 720 R. stylosa were monitored during this experiment. We measured heights and basal diameters of all seedlings every 90 days, and we determined the above and below ground biomass at the end of the experiment. Our results showed that elevated CO2 increased the growth rates of both A. marina and R. stylosa, for which the final biomass was, respectively, 46 and 32% higher than in the ambient CO2 treatment. We suggest that this increase was driven by a stimulation of photosynthesis under elevated CO2, as demonstrated in a previous study. Considering the tidal flooding duration treatment, we observed a contrasted effect between the species. Longer tidal flooding increased the growth of A. marina, whereas it reduced the growth of R. stylosa in comparison to the controlled treatment. This result may be related to the specific ecosystem zonation in this semi-arid climate, which limits water inputs into the Avicennia zone that increases the salt concentration in the soil, whereas Rhizophora is regularly submerged by tides due to its lower position in the intertidal zone. As a result, the combination of both treatments had a positive cumulative effect on the growth of A. marina. Although it was not the case for R. stylosa, the negative effect of longer tidal flooding on this species did not suppress the enhancement of growth resulting from elevated CO2 concentrations. At the end of the experiment, elevated CO2 increased the C:Nratios of the seedlings, thereby producing a more refractory organic matter, which will potentially result in lower decomposition rates and thus may increase carbon accumulation in mangrove soils. These results suggest that future climate changes may enhance the productivity of mangrove seedlings by increasing their growth, which may in turn increase the carbon storage potential of mangroves in their biomass.

J	Middleton, BA; Boudell, J				Middleton, Beth A.; Boudell, Jere			Salinification of Coastal Wetlands and Freshwater Management to Support Resilience	ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; MANGROVE FORESTS; RECYCLED WATER; RESTORATION; SUBSIDENCE; STREAMFLOW; IMPACTS; CONSERVATION	Climates are rapidly changing in wetland ecosystems around the world and historical land-use change is not always given enough consideration in climate adaptation discussions. Historical changes to hydrology and other key environments can exacerbate vegetation stress; e.g., recent drought and flood episodes are likely more extreme because of climate change. The contributions of global and regional changes that affect groundwater and surface water availability all need consideration in conservation planning including sea-level rise, coastal subsidence and compaction, fluid extraction, and floodplain reengineering. Where subsidence is not too extreme, healthy coastal vegetation often can keep ahead of sea-level rise by accreting elevation through sedimentary and/or biogenic processes. Better water conservation and minimum water delivery during drought may support foundational species and avoid wetland collapse. Local approaches have been developed to rewet inland floodplains decades after their reengineering for agricultural and urban development to support biodiversity in salinified coastal wetlands. The purpose of this paper is to describe inland wetland remediation techniques that may also be useful to increase freshwater delivery to coastal wetlands experiencing salinification. While some salinified coastal ecosystems may transition in the future, attempts can be made to remediate salinification related to historical land use in support of wetland conservation, health, and sustainability.

J	Godara, N; Bruland, O; Alfredsen, K				Godara, Nitesh; Bruland, Oddbjorn; Alfredsen, Knut			Simulation of flash flood peaks in a small and steep catchment using rain-on-grid technique	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hydrological modelling; rainfall-runoff modeling; TELEMAC-2D; hydraulic modelling; climate change adaption	RISK; MODEL; HYDROLOGY; SURFACE	The frequency of extreme events is increasing as the consequences of climate change. In steep terrains, flash floods with high-flow velocities induce erosion and sedimentation with potentially disastrous changes of flood path. Hence, the analysis of flash floods in steep terrains in terms of inundation area and flow-velocity to identify critical points becomes more important. The output of a flood simulation with a traditional hydrologic model provides the flood hydrograph which must be combined with a hydraulic model for downstream consequences. In small and steep catchments, the inflow contribution from every section of the water course can be important to determine where critical conditions may arise. In this study, rain-on-grid technique in the hydraulic model Telemac-2D is used to simulate flash-flood peaks with spatially distributed precipitation as input in a small and steep catchment in western Norway. Seven events were simulated and sensitivity tests on parameters were conducted. A 200-year design flood was simulated to show the potential consequences in the catchment. The results show that calibrated models can satisfactorily reproduce peak flows and produce relevant information about water velocities and inundation which decision makers can use for mitigation measures. The paper explores the benefits and limitations through a description of model construction, calibration, and test of sensitivities.

There remain however uncertainties regarding the patterns of change in past and future precipitation in the countries of West Africa. There are still too few studies focus on the individual perceptions of populations in Africa on these climate changes, although this is an essential lever for the implementation of warning systems. The aim of present study is to consider in parallel the perceptions of the residents of the city of Abidjan re-garding the variability of precipitation and the meteorological data. A survey among 503 individ-uals was carried out at Abidjan in two districts with contrasted topographical profiles, socio-economic conditions and exposure to flooding, in order to record their perceptions regarding the variations in precipitation between 2009 and 2018. The CHIRPS precipitation data was used to calculate the trends in the climate indicators with the Mann-Kendall method. The results show that there is a similarity between the perception of individuals surveyed and an increasing trend in days of rainfall of more than 50 mm and intensity of precipitation.

It is important to quantify and effectively communicate flood hazards and exposure to inform the design and implementation of flood risk management strategies. Here we develop an integrated modeling framework to assess projected changes in regional riverine flood inundation risks. The framework samples climate model outputs to force a hydrologic model and generate streamflow projections. Together with a statistical and hydraulic model, we use the projected streamflow to map the uncertainty of flood inundation projections for extreme flood events. We implement the framework for rivers across the state of Pennsylvania, United States. Our projections suggest that flood hazards and exposure across Pennsylvania are overall increasing with future climate change. Specific regions, including the main stem Susquehanna River, lower portion of the Allegheny basin, and central portion of Delaware River basin, demonstrate higher flood inundation risks. In our analysis, the climate uncertainty dominates the overall uncertainty surrounding the flood inundation projection chain. The combined hydrologic and hydraulic uncertainties can account for as much as 37% of the total uncertainty. We discuss how this framework can provide regional and dynamic flood-risk assessments and help to inform the design of risk-management strategies.

Ecosystems provide multiple services, such as food production, water supply, biodiversity conservation, carbon fixation, air quality improvement, and other services. Therefore, they have the potential to mitigate the destructive effects of extreme weather events. Ecosystems with high service values are thought to be able to alleviate the intensity of dryness/wetness. Although this issue has gained increasing attention, the quantitative relationship between ecosystem services and the intensity of weather extremes is still unknown. The aim of this study is quantifying such relationship and the contribution of ecosystem services and their components to the reduction in weather intensities. Spearman's correlations analysis, a redundancy analysis, and variation partitioning based on three datasets for China and at the global scale were employed. The results indicated that ecosystem services generally decrease the intensity of dryness/wetness extremes, and these effects vary across climate types and ecosystem service components. Therefore, if it is possible to increase ecosystem service values, the intensity of dryness/wetness extremes at the local, regional and global scales can be reasonably alleviated.

The present study aims to assess the biomass and soil carbon (C) stock in the hydroelectric catchment in India and further, its implications to mitigate GHG emissions. The estimation depicts the low 'C' stock in the reservoir's catchment in comparison to reservoirs located globally in the same eco-region which will ultimately result in lower GHG emission in the future. Moreover, estimated total carbon density of the forest species was found as 54.92 +/- 18.07 MgC.ha(-1) while mean SOC was 79.64 +/- 19.32 MgC.ha(-1). The average total 'C' stock of Tehri hydroelectric reservoir's catchment was estimated as 134.56 MgC.ha(-1). Moreover, ratios (total flooded carbon/installed capacity) comprised between 4 and304 kgC/W from the other reservoirs reported globally. These ratios are higher than the Tehri reservoir (0.28 kgC/W) as flooded area of Tehri reservoir during impoundment was 52 km(2). Thus, Tehri reservoir was found to emit less GHG in time to come. The present study helps the hydropower industries, policymakers, and environmentalists in designing the catchment area treatment plan to minimize the negative impact of GHG on climate change.

However, climatic perturbations in the region have imposed severe threat to their survival, status in wild and production of bioactive metabolites. Changes in climatic conditions include variation in different abiotic (light, water, temperature) and biotic (weed, pathogen) factors, which are known to play a key role in plant growth and development. Increased global temperature, erratic monsoon, recurrent drought/flooding events, increased insect-pest attacks, etc., have negatively affected the phenology, morpho-physiological and biochemical responses of plants. However, to date, a collective record on the occurrence of various environmental stresses in the medicinal plants is not available. Thus, this review provides comprehensive and updated information on this topic to facilitate thorough understanding of response of Himalayan plants to different stress factors. This will help in adapting potential disease management strategies, identifying resilient accessions and optimum environmental conditions for plant growth and metabolite production. Further, the review will provide valuable insight to conservation biologists, plant pathologists, plant breeders and biotechnologists about current disease and stress trends in Himalayan medicinal plants, so that location specific management practices can be adopted and/or standardized.

Objective of this study is to examine Indus River current tendency of shifting course with raising outcomes of floods and riverbank erosion and its impact on livelihood of Bait and riverbank areas community in Pakistan. Secondary and primary date were applied in the study while primary data of 380 households collected from Bait and riverbank area. Satellite images from 2000 to 2022 were used for analysis procedure which pictured as Indus River course continuing to shifting eastern side and eroding villages in succession. Empirical estimates indicated as inhabited households are confronted with multidimensional obstructions to sustaining their livelihood in native area. Frequent land losses due to riverbank erosion enforce each year majority of households to displace from their native areas. Resettlement issues and inadequate public support, disaster mitigation mechanism becomes unfeasible to get better from dreadful circumstances of susceptible inhabited population. Construction of embankment, criss-cross embankment pillars, sandbags and boulder pitching are some State-based significant policy measures to protect inhabited population from forthcoming floods and riverbank collapses. Outcomes of such government protective measures remained unsatisfied due to inappropriate implementation of such strategies. State-based central and local authorities must manage appropriate rehabilitation measures and its fast track implementation to maintain livelihood sustainability of riverbank erosion and flood prone inhabitant households.

Nonetheless, biodiversity inventories of soil mesofauna are scarce in afro-tropical ecosystems, even in emblematic and well-studied protected areas, such as the Gorongosa National Park (GNP). Understanding the interrelationships between tree canopies and soil fauna functional diversity can provide insightful information for future adaptive management to protect wildlife and ecosystem services in the GNP, in the context of climate change. Here we assessed collembolan functional type richness and functional diversity in the dry period and during the rainfall across major GNP habitat types: miombo forests, mixed forests, and open savanna/floodplains. Besides the significant positive influence of rainfall, habitat types also influenced functional type' richness and diversity of collembolan life-forms. Environmental gradients across habitat types, namely the area of tree canopy cover and its indirect effect on soil local conditions (pH and nutrient availability), explained collembolan functional parameters. Calcium concentrations and soil alkalinity significantly enhanced collembolan functional type richness and functional diversity, respectively. Collembola survival across GNP habitats depended on the canopy buffering in the dry sampling period. These results highlight the key role of tree canopies in creating suitable microhabitat conditions supporting soil functional diversity and the sustainability of soil processes and ecosystem services in GNP.

Global warming facilitates the nesting of the loggerhead turtle on the Mediterranean coast of Spain	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Caretta caretta; feminization; marine turtles; migration; philopatry; global warming; climate change; temperature	THERMAL-REACTION NORM; CARETTA-CARETTA; SEA-TURTLE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; MARINE TURTLES; SITE SELECTION; GROWTH-RATE; TEMPERATURE; RATIO	The ranges of many species are shifting poleward as global warming intensifies, but this process might be less intense in philopatric species, i.e. those with the tendency to reproduce at their natal sites. Marine turtles are highly philopatric and their vulnerability to global warming is exacerbated by a life history combining delayed sexual maturity, temperature-dependent sex determination and low embryo survival at high incubation temperature. Detection of nesting events of loggerhead turtles in the Western Mediterranean Sea has increased largely during the first two decades of the 21st century, which could be a response to global warming or the result of increased sampling effort. The deployment of temperature data loggers at 52 beaches scattered along the Mediterranean coast of Spain demonstrated that sand temperature is currently high enough to allow the incubation of loggerhead turtles clutches in most Spanish beaches. However, the reconstruction of sand temperature from 1950 to 2019 revealed that thermal conditions suitable for the regular nesting of loggerhead turtles have existed in Spanish beaches only since 2010, although sporadic nesting was possible previously in exceptionally warm years. The future establishment of a self-sustained population would probably require further increases in temperature, to ensure a female-biased offspring production, but the process might be jeopardized by increased erosion and beach flooding resulting from sea level rise.

In this study, the daily precipitation concentration index in the Yangtze River Delta in China is calculated based on the Lorenz curves obtained from the observed data of 36 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2017, and spatiotemporal pattern variations and their possible causes are investigated. The driving forces of elevation, SUNSPOT, El Nino-Antarctic Oscillation, Pacific Decade Oscillation, and Arctic Oscillation are detected with correlation and wavelet analysis. Results show that, the daily precipitation concentration index ranges from 0.55 to 0.62 during the study period, 22 of 36 stations (accounting for 61%) show increasing trends, while three stations increase significantly at the 95% significant level. Relationship analysis indicates that the daily precipitation concentration shows a slightly negative correlation with elevation, while the relationships with SUNSPOT, El Nino-Antarctic Oscillation, Pacific Decade Oscillation, and Arctic Oscillation are complicated and diverse, there are different correlations and significance levels in different years. Further analysis shows that SUNSPOT is significantly correlated with El Nino-Antarctic Oscillation, Pacific Decade Oscillation, and Arctic Oscillation, which suggests that SUNSPOT may be an important factor that drives the changes of the three large-scale atmosphere circulation factors and causes precipitation concentration changing indirectly. These results provide further understandings of precipitation variations, which are meaningful for regional flood risk management under climate change.

J	Li, ZH; Song, KY; Peng, L				Li, Zhihui; Song, Keyu; Peng, Lu			Flood Risk Assessment under Land Use and Climate Change in Wuhan City of the Yangtze River Basin, China	LAND			English	Article						flood risk; land use change; climate change; analytic hierarchy process; Wuhan city	URBAN; IMPACTS; HAZARD	Frequently occurring flood disasters caused by extreme climate and urbanization processes have become the most common natural hazard and pose a great threat to human society. Therefore, urban flood risk assessment is of great significance for disaster mitigation and prevention. In this paper, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal variations in flood risk in Wuhan during 2000-2018. A comprehensive flood risk assessment index system was constructed from the hazard, sensitivity, and vulnerability components with seven indices. The results showed that the central urban area, especially the area in the west bank of the Yangtze river, had high risk due to its high flood sensitivity that was determined by land use type and high vulnerability with dense population and per unit GDP. Specifically, the Jianghan, Qiaokou, Jiangan, and Wuchang districts had the highest flood risk, more than 60% of whose area was in medium or above-medium risk regions. During 2000-2018, the flood risk overall showed an increasing trend, with Hongshan district increasing the most, and the year of 2010 was identified as a turning point for rapid risk increase. In addition, the comparison between the risk maps and actual historical inundation point records showed good agreement, indicating that the assessment framework and method proposed in this study can be useful to assist flood mitigation and management, and relevant policy recommendations were proposed based on the assessment results.

This work contributes to designing a planned and feasible urban rain flood ecosystem to promote the construction of a sponge city. It has various advantages of improving the water environment, controlling urban waterlogging, reducing runoff pollution, improving river and lake water quality, recycling rainwater resources, replenishing groundwater, and many more. This paper combines the design methods and advantages of the design results formed in decades using traditional regulation and utilizing it for the present study. It reconstructs and integrates the traditional regulation and sponge city construction requirements, thereby providing a feasible urban rain-flood ecosystem in the industrial and smart city scenario. Finally, the regulation of new paddy areas in Yanjin city of China is considered for experimentation, and the design of the regulation is applied using this setup. The design results obtained from the test of sponge city construction have operability and can improve the urban environment and enhance the vitality of the city. The control plan's design results integrating the sponge city idea can provide effective technical support and guarantee the overall urban environment. The work presented in this article can assess and plan the flood mitigation measures to monitor this type of situation leading to flooding risk reduction in smart cities.

J	Osberghaus, D; Demski, C				Osberghaus, Daniel; Demski, Christina			The causal effect of flood experience on climate engagement: evidence from search requests for green electricity	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; RISK; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; RESPONSES; GERMANY; IMPACTS; PEOPLE	It has been postulated that personal experience of climate change-related weather events may reduce the psychological distance to climate change and trigger engagement in climate protection measures. We use a novel longitudinal dataset on revealed household behaviour and insured damage data to re-examine this relationship, which has mostly been studied by cross-sectional and self-reported data. Using a difference-in-differences estimator, we assess the causal effect of experiencing financial damage from the 2013 floods in Germany on the interest for renewable energy tariffs in online power portals, which we take as a proxy for engagement in climate protection. The results broadly confirm the expected positive effect of flood experience on climate engagement, but there are important non-linear effects. Most notably, the effect drops to zero if damage is very high meaning the causal effect of flood experience on interest in green energy holds only for moderately affected regions. One explanation for this inverted U-shaped effect is that high flood damage may constrain the available budget for costly climate protection, due to high recovery and reconstruction costs. We also suggest a number of psychological mechanisms that may play a role in explaining this non-linear effect, for example non-protective responses such as denial and fatalism if damage is high. When supporting private climate engagement, policymakers should not rely on a motivating effect of damage experience, but should acknowledge the economic and psychological limitations, especially of severely flood-affected households.

Global and regional impacts of climate change at different levels of global temperature increase	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							DEGREES-C; VARIABILITY; YIELDS	The assessment of the impacts of climate change at different levels of global warming helps inform national and international policy discussion around mitigation targets. This paper provides consistent estimates of global and regional impacts and risks at increases in global mean temperature up to 5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, for over 30 indicators representing temperature extremes and heatwaves, hydrological change, floods and droughts and proxies for impacts on crop yields. At the global scale, all the impacts that could plausibly be either adverse or beneficial are adverse, and impacts and risks increase with temperature change. For example, the global average chance of a major heatwave increases from 5% in 1981-2010 to 28% at 1.5 degrees C and 92% at 4 degrees C, of an agricultural drought increases from 9 to 24% at 1.5 degrees C and 61% at 4 degrees C, and of the 50-year return period river flood increases from 2 to 2.4% at 1.5 degrees C and 5.4% at 4 degrees C. The chance of a damaging hot spell for maize increases from 5 to 50% at 4 degrees C, whilst the chance for rice rises from 27 to 46%. There is considerable uncertainty around these central estimates, and impacts and risks vary between regions. Some impacts-for example heatwaves-increase rapidly as temperature increases, whilst others show more linear responses. The paper presents estimates of the risk of impacts exceeding specific targets and demonstrates that these estimates are sensitive to the thresholds used.	[Arnell, N.

Intensification of precipitation extremes in the world's humid and water-limited regions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						precipitation; extremes; humid regions; arid regions; climate change; observations; CMIP5	FUTURE CHANGES; CMIP5; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; INDEXES; DRY	Changes in precipitation totals and extremes are among the most relevant consequences of climate change, but in particular regional changes remain uncertain. While aggregating over larger regions reduces the noise in time series and typically shows increases in the intensity of precipitation extremes, it has been argued that this may not be the case in water-limited regions. Here we investigate long-term changes in annual precipitation totals and extremes aggregated over the world's humid, transitional, and dry regions as defined by their climatological water availability. We use the globally most complete observational datasets suitable for the analysis of daily precipitation extremes, and data from global climate model simulations. We show that precipitation totals and extremes have increased in the humid regions since the mid-20th century. Conversely, despite showing tendencies to increase, no robust changes can be detected in the drier regions, in part due to the large variability of precipitation and sparse observational coverage particularly in the driest regions. Future climate simulations under increased radiative forcing indicate total precipitation increases in more humid regions but no clear changes in the more arid regions, while precipitation extremes are more likely to increase than to decrease on average over both the humid and arid regions of the world. These results highlight the increasing risk of heavy precipitation in most regions of the world, including water-limited regions, with implications for related impacts through flooding risk or soil erosion.

To obtain the most accurate reconstructions, a thorough understanding of the geomorphic evolution of such lake basins must be grounded in field stratigraphy and mapping, which are often lacking or are not well integrated with core studies. We conducted extensive stratigraphic investigation, mapping, and dating of exposed strata in the Lake Manix basin, former terminus of the Mojave River, California, during the Pleistocene to provide such a background and to supplement interpretations from a 45-m-long core. In this paper, we emphasize the geomorphic and tectonic processes that shaped the evolution of the Manix basin after the arrival of the Mojave River in the early-middle Pleistocene. The main processes include (1) sedimentary infilling of the lake basin, (2) interaction among the subbasins as controlled by internal sills and sill failures, (3) tectonics, and (4) climate change. From about 500 to 190 ka, Lake Manix was confined to its western subbasins, and fluctuated in response to climate change and perhaps to brief diversions of the river into the upstream Harper Lake basin. During this time, about 24 m of sediment accumulated near the confluence of the Mojave River and Manix Wash, and a 15-km-long clastic wedge built into the western basins, gradually filling the accommodation space. Two basin-integration events subsequently occurred, both caused by failure of sills that lay on sheared deposits along the Manix fault zone. When Lake Manix rose at the onset of glacial marine isotope stage 6, the sill on the south flank of Buwalda Ridge failed and triggered a catastrophic flood that entered the new, lower elevation, previously endorheic Afton subbasin. Subsequent lake-level changes affected both subbasins, but the thickest deposits after the flood are preserved in the Afton subbasin. The area upstream of Buwalda Ridge was only submerged during relatively high lake levels. Thus, sediment records interpreted from the core site and nearby outcrops in part reflect a geomorphic event (basin integration) rather than climatic conditions. The sill of Lake Manix after the integration event lay at the northeast end of the Afton subbasin, athwart strands of the Manix fault zone. At about 25 ka, this eastern sill was rapidly incised, and the river advanced to terminate in Lake Mojave in the Soda and Silver Lake basins. Recognition and dating of integration events, common for lake-river interactions in active tectonic settings, provide important context for interpreting paleoclimate records from sediments and provide temporal and spatial constraints on the biogeography of aquatic species.

Adaptation to Natural Disasters through the Agricultural Land Rental Market: Evidence from Bangladesh	LAND ECONOMICS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; LABOR-MARKETS; INCOME; IMPACTS; CHOICE; FLOOD; TRANSITION; DECISIONS; HAZARDS; ENTRY	We examine the effects of natu-ral disasters on agricultural households that make rent -in or rent -out transactions. Our econometric approach accounts for the effects of disaster exposure on the adjustments in the quantity of operated land and agricultural income conditional on the land quantity ad-justments. Using a household survey data set from Bangladesh, we find that farmers were able to partially ameliorate their losses from exposure to disasters by optimizing their op-erational farm size through these land rental transactions. Land rental market may be an effective instrument in reducing disaster risks, and postdisaster policies should consider this role more systematically. (JEL Q24, Q54)	[Eskander, Shaikh M. S.

Spain is one of the countries in Europe expected to suffer the most from the consequences of climate change, notably an increase in flooding. The authors selected the Mino River basin in the northwest of Spain, which covers an area of 2,168 km2, to develop a novel approach for predicting streamflow in ungauged basins. This study presents a regionalisation of the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), a semi-distributed, physically based hydrological model. The regionalisation approach transfers SWAT model parameters based on hydrological similarities between gauged and ungauged subbasins. The authors used k-means and expectation-maximisation (EM) machine learning clustering techniques to group 30 subbasins (9 gauged subbasins) into homogeneous, physical, similarity-based clusters. Furthermore, the regionalisation featured physiographic attributes (basin area, elevation, and channel length and slope) and climatic information (precipitation and temperature) for each subbasin. For each homogeneous group, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated for the gauged basins (donor basins), and the calibrated parameters were transferred to the pseudo-ungauged basins (receptor basins) for streamflow prediction. The results of the streamflow prediction in the pseudo-ungauged basins demonstrate satisfactory performance in most of the cases, with average NSE, R2, RSR, and RMSE values of 0.78, 0.91, 0.42, and 5.10 m3/s, respectively. The results contribute to water planning and management and flood estimation in the studied region and similar areas.

In 2022, a summer marine heatwave (MHW) affected the entire Mediterranean Sea, and temperatures up to 5 degrees C above seasonal mean were reached in the Ligurian Sea in the NW part of the Mediterranean basin. In this scenario, the waters of the Port of Genoa (at the northern apex of the Ligurian Sea) distinguished themselves by maintaining lower temperatures than those of the open sea (a maximum gradient of -6.1 degrees C on 9 August 2022) after the passage of a fast-moving storm. In this study, the weather and sea parameters of the period (June-December 2022) are analysed to determine the phenomenon that caused the drop in temperatures in the water masses of the Port of Genoa. The sudden cooling of the water masses inside the port was caused by a heavy rainfall event in early August. Moreover, the isolation of the port water masses due to the weak dynamics of the period kept them stationary and locked inside the port. Seawater temperatures inside the port slowly rose again after the event, remaining cooler than outside temperatures throughout August (-0.3 degrees C on 31 August), reaching and exceeding outside temperatures on 3 September (26.4 degrees C), and remaining warmer until 3 November 2022 (21.5 degrees C).

Seawater flooding can lead to the salinization of fresh coastal aquifers by vertical saltwater intrusion (SWI). Vertical SWI is often overlooked in coastal zone threat assessments despite the risk it poses to critical freshwater resources and salt-intolerant ecosystems that sustain coastal populations. This review synthesizes field and modeling approaches for investigating vertical SWI and the practical and theoretical understanding of salinization and flushing processes obtained from prior studies. The synthesis explores complex vertical SWI dynamics that are influenced by density-dependent flow and oceanic, hydrologic, geologic, climatic, and anthropogenic forcings acting on coastal aquifers across spatial and temporal scales. Key knowledge gaps, management challenges, and research opportunities are identified to help advance our understanding of the vulnerability of fresh coastal groundwater. Past modeling studies often focus on idealized aquifer systems, and thus future work could consider more diverse geologic, climatic, and topographic environments. Concurrent field and modeling programs should be sustained over time to capture interactions between physical processes, repeated salinization and flushing events, and delayed aquifer responses. Finally, this review highlights the need for improved coordination and knowledge translation across disciplines (e.g., coastal engineering, hydrogeology, oceanography, social science) to gain a more holistic understanding of vertical SWI. There also needs to be more education of communities, policy makers, and managers to motivate societal action to address coastal groundwater vulnerability in a changing climate.

The Importance of Storm Surge for Sediment Delivery to Microtidal Marshes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						salt marsh; tidal flat; storm surge; sediment transport; climate change; modeling	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT-MARSH; LONG-TERM; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONES; COASTAL WETLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIDAL FLATS; VEGETATION; BAY; DEPOSITION	Storm surge has the potential to significantly increase suspended sediment flux to microtidal marshes. However, the overall effects of storm surge on microtidal marsh deposition have not been well quantified, with most modeling studies focusing on regular (astronomical) tidal flooding. Here we applied the Delft3D model to a microtidal bay-marsh complex in Hog Bay, Virginia to quantify the contributions of storm surge to marsh deposition. We validated the model using spatially distributed hydrodynamic and suspended sediment data collected from the site and ran model simulations under different storm surge conditions with/without storm-driven water level changes. Our results show that episodic storm surge events occurred 5% of the time at our study site, but contributed 40% of marsh deposition during 2009-2020. Our simulations illustrate that while wind-driven waves control sediment resuspension on tidal flats, marsh deposition during storms was largely determined by tidal inundation associated with storm-driven water levels. A moderate storm surge event can double sediment flux to most marshes around the bay and deliver more sediment to the marsh interior compared to simulations that include wind waves but not storm surge variations in water levels. Simulations of bay and marsh response to different storm surge events with varying magnitude of storm surge intensity reveal that total marsh deposition around the bay increased linearly with storm surge intensity, suggesting that future changes to storm magnitude and/or frequency would have significant implications for sediment supply to marshes at our study site.

Besides coastal floods, the Mediterranean region is highly prone to flash floods driven by short but intense precipitation events. With increasing flood risk due to climate change and socio-economic conditions, governments are under pressure to reinforce flood protection measures, which could be a great challenge for the weak economies of non-EU developing countries. This is of particular relevance to achieving international commitments such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Several policy frameworks have been developed to mitigate flooding risk, at European Union (EU) and global level. These frameworks call for a holistic risk reduction approach where governments, institutions, and households are all responsible for reducing risk. In practice, however, gray infrastructure remains the prevailing flood risk management measure in many countries. Incorporation into national legislation and implementation of the EU policy framework will increase constraints and pressures for non-EU countries, particularly those strongly committed to becoming EU members in future. This article provides a comprehensive review of policies and measures implemented in four different southern European countries to mitigate flood hazard, and compares governance aspects between EU (Portugal and Slovenia) and non-EU countries (B&H and Serbia). Understanding governance aspects and the status of flood-related policy implementation is of critical importance in protecting people and enhancing resilience to climate change impacts. Programs of improvement measures and further integration of sustainable water management with other sectoral policies are required to reduce flood risks.

This paper describes a laboratory study of the geomorphic adjustment of a braided river to sequences of floods across five different strengths of braidplain vegetation. By using alfalfa as a proxy for braidplain vegetation, the differing plant life stages were used to represent the varying strengths of biogeomorphic feedbacks across the floods. Boundary conditions were constrained by sets of experimental runs with both equilibrium sediment loads and deficit loads. Changes in bed topography were monitored and assessed using a detailed digital elevation model, digital imagery and continuous monitoring of the transported sediment. Results demonstrate that in absence of plant colonization, vegetation placed the rivers in a non-equilibrium condition, in which riparian vegetation encouraged the development of new channels, increased the system channel width and enhanced topographic irregularity, these effects being more noticeable during the low-flow periods. The morphodynamics was found to be less sensitive to variations in flood discharges as the vegetation influence (strength) increased from minimum to maximum, until vegetation began to die back and the impacts of flood sequences became yet again evident. Although the overall sediment transport rate was reduced under full-grown vegetation conditions, the presence of the mature plants across the braid bars resulted in the greatest channel scour depths. Results are considered in light of expected changes in flood frequency with climate and likely morphodynamic responses of river systems as a result.

The determination of key monitoring areas is an effective approach to prevent and control the spread of such species. The 10 most important weeds have been listed on a global scale. It is therefore crucial to delineate the areas with high monitoring ranks for the 10 most important weed species under climate change. We coupled conservation prioritization analysis with habitat suitability modelling to determine key monitoring areas for these species, based on different types and vulnerability levels of biomes under current and future (i.e., 2040-2069 and 2070-2099) scenarios. We determined some specific biomes (i.e., tropical and subtropical biomes, flooded grasslands and savannas, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub, and mangroves) as key monitoring areas for the 10 most important weed species under a changing climate. These biomes are distributed in most regions of Latin America, the United States, Europe, central and south Africa, south and southeast Asia, southeast Australia, and New Zealand, including large vulnerable ecoregions. Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands were particularly vulnerable, because these biomes had the largest area with a high monitoring rank, and this rank was predicted to further increase in the near future. Our study highlights the importance of effective management strategies for the prevention and control of these species across different biomes on a global scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other crops, rice is a main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to methane emissions from flooded paddy fields. Climate change can therefore be addressed in two ways in rice: through making the crop more climate resilient and through changes in management practices that reduce methane emissions and thereby slow global warming. In this review, we focus on two water saving technologies that reduce the periods lowland rice will be grown under fully flooded conditions, thereby improving water use efficiency and reducing methane emissions. Rice breeding over the past decades has mostly focused on developing high-yielding varieties adapted to continuously flooded conditions where seedlings were raised in a nursery and transplanted into a puddled flooded soil. Shifting cultivation to direct-seeded rice or to introducing non-flooded periods as in alternate wetting and drying gives rise to new challenges which need to be addressed in rice breeding. New adaptive traits such as rapid uniform germination even under anaerobic conditions, seedling vigor, weed competitiveness, root plasticity, and moderate drought tolerance need to be bred into the current elite germplasm and to what extent this is being addressed through trait discovery, marker-assisted selection and population improvement are reviewed.

The onset of these climate stressors cannot be predicted with certainty, but precautionary measures should be taken to reduce the exposure of people at risk. This study examined the extent to which early warning has been mainstreamed into development activities at the district level in the midst of climate stressors. The study employed a descriptive research design within the remit of qualitative approach. The data were obtained by conducting in-depth interviews complemented by document study. The study showed that the Information Services Department, National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) Zonal Coordinators, and radio played a major role in the dissemination of early warning communication in the districts. The study further found that the responsibility for issuing early warning messages varied across the districts, and training of staff engaged in early warning activities was limited. The study showed that there was no budget for early warning activities. Insufficient finances as well as logistics and equipment were the key challenges faced by the District NADMO offices in the region. The study recommended that the NADMO Offices should be adequately resourced financially and with working logistics and equipment to undertake their core functions. The necessary training should be offered to persons engaged in early warning and response systems in the respective districts.

Although the knowledge about stream-riparian interactions has increased considerably recently, in practice, riparian zones are still mainly seen as buffers for nutrient and sediment loading. However, recent research has shown that riparian forests disproportionately foster regional biodiversity and maintain stream ecosystem functions and diversity. On the other hand, streams contribute to riparian diversity and ecosystem functions. Microbes are key drivers of global biochemical cycles, and they also interact with plants and animals. The knowledge on microbial communities and understanding of processes they drive has considerably increased due to recent development in microbial profiling methods. However, microbes have been largely neglected in former reviews. Thus, this overview has a special focus on the role of microorganisms in controlling stream-riparian interaction. We also review the land-use pressures that are threatening biodiversity and ecosystem processes of riparian zones in forested landscapes. In addition, we review the possible effects of climate change on stream-riparian interactions. Finally, we outline the research gaps that call for future research.

Arctic sea ice export as a driver of deglacial climate	GEOLOGY			English	Article							GLACIAL LAKE AGASSIZ; YOUNGER DRYAS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; OCEAN; MELTWATER; THERMOHALINE; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; SHEET; CIRCULATION	A widespread theory in paleoclimatology suggests that changes in freshwater discharge to the Nordic (Greenland, Norwegian, and Icelandic) Seas from ice sheets and proglacial lakes over North America played a role in triggering episodes of abrupt climate change during deglaciation (21-8 ka) by slowing the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC). Yet, proving this link has been problematic, as climate models are unable to produce centennial-to-millennial-length reductions in overturning from short-lived outburst floods, while periods of iceberg discharge during Heinrich Event 1 (ca. 16 ka) may have occurred after the climate had already begun to cool. Here, results from a series of numerical model experiments are presented to show that prior to deglaciation, sea ice could have become tens of meters thick over large parts of the Arctic Basin, forming an enormous reservoir of freshwater independent from terrestrial sources. Our model then shows that deglacial sea-level rise, changes in atmospheric circulation, and terrestrial outburst floods caused this ice to be exported through Fram Strait, where its subsequent melt freshened the Nordic Seas enough to weaken the AMOC. Given that both the volume of ice stored in the Arctic Basin and the magnitude of the simulated export events exceed estimates of the volumes and fluxes of meltwater periodically discharged from proglacial Lake Agassiz, our results show that non-terrestrial freshwater sources played an important role in causing past abrupt climate change.

For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation.

The study first investigates the statistical methods applied to the land-based daily precipitation series acquired from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D). Additional analysis was carried out on the simulated Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA)-based downscaled daily extreme precipitation of 15 General Circulation Models and Weather Research and Forecasting-based hourly extreme precipitation of North American Regional Reanalysis to discern the return period of 24-hr and 48-hr events. We infer that the GHCN-D and MACA-based precipitation reveals increasing trends in annual and seasonal extreme daily precipitation. Both BCC-CSM1-1-m and GFDL-ESM2M models revealed that the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase between 2016 and 2099. We conclude that the future scenarios show an increase in magnitudes of extreme precipitation up to three times across southeastern Virginia resulting in increased discharge rates at selected gauge locations. The depth-duration-frequency curve predicted an increase of 2-3 times in 24- and 48-h precipitation intensity, higher peaks, and indicated an increase of up to 50% in flood magnitude in future scenarios.

J	Kumar, N; Patel, P; Singh, S; Goyal, MK				Kumar, Nikhil; Patel, Piyush; Singh, Shivam; Goyal, Manish Kumar			Understanding non-stationarity of hydroclimatic extremes and resilience in Peninsular catchments, India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GRIDDED RAINFALL DATA; MONSOON RAINFALL; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; OCEAN DIPOLE; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; OSCILLATION; STREAMFLOW; AMAZON; SHIFTS	Climate change significantly impacts the global hydrological cycle, leading to pronounced shifts in hydroclimatic extremes such as increased duration, occurrence, and intensity. Despite these significant changes, our understanding of hydroclimatic risks and hydrological resilience remains limited, particularly at the catchment scale in peninsular India. This study aims to address this gap by examining hydroclimatic extremes and resilience in 54 peninsular catchments from 1988 to 2011. We initially assess extreme precipitation and discharge indices and estimate design return levels using non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models that use global climate modes (ENSO, IOD, and AMO) as covariates. Further, hydrological resilience is evaluated using a convex model that inputs simulated discharge from the best hydrological model among SVM, RVM, random forest, and a conceptual model (abcd). Our analysis shows that the spatial patterns of mean extreme precipitation indices (R1 and R5) mostly resemble with extreme discharge indices (Q1 and Q5). Additionally, all extreme indices, including R1, Q1, R5, and Q5, demonstrate non-stationary behavior, indicating the substantial influence of global climate modes on extreme precipitation and flooding across the catchments. Our results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the others. Furthermore, we find that 68.52% of the catchments exhibit low to moderate hydrological resilience. Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding hydroclimatic risks and catchment resilience for accurate climate change impact predictions and effective adaptation strategies.

However, communities in the region are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards that have significant direct and indirect impacts on their livelihoods. To implement efficient risk management strategies, it is important to understand the interlinkages between the different dimensions and factors that influence livelihood security and resilience in such communities. Through a literature review and expert workshop, this paper studies the multi-hazard scenario and impacts in the LMB region and the interlinkages between livelihoods and resilience in the LMB communities. The paper consolidates these findings and proposes a localized assessment framework that can be used by stakeholders in decision-making process. Floods and droughts were identified as primary natural hazards, while a multi-hazard assessment highlighted a wide spatial variation in the hazard levels across the region. The primary impacts of such hazards are on the agricultural communities dependent on the basin's ecosystem and natural resources for their livelihoods. A holistic framework has been proposed to measure the multi-hazard livelihood security and resilience in LMB communities that can be used by government authorities and development partners in planning and implementing mitigation and preparedness activities to manage and reducing the risk of hazards.

In this study, a Bayesian Box-Cox transformation three-level factorial analysis (BBC-TFA) method is developed for revealing the influence of parameter uncertainty on the runoff in the Naryn River Basin. BBC-TFA can not only quantify the uncertainty through Bayesian inference but also investigate the individual and interactive effects of multiple parameters on model output. Main findings disclose that (i) the contribution rate of runoff potential parameter during the non-melting period reaches 88.22%, indicating a flood risk in the rainy season; (ii) the contribution rate of snow temperature lag factor is the highest during the snow-melting period and the entire year (respectively occupying 76.69 and 53.70%), indicating that the glacier melting exists in the Naryn River Basin throughout the year; (iii) the Box-Cox transformation can successfully remove residual variance and enhance the correlation between input and output variables. These findings serve to revealing the presence of glacial resources in the study basin and the significant runoff during the rainy season. Policymakers can consider water storage during the rainy season while developing glacier resources to alleviate water scarcity.

Yet, evidence on their economic benefits is scarce, especially since the provided environmental amenities usually spatially correlate with climate-induced hazards, effects of which NbS aim to curb. This lack of empirical evidence creates obscurity regarding social acceptability of NS, hindering their uptake and upscaling. We apply hedonic price models to estimate homeowners' willingness-to-pay for NbS (like flood safety, environmental benefits), while controlling for spatio-temporal changes in capitalized flood risk discounts due to the 1993-1995 floods in the Limburg Province, the Netherlands. We reveal a pre-flood effect of 5.6% (discounting on average-euro12,753 for flood-prone properties), which rises to 10.9% (-euro24,691 on average) immediately after the floods. However, the effect is only transitory. The flood discount of home values price discount diminishes over time and eventually vanishes in 9-12 years, which coincides with the implementation of the largest and oldest NbS intervention in the Netherlands. Our analysis shows that NbS amenities provide a 15% (euro33,687 on average) premium to nearby residential property prices. This evidence of the evolving flood risk discount and the stable NbS premium for individual homeowners could support the economic feasibility and wide acceptability of NbS for climate change adaptations.

Hence, to address the features and corresponding physical mechanisms of these rainstorms, we examined the rainstorm that occurred in Hotan, Xinjiang in June 2021 as a case study. We employed multiple datasets, including meteorological stations, sounding observations, satellite precipitation data, and reanalysis datasets. The results indicate that the Global Precipitation Measurement satellite precipitation product accurately captured the temporal and spatial variations in this rainstorm, as verified against hourly in situ observation data. Some meteorological stations recorded values greater than twice their historical records, such as Luopu, Pishan, Moyu, and Hotan. Moreover, the duration of the precipitation was longer than 2 days. For the physical mechanisms of this rainstorm, the water vapor in this rainstorm is sourced from the 45 degrees-65 degrees N region of the North Atlantic Ocean crosses the Ural Mountains and the West Siberian Plain to southern Xinjiang. The low-pressure levels (e.g., 700 hPa and 850 hPa) have the more water vapor flux and specific humidity than the high-pressure levels. Our findings can aid the understanding of extreme precipitation events in Central Asia and provide a reference for dealing with meteorological disasters, including extreme precipitation, in the context of global climate change.

In this regard, it is important to understand the relationship of soil CS with effective factors such as tree cover, soil texture, and land slope. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of soil properties on SCS in almond orchards in Borujerd, Iran. Twenty almond orchards located in floodplains and/or piedmont plains were selected randomly and soil samples were taken at three depths (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) of both under tree canopies and bare soil. The soil physicochemical properties were determined in laboratory. The results showed that, on average, mean carbon sequestration rates were higher both under tree canopies and on bare ground in floodplains than piedmont plains and increased at greater depths in both regions. SCS had a negative relationship with soil bulk density and sand percentage but positive relationships with clay and silt percentages. However, increases in saturation moisture and nitrogen contents of the soils had a positive effect on SCS. In general, the higher SCS under trees than bare soil, and in fine-textured than coarse-textured soils, indicate the importance of establishing almond plantations, especially in sloping lands, to mitigate soil erosion and enhance carbon sequestration.

South Africa experienced one of the worst droughts in its history from 2015 to 2017 and, as a result, all but the permanent waterbodies of the lower Phongolo River floodplain (PRF) in northern KwaZulu-Natal dried up. This study examined the resilience of aquatic invertebrates associated with the PRF and what the colonization and succession trends of aquatic invertebrates would be once floodplain pools were to receive water again following a 2-year drought. Water and aquatic invertebrates were collected 11 times from nine field mesocosms over a 5-week period for chemical and biodiversity analysis, respectively. Zooplankton hatched from resting stages and macroinvertebrates colonized the mesocosms from nearby permanent waterbodies within the first week of inundation, suggesting that the drought had not affected the ability of aquatic biota to continue natural colonization and succession. Although the biota appeared unaffected, an extension of such a drought could lead to habitat fragmentation and total desiccation of permanent waterbodies, potentially causing the local extinction of aquatic populations and a loss of biodiversity.

The potential of Herentals for a leapfrog to water sensitive	CITIES			English	Article						Water governance; Leapfrogging; Small size city; Urban water transition; Blue-green infrastructure	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSTAINABLE WATER; URBAN; CHALLENGES; POLICY; WASTE; TRANSITIONS; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE	Climate change, population growth and land-use change have increased the risk of urban floods. Urban floods cause severe damages to cities and their inhabitants, and they are expected to increase over time. Consequently, urban adaptation is required to shift from traditional infrastructure to Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). Until recently, studies on BGI implementation have centred around large cities in developed countries. Meanwhile, medium and small size cities have received less attention. According to the Urban Water Management Transition Framework (UWMTF), cities can leapfrog towards more 'water sensitive' practices. Although leapfrogging is context-dependent, our understanding of how governance factors support leapfrogging remains embryonic. This paper contributes to the scholarly understanding of the governance factors that support and limit leapfrogging. By applying the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT) and considering three catalytic factors that underpin leapfrogging, this research assessed the process to implement the BGI project named Olympiadelaan in Herentals, Belgium. Overall, the governance context support was assessed as moderate. The regional and provincial governments play a key role in reaching this moderate level of support. This moderate support helps the city level to speed up its urban water management transition, but it is not enough to skip the states in the UWMTF.

Inadequate mitigation measures regarding severity and consecutive events of floods have badly affected millions of households' livelihoods. Pakistan has experienced five consecutive floods in the current decade from 2010 to 2015. These floods severely affected the mostly districts of Punjab province among these three most flood-affected districts Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh, and Rajanpur were selected for this research work. This study used the cross-sectional data of 840 flood-affected households from these three districts. Empirical estimates indicated the study area households major adaptation measures were foundation strengthen, elevated ground floor, precautionary saving, and construction of the house with reinforced material. Probit model estimates signified age, gender, location, and family size; monthly income, physical disability, education, and house ownership were major factors influencing mitigation strategies of households' level. Limited resources, inadequate planning for land use, lack of advanced and early warning system, and inadequate sound financial status were major obstacles regarding households' level adaptation of mitigation strategies. In addressing household level obstacles regarding advanced adaptation measures, development requires for local disaster policies such as ample spatial planning, codes of house building, practices of building infrastructure, propagation and forecasting updated flood information, and advanced and updated early warning system.

We evaluate the degree to which equity policies in local networks of plans support risk reduction for socially vulnerable populations, and examine the relationship between equity policies scores and the level of social vulnerability in six cities exposed to floods and projected sea level rise. We find high variability in equity policy support for risk reduction, and that equity policies in plans actually actively increase risk of loss in neighborhoods with high levels of social vulnerability, which in turn could disrupt further development.

Brief communication: Rethinking the 1998 China floods to prepare for a nonstationary future	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RIVER-FLOOD	A mega-flood in 1998 caused tremendous losses in China and triggered major policy adjustments in flood-risk management. This paper aims to retrospectively examine these policy adjustments and discuss how China should adapt to newly emerging flood challenges. We show that China suffers annually from floods despite large-scale investments and policy adjustments. Rapid urbanization and climate change will exacerbate future flood risk in China, with cascading impacts on other countries through global trade networks. Therefore, novel flood-risk management approaches are required, such as a risk-based urban planning and coordinated water governance systems with public participation, in addition to traditional structural protection.

The communities' lack of awareness of these rising vulnerabilities subsequently impacts their willingness to tackle upcoming challenges. The latter strongly relies on the public perception and efficiency of the ongoing waterways and waterscape transformations, which remains largely unquantified. To address this deficiency, we evaluate these factors for the historic transformed 21-km canal in Alexandria's vulnerable arid port city. We perform a public survey based on the City Development Strategy for Sustainable Development criterion, assessing the inhabitants' perceptions of the degeneration and transformation of the city's most iconic and historic urban waterway. Our results suggest that the waterscape's multiple transformations negatively influenced the inhabitants' awareness of Alexandria's coastal vulnerabilities and led to public disconnection from the city's maritime heritage, visual attributes, and environment. This disconnection resulting from decades of degrading waterways and inefficient landscape transformations is mainly observed among youth and further compromises the city's resilience to upcoming coastal hazards and aggravates the ecological and coastal degradations. We suggest an adaptive conceptual plan of waterways regeneration to restore their roles in mitigating climatic challenges and improving public connectivity to the historic city's marine identity.

Future Changes in Climate and Hydroclimate Extremes in East Africa	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						East Africa; climate change; droughts; floods; CMIP6; extremes	TEMPERATURE; WATER; SELECTION; DROUGHT; MODEL	Climate change is affecting the agriculture, water, and energy sectors in East Africa and the impact is projected to increase in the future. To allow adaptation and mitigation of the impacts, we assessed the changes in climate and their impacts on hydrology and hydrological extremes in East Africa. We used outputs from seven CMIP-6 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 1981-2010 is used as a reference period. The output from GCMs are statistically downscaled using the Bias Correction-Constructed Analogs with Quantile mapping reordering method to drive a high-resolution hydrological model. The Variable Infiltration Capacity and vector-based routing models are used to simulate runoff and streamflow across 68,300 river reaches in East Africa. The results show an increase in annual precipitation (up to 35%) in Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya and a decrease (up to 4.5%) in Southern Tanzania in the 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100). During the long rainy season (March-May), precipitation is projected to be higher (up to 43%) than the reference period in Southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda but lower (up to -20%) in Tanzania. Large parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Southern Ethiopia show an increase in precipitation (up to 38%) during the short rainy season (October-December). Temperature and evapotranspiration will continue to increase in the future. Further, annual and seasonal streamflow and hydrological extremes (droughts and floods) are projected to increase in large parts of the region throughout the 21st century calling for site-specific adaptation.

Wet season flood magnitude drives resilience to dry season drought of a euryhaline elasmobranch in a dry-land river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Metabolic rate; Temperature; Body condition; Environmental change; Kimberley; Sawfish; Pristis pristis	FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; AUSTRALIAN DRYLAND RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; VARIABILITY; RESPONSES; TEMPERATURE; HABITAT; PRINCIPLES; SCENARIOS	The increase in severity and occurrence of drought from environmental change poses a significant threat to freshwater ecosystems. However, many of the mechanisms by which periodic drought affects aquatic animals are poorly understood. Here we integrated physical, physiological, and behavioural measurements made in the field over a twelve-year period to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the loss of body condition of fish in arid rivers, using the Critically Endangered freshwater sawfish (Pristis pristis) in the dry-land Fitzroy River, Western Australia, as a model species. Sawfish lost condition throughout the long dry season in all years and had significantly poorer body condition throughout years characterized by low volumes of wet season flooding and little occurrence of overbank flooding. A mechanistic examination of factors leading to this loss of condition using measurements of body temperature, field energetics, and habitat use from telemetry techniques showed that the loss of condition throughout the season was likely due to substantial habitat compression and lowproductivity in drier years, while high rates of competitionwere more likely to drive this pattern in wetter years. This information can be used to forecast how climate change and water abstraction will affect aquatic fauna experiencing intermittent drought and can inform management decisions to help mitigate these threats.

To consider nonstationarity in regional frequency analysis, several nonstationary index flood (NS-IF) methods comprising a time-dependent site-specific scaling factor or nonstationary regional growth curves have been suggested. However, these methods have limitations related to underestimation from using sample statistics as a site-specific scaling factor or considering nonstationarity only in regional parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, this study developed a nonstationary population index flood (NS-PIF) method that considers nonstationarity in the statistical characteristics at each site in a region based on nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for synthetic regions under various nonstationary conditions to compare the performance of the NS-PIF method with those of existing NS-IF methods. Then the applicability of the NS-PIF method to real-world data was assessed via Monte Carlo simulations of regions with annual maximum rainfall data in South Korea. The results indicated that the NS-PIF method can solve the underestimation problem inherent in existing NS-IF methods. Moreover, the NS-PIF method yielded the best performance and provided more reliable and reasonable quantile estimates considering site-specific trends. In addition, the heterogeneity measure based on L-skewness and L-kurtosis was identified as a suitable test of homogeneity for application of the proposed method.

With increased concern over ongoing climate change, more detailed and precise information about climate-change risks is required for formulating local-scale countermeasures. However, the impacts of biases in climate-model outputs on river-flood simulation have not been fully evaluated, and thus evaluation of future flood risks using hazard maps (high-resolution spatial-distribution maps of inundation depths) has not been achieved. Therefore, this study examined methods for constructing future-flood-hazard maps and discussed their validity. Specifically, we compared the runoff-correction method that corrects for bias in general-circulation-model (GCM) runoff using the monthly climatology of reanalysis runoff with the lookup method, which uses the GCM simulation results without bias correction to calculate changes in the return period and depends on the reanalysis simulation to determine absolute flood depths. The results imply that the runoff-correction method may produce significantly different hazard maps compared to those based on reanalysis of runoff data. We found that, in some cases, bias correction did not perform as expected for extreme values associated with the hazard map, even under the historical climate, as the bias of extreme values differed from that of the mean value. We found that the change direction of a future hazard (increase or decrease) obtained using the runoff-correction method relative to the reference reanalysis-based hazard map may be inconsistent with changes projected by Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain Model (CaMa-Flood) simulations based on GCM runoff input in some cases. On the other hand, the lookup method produced future-hazard maps that are consistent with flood-hazard changes projected by CaMa-Flood simulations obtained using GCM runoff input, indicating the possibility of obtaining a reasonable inundated-area distribution. These results suggest that the lookup method is more suitable for future-flood hazard-map construction than the runoff-correction method. The lookup method also has the advantage of facilitating research on efficient construction of future-climate hazard maps, as it allows for improvement of the reanalysis hazard map through upgrading of the model and separate estimation of changes due to climate change. We discuss future changes at the global scale in inundation areas and the affected population within the inundation area. Using the lookup method, the total population living in modeled inundation areas with flood magnitudes exceeding the 100-year return period under a future climate would be approximately 1.86 billion. In the assessment of future-climate risks, we found that an affected population of approximately 0.2 billion may be missed if the historical-hazard map is used as an alternative to constructing future-hazard maps, and only frequency changes are considered. These results suggest that, in global flood-risk studies, future-hazard maps are important for proper estimation of climate-change risks rather than assessing solely changes in the frequency of occurrence of a given flood intensity.

Past policy aspirations and extensive water infrastructures have shaped the delta into one the most significant food producing landscapes in Southeast Asia. Yet, these changes have also created new environmental risks by transforming the hydrological system. Research has produced a growing and increasingly diverse empirical literature on the delta's environmental context, without necessarily providing water resource managers, policymakers and practitioners with the information needed to galvanize more resilient development. This focus review presents a detailed overview of the recent scientific findings, exploring how the management of water resources is changing, as well as their inter-relationship with land use, policy, socio-economic transitions, and global environmental crises. Compound and systemic risks to the delta include climate change, hydrometeorological hazards, upstream developments and an unsustainable development trajectory. We outline scientific knowledge gaps, as well as the pressing need for sharable analysis-ready data and innovations. Finally, we provide recommended future research avenues for multiscale actions toward a sustainable and resilient delta future.This article is categorized under:Human Water > Water GovernanceScience of Water > Water ExtremesScience of Water > Water and Environmental Change	[Tri, Van Pham Dang] Can Tho Univ, Res Inst Climate Change DRAGON Mekong, Can Tho, Vietnam; [Yarina, Lizzie] MIT Sch Architecture & Planning, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA USA; [Nguyen, Hong Quan] Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Circular Econ Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Nguyen, Hong Quan] Vietnam Natl Univ, Inst Environm & Resources, Ctr Water Management & Climate Change, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Downes, Nigel K.] Can Tho Univ, Coll Environm & Nat Resources, Can Tho, Vietnam	Can Tho University; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; Can Tho University	Downes, NK (corresponding author), Can Tho Univ, Coll Environm & Nat Resources, Can Tho, Vietnam.	nkdownes@ctu.edu.vn	; Pham Dang Tri, VAN/M-5680-2016	Yarina, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6924-3436; Pham Dang Tri, VAN/0000-0002-2989-2001; Downes, Nigel/0000-0002-5570-5724	German development cooperation; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM); German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development	German development cooperation; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM); German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development	The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and publication of this article.

J	Devendiran, DK; Banerjee, S				Devendiran, Dinesh Kumar; Banerjee, Swagata			Effect of bridge design parameters on multi-hazard performance of river-crossing bridges	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-STRUCTURES AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						bridges; earthquakes; floods; multi-hazard; risk assessment	SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK	River-crossing bridges in seismically active regions are typically susceptible to two natural hazards - earthquakes and floods. For such bridges, design parameters related to piers may play major roles in bridge multi-hazard performance. In this study, the same was explored for key bridge design parameters - the aspect ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio of piers and the differential ground elevation between multiple bents. The multi-hazard condition in the southeast of Nepal was considered as the test-bed hazard condition. The regional seismic hazard was represented using a suite of earthquakes generated based on regional seismic design spectra. Due to the flood hazard in the region, expected pier scour of investigated bridges was estimated from 100-year flood discharge (including climate change projection) in the Koshi River, Nepal. Three-dimensional finite-element models of the chosen bridges, with and without scour and with & PLUSMN;10% variations in the stated design parameters, were developed. Fragility and risk curves of the bridges were developed and compared in order to assess the relative influence of the design parameters on bridge performance. It was found that the aspect ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio of piers can significantly influence the multi-hazard performance of riverine bridges. The findings also demonstrate how design parameters may be revised to perform risk-targeted multi-hazard design of bridges.

Consequently, it is necessary to quantify coastal hazards vulnerability and develop tools to monitor coastal risks and support making targeted climate adaptation policies. In this paper, a framework to estimate coastal vulnerability to flooding and erosion has been developed for the Ionian Basilicata coast. It is based on two methods: the integrated vulnerability index (flooding and erosion) and the CeD physical vulnerability index (multi-risk assessment). Our results are in agreement with the recent shoreline evolution: the integrated coastal risk of the Ionian Basilicata coast is generally medium to high, while the "physical erosion vulnerability" is generally high to very high. In addition, the results highlight a spatial variability of the vulnerability, probably due to the morphology of the beach, which requires developing a strategic approach to coastal management and defining mitigation measures, considering relevant risk aspects as the vulnerability and exposure degree.

J	Li, JD				Li, Jiada			Exploring the potential of utilizing unsupervised machine learning for urban drainage sensor placement under future rainfall uncertainty	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sensor placement design; Nonstationary rainfall; Floods detection; Cluster analysis; Future adaptability	WATER-DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; IMPACTS; URBANIZATION; DESIGN; MODEL	Recently, advanced informatics and sensing techniques show promise of enabling a new generation of smart stormwater systems, where real-time sensors are deployed to detect flooding hotspots. Existing stormwater design criteria assume that historical rainfall frequency and intensity are reliable predictors to place real-time sensing devices. However, nonstationarity in rainfall due to climate change violates this assumption by disturbing hydrologic regimes and relocating flooding spots. This paper proposes a novel methodology of combining unsupervised machine learning (Agglomerative Clustering) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to optimize the sensor placement under uncertain rainfalls. An urban drainage network located in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, is chosen as the case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. Results show that: i) the proposed Agglomerative Clustering and ANOVA integrated approach can efficiently and accurately pinpoint sensor locations for drainage flooding detection; ii) rainfall uncertainty has limited impacts on the number of sensors, but it induces significant effects on sensor locations from the historical period (2000-2009) to the future period (2040-2049). By exploring the effects of climate nonstationarity on sensor placement, this work aims to help engineers and decision-makers better respond to the changing climates and rainfall extremes in urban drainage catchments.

According to the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE), the stormwater system received a condition state "D+". Even though existing management systems for storm pipes optimize the timing of maintenance and replacement aiming at improving the overall storm pipes' network condition, they ignored the effect of urban growth and climate change (i.e. intense and frequent rainfall cause flooding) on the pipes' deterioration. Thus, this paper presents a scheduling decision-making framework that opts at optimizing the pipes' replacement decisions to increase their resiliency while considering the annual expenditures, urban growth and its' future impact on the demand. To demonstrate the system's functionality, it was deployed on the storm pipes of Kindersley in Saskatchewan, Canada. The results showed that $300,000 a year was enough to meet the city's condition and flow demand-capacity goals, enhance their average condition from 33% to 63% and drop the flow demand-capacity to 64%. Furthermore, replacements' breakdown analysis indicated that longer analysis periods enhance the system's capability in capturing the long-term impact of the decisions.

However, evidence of treated and untreated mental disorders based on diagnostic criteria for the general population is limited. We analysed the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a large probability sample survey of adults in England (n = 7525), that provides the only national data on the prevalence of mental disorders assessed to diagnostic criteria. The most recent survey (2014-2015) asked participants if they had experienced damage to their home (due to wind, rain, snow or flood) in the six months prior to interview, a period that included months of unprecedented population exposure to flooding, particularly in Southern England. One in twenty (4.5%) reported living in a storm- or flood-damaged home in the previous six months. Social advantage (home ownership, higher household income) increased the odds of exposure to storm or flood damage. Exposure predicted having a common mental disorder over and above the effects of other known predictors of poor mental health. With climate change increasing the frequency and severity of storms and flooding, improving community resilience and disaster preparedness is a priority. Evidence on the mental health of exposed populations is key to building this capacity.

The city of Guayaquil, located along the Guayas, is the main port of Ecuador but, at the same time, the planet's fourth most vulnerable city to future flooding due to climate change. Sedimentation, which has increased in recent years, is seen as one of the factors contributing to the risk of flooding. The cause of this sedimentation is the subject of the current research. We used the process-based Delft3D FM model to assess the dominant processes in the river and the effects that past interventions along the river and its estuary have had on the overall sediment budget. Additionally, a simulation including sea level rise was used in order to understand the possible future impact of climate change on the sediment budget. Results indicate an increase in tidal asymmetry due to land reclamation and a decrease in episodic flushing by river floods due to upstream dam construction. These processes have induced an increased import of marine sediment potentially responsible for the observed sedimentation. This is in contrast with the local perception of the problem, which ascribes sedimentation to deforestation in the upper catchment. Only the deposition of silt and clay in connected stagnant water bodies could perhaps be ascribed to upstream deforestation.

Reliable flood modelling is challenging due to the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation intensity, duration and frequency, heterogeneity in temperature rise and land-use changes. Reliable high-resolution precipitation data and distributed hydrological model can solve the problem. This study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simulate streamflow extremes from satellite-based high-resolution climate data. Four widely used bias correction methods were compared to select the best method for downscaling coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) global climate model (GCMs) simulations. A novel ML-based distributed hydrological model was developed for modelling runoff from the corrected satellite rainfall data. Finally, the model was used to project future changes in runoff and streamflow extremes from the downscaled GCM projected climate. The Johor River Basin (JRB) in Malaysia was considered as the case study area. The distributed hydrological model developed using ML showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.96 and 0.78 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.01 and 5.64 during calibration and validation. The simulated flow analysis using the model showed that the river discharge would increase in the near future (2020-2059) and the far future (2060-2099) for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The largest change in river discharge would be for SSP-585. The extreme rainfall indices, such as Total Rainfall above 95th Percentile (R95TOT), Total Rainfall above 99th Percentile (R99TOT), One day Max Rainfall (R x 1day), Five-day Max Rainfall (R x 5day), and Rainfall Intensity (RI), were projected to increase from 5% for SSP-119 to 37% for SSP-585 in the future compared to the base period. The results showed that climate change and socio-economic development would cause an increase in the frequency of streamflow extremes, causing larger flood events.

These include the transition from the Preclassic to the Classic, and from Classic to the Postclassic. Previous research emphasized a causal relationship between drought and cultural change, or so-called "collapse" in the Maya region. Recent advances in the range and precision of climate-sensitive proxies and the development of new archives have enabled quantitative reconstructions of past hydroclimate, as well as providing evidence of high impact, short-duration events, such as tropical cyclones. Simultaneously, archaeological research has unearthed widespread evidence of technologies used by the Maya to exert control over water resources in urban, rural, and agricultural settings. Evidence suggests that many of these water features were in use for multiple generations, possibly centuries, and many were constructed during the Terminal Preclassic and Terminal Classic periods. We suggest that, given the availability of new archaeological and paleoclimate records, these data can be combined to identify the full complexity of Maya adaptation to hydroclimate variability to emphasize adaptation and resilience to both water scarcity and over-abundance (e.g., flooding). Such syntheses, which can offer lessons for present-day efforts to grapple with regional climate change, will benefit from additional studies in data-poor zones of the Maya region, as well as public archiving of paleoclimate and archaeological data.

Climate change is increasingly blamed for such environmental degradation, but in many regions, direct anthropogenic pressures compound, and sometimes supersede, climatic factors. This study examined a human environmental system - the terminal Hamun Lakes on the Iran-Afghanistan border - that embodies amplified challenges of inland waters. Satellite and climatic data from 1984 to 2019 were fused, which documented that the Hamun Lakes lost 89% of their surface area between 1999 and 2001 (3809 km2 versus 410 km2), coincident with a basin-wide, multi-year meteorological drought. The lakes continued to shrink afterwards and desiccated in 2012, despite the above-average precipitation in the upstream basin. Rapid growth in irrigated agricultural lands occurred in upstream Afghanistan in the recent decade, consuming water that otherwise would have fed the Hamun Lakes. Compounding upstream anthropogenic stressors, Iran began storing flood water that would have otherwise drained to the lakes, for urban and agricultural consumption in 2009. Results from a deep Learning model of Hamun Lakes' dynamics indicate that the average lakes' surface area from 2010 to 2019 would have been 2.5 times larger without increasing anthropogenic stresses across the basin. The Hamun Lakes' desiccation had major socio-environmental consequences, including loss of livelihood, out-migration, dust-storms, and loss of important species in the region.

Internet Communication on the Flood Disaster in West Germany of July 2021 between Conspiracy Theories and Moralization-A Neopragmatic Explorative Study	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood; West Germany; conspiracy theory; conflict; climate change; moralization; Dahrendorf; Luhmann	NEGOTIATION PROCESSES; LANDSCAPE CONFLICTS; GRID EXTENSION; PRAGMATISM	The aim of this article is an explorative study of the debate on the flood in the western part of Germany in July 2021, based on the comments found below the coverage of a German public television channel (ZDF) published on YouTube. Based on the neopragmatic framing of the analysis by connecting morality and mass media according to Luhmann, as well as Dahrendorf's conflict theory, four patterns of interpretation were identified which illustrate a high moralization of the conflict: conclusions drawn from the storm (e.g., of a political nature, references to COVID-19, etc.), far-reaching, predominantly negative interpretations that place the storm and its consequences in the context of other negatively interpreted aspects, as well as rational and empathetic interpretations regarding expressions of sympathy and offers of help, and, ultimately, interpretations that range from climate change and planning failures to various conspiracy-theoretical claims of responsibility for the flooding. All in all, a transformation from conflicts of interest and facts to conflicts of identity and values is taking place, revealing two utopias: the utopia in which man and nature are in harmonic unity, as well as the utopia of the satisfaction of individual (material) needs in a stable material-spatial and legal framework. Science has an instrumental application in both utopias.</p>	[Kuehne, Olaf; Koegst, Lara; Zimmer, Marie-Luise; Schaeffauer, Greta] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Dept Geog, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany	Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen	Koegst, L (corresponding author), Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Dept Geog, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.	olaf.kuehne@uni-tuebingen.de; Lara.Koegst@uni-tuebingen.de; marie-luise.zimmer@uni-tuebingen.de; greta-marei.schaeffauer@student.uni-tuebingen.de	Koegst, Lara/GYV-1738-2022; Kühne, Olaf/AAE-2288-2020	Koegst, Lara/0000-0001-7162-2091; Zimmer, Marie-Luise/0000-0002-8059-4827	Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tuebingen	Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tuebingen	We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Tuebingen.

Yet, future flood risk has not been well studied due primarily to a limited availability of detailed and consistent data on future vulnerability components and the computationally expensive continental flood modeling. Here we perform a top-down data driven flood risk assessment for 20-, 30-, 50- and 100-year return periods over Europe at the continental, regional and national levels for the late 21st century. To account for the impact of changes in both climatic and socioeconomic conditions on floods, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are merged with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), integrating hazard and several social, economic and agricultural exposure-vulnerability proxy indicators. Our results show a ubiquitous drastic increase up to 87% in future flood risks of different return periods over Europe, with eastern and southern regions experiencing the highest risk increase. A fossil-fuel based development in the future would lead to 14-15% higher flood risk compared to a sustainable development, which goes up to 23% in north Europe. The amplified future flood risk is predominantly driven by climate change, although with a large uncertainty, rather than socioeconomic drivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Learning from risk reduction pilot projects for enhancing long-term adaptation governance: The case of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Governance; Coastal risks; Small islands	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; MITIGATION; QUESTION	In Mauritius island in the Indian Ocean, as in most low-lying coastal areas and Small Island Developing States in particular, coastal risks affect community livelihood, economic prosperity and the degradation of natural ecosystems. Risks of coastal erosion and marine flooding result both from climate-related ocean changes and anthropogenic drivers such as inappropriate coastal development and structural protection measures. Poor development planning and lack of coordination between public and private actors have increased the exposure of human assets along the Mauritius coastline. To reduce these risks, the government leads risk reduction activities in coastal zones, functioning on a centralized top-down governance approach. In recent years, this governance framework has been evolving by opening up participatory channels and exploring a long-term adaptation perspective. Progress is driven by international engagements and demonstration projects to embrace soft measures, nature-based options and integrated solutions. We review a selection of pilot projects undertaken by the government that illustrate flexibility in a 'learning by doing' model. However, we find that certain governance arrangements do not allow to draw the most from ad hoc projects because they do not feed into a long-term comprehensive plan. We consider the role of evidence and risk assessments, learning processes and coordination mechanisms as key governance mechanisms required for a robust and evolving national coastal risk reduction and adaptation policy framework.

Recurrent droughts and floods have led to chronic food insecurity linked to poor maternal and neonatal nutrition outcomes in vulnerable regions. We analyzed maternal and neonatal nutrition trends and subnational variability between 2000 and 2021 with a focus on the implementation of policies and programs surrounding two acute climate shocks in 2005 and 2010. We used four sources of data: (a) national household surveys for maternal and newborn nutritional indicators allowing computation of trends and differences at national and regional levels; (b) document review of food security reports; (c) 30 key informant interviews and; (d) one focus group discussion. Many food security policies and nutrition programs were enacted from 2000 to 2020. Gains in maternal and neonatal nutrition indicators were more significant in targeted vulnerable regions of Maradi, Zinder, Tahoua and Tillaberi, from 2006 to 2021. However, poor access to financial resources for policy execution and suboptimal implementation of plans have hindered progress. In response to the chronic climate crisis over the last 20 years, the Nigerien government and program implementers have demonstrated their commitment to reducing food insecurity and enhancing resilience to climate shocks by adopting a deliberate multisectoral effort. However, there is more that can be achieved with a continued focus on vulnerable regions to build resilience, targeting high risk populations, and investing in infrastructure to improve health systems, food systems, agriculture systems, education systems, and social protection. Multisectoral nutrition and food security policy and program investments in response to climate shocks in vulnerable regions have played a meaningful role in improving food security and maternal and fetal growth in Niger over the last 20 years.image Niger is ranked as the most vulnerable country in the world for exposure and sensitivity to the negative effects of disasters and climate change. Acute environmental shocks in 2005 and 2010 elevated government and development partner responses to the 'food security crises'.Multisectoral policy and program investments in vulnerable regions played a meaningful role in improving food security and subsequently maternal and neonatal nutrition but progress is slow or stagnant.The Nigerien government, program implementers, and donors should prioritize investments in infrastructure and shock resilience to improve health systems, food systems, agriculture systems, education systems, and social protection, particularly in high risk populations.

Despite scholarly recognition that adaptation pathways should reduce multidimensional vulnerabilities and inequalities, current adaptation efforts largely preserve the status quo. Many benefit powerful actors while further entrenching the poor and disadvantaged in cycles of dispossession. We bring together scholarship on adaptation pathways, politics and practice to deconstruct adaptation trajectories. We propose three conceptual steps - acknowledging injustices, embracing deliberation and nurturing responsibility for human and more-than-human others - to chart inclusive pathways towards just climate futures.

Large artificial reservoirs may effectively alleviate hydro-climatic extremes, but their storage capacities are threatened by sedimentation processes, which in turn are exacerbated by land use change. Envisioning strategies for sustainable reservoir management requires interdisciplinary model chains to emulate key processes driving sedimentation under global change scenarios. Therefore, we introduce a model chain for the long-term prediction of complex three-dimensional (3d) reservoir sedimentation considering concurrent catchment, hydro-climatic, and land-use conditions. Applied to a mountainous Mediterranean catchment, the model chain predicts increased sediment production and decreased discharge for high and medium emission pathways. Increased winter precipitation, accompanied by a transition from snowfall to rainfall, is projected to aggravate reduced summer precipitation, emphasizing a growing need for reservoirs. Additionally, higher winter precipitation proliferates sediment production and reservoir sedimentation. Land use change can outweigh the increased reservoir sedimentation originating from hydro-climatic change, which highlights the significance of localized actions to reduce sediment production. Finally, a 3d hydro-morphodynamic model provides insights into interactions between global change and reservoir sedimentation with spatially explicit information on future sedimentation patterns facilitating the implementation of management strategies.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable due to limited resources and adaptive capacity. Early warnings are critical in mitigating and reducing climate-related dangers and building resiliency. That notwithstanding, there needs to be higher coverage of early warnings in developing countries, and there is even less knowledge of their contribution to rural development. Using a cross-sectional survey involving smallholder farmer households (n = 517), this study investigates the relationship between early warnings and perceived climate preparedness in Ghana's semi-arid Upper West Region. From ordered logistic regression presented as an odds ratio (OR), factors that influenced climate preparedness in the past 12 months before the study include exposure to early warnings (OR = 2.238; p < 0.001) and experiences of prior climate events such as drought (OR = 9.252; p < 0.001), floods (OR = 6.608; p < 0.001), and erratic rain (OR = 4.411; p < 0.001). The results emphasize the importance of early warning systems and various socioeconomic factors in improving the climate resilience of smallholder farmers in Ghana. In conclusion, the study puts forth policy suggestions worth considering.	[Pienaah, Cornelius K.

Therefore, people are affected significantly during floods experienced in urban areas and road networks, as well as they, may be stranded at these points due to flooding, traffic jams, and flooding of vehicles. Thus, the quick search and rescue activities in these areas may reduce the loss of life and property. This study aims to create safe routes for emergency response teams and people in urban floods. For this purpose, 2D flood analysis is carried out, and flood risk classes are determined for vehicles and people according to the results of this analysis. According to these determined flood risk classes, the most appropriate point in the flood area is found for the emergency response teams to carry out their search and rescue activities effectively. The most suitable routes for emergency response teams are obtained in four different scenarios. In addition, 13 different safe points are identified for pedestrians in the flood area, and routes are created to reach these points. Consequently, the findings of the study demonstrate that during flooding, human evacuations and search and rescue activities may happen fast.

Temporal stability of soil organic carbon in grazing lands of Eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER			English	Article						Soil organic carbon; drought; climate variability; carbon cycling; carbon sequestration; climate change	TERRESTRIAL CARBON; SEASONAL-VARIATION; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; WATER; STOCKS; SEQUESTRATION; VARIABILITY; EROSION; MODEL	Sequestering soil organic carbon (SOC) has been identified as a critical tool to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, the response of SOC to climate variability needs to be quantified to achieve carbon sequestration over decadal to centennial scales. This study assesses the temporal variability of SOC for a grazed catchment in Australia that has been exposed to periods of drought and flood over the last 100 years. The analysis utilises field-measured SOC data obtained 2006-2018, along with modelled SOC data derived from a linear regression model and BIOS2 model outputs (1908-2015). Catchment SOC did not vary significantly, with mean values of 3.40% (2006), 3.21% (2014) and 3.10% (2018), despite the catchment experiencing extreme drying and wetting events during the sampling period. This stability was further supported by the long-term modelling, which showed a mean SOC of 3.68% and coefficient of variance of 0.16%. SOC was believed to be buffered against short term fluctuations in climate that persist for less than the SOC turnover times (i.e., multi-decadal). This indicates that temporal changes in SOC reflects only long-term climate variability. Current SOC and sequestered SOC are therefore unlikely to become a carbon sink in the short-term due to climate variability.	[Gibson, A.

However, the impacts of SRM remain unclear, making it difficult to project the benefits as well as consequences should this approach be adopted to combat climate change. To provide novel insight into the SRM impact on hydro-climatic extremes in Southeast Asia, this study conducts a simulation experiment for the Kelantan River Basin (KRB) in Malaysia by incorporating three bias-corrected Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS) members into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus (SWAT+) model. The study found that SRM practices could generate substantial cooling effects on regional temperatures, leading to a reduction in projected annual precipitation and monthly precipitation during the flooding season (from November to mid-January) under SRM relative to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. In addition, SRM could reduce the number of days with heavy precipitation as well as the intensity of maximum daily precipitation as compared to RCP8.5, during the 2045-2064 and 2065-2084 periods, leading to a reduction in high flows. Nevertheless, under SRM impacts, the driest months from February to May would experience comparable decreases in monthly precipitation and streamflow.

Particularly, little is known whether adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) augments crop yield and income. Therefore, we investigate the impact of CSA adoption on yield and income in Bangladesh, one of the countries of the world most vulnerable to climate change and disaster prone. To achieve this, based on primary data from a sample of 600 smallholder farms, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) is applied while controlling for endogeneity issues and selection bias of CSA adoption. For robustness check, propensity score matching (PSM) is applied. Consistent results from both models are found indicating that CSA adoption has yield and income effects on smallholder farms. Interestingly, if non-adopting households are soil salinity conscious and adopt CSA, their yield would increase by 7.55%. In addition, non-adopting households would significantly have tremendous income gains on account of CSA adoption. Results demonstrate that policy support measures for CSA adoption in flood-prone areas can have important implications for food security and poverty eradication through crop yield boosts and income augmentation in line with the purview of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Managers and planners can use social vulnerability assessment to optimize budget allocation, devise mitigation measures, and prepare for disasters. The purpose of this study was to determine the social vulnerability to natural disasters in the counties in Khuzestan Province (southwest Iran). This was accomplished by using geographic information system (GIS) methods and multi-criteria decision-making procedures. Data on the vulnerability to four distinct types of hazards (floods, earthquakes, landslides, and dust storms) were gathered, and the counties were ranked using fifteen social vulnerability indicators. The findings indicated that earthquakes and landslides have had the greatest impact on the vulnerability of the northern and northeastern counties in the province. Floods and dust storms have a greater impact on central, western, and southern counties. Western and eastern counties have the highest levels of social vulnerability, while southern counties have the lowest. The findings can be applied to establish plans for reducing social vulnerability and strengthening resilience in the province. Additionally, the methodology employed in the research project can be used to analyze social vulnerability in other countries with similar situations.

Accurate urban flood models are an established tool to predict flooding areas in urban as well as peri-urban catchments, to derive suitable measures to increase resilience against urban flooding. The high computational cost and complex processes of urban flooding with numerous subprocesses are the reason why many studies ignore the discussion of model uncertainties as well as model calibration and validation. In addition, the influence of steep surface (hillside) conditions on calibration parameters such as surface roughness are frequently left out of consideration. This study applies a variance-based approach to analyze the impact of three uncertainty sources on the two variables-flow and water depth-in a steep peri-urban catchment: (i) impact of DEM validation; (ii) calibration of the model parameter; (iii) differences between 1D/2D and 2D models. The results demonstrate the importance of optimizing sensitive model parameters, especially surface roughness, in steep catchments. Additional findings of this work indicate that the sewer system cannot be disregarded in the context of urban flood modeling. Further research with real heavy storm events is to be pursued to confirm the main results of this study.

Earthworms influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the soil both biologically (via respiration and litter modification) and physically (via increased macroporosity and altered air and water movement pathways). They improve soil carbon sequestration but also actively contribute to the release of major greenhouse gases. Shifting geographical ranges of earthworms due to changes in climatic conditions might affect the composition, structure and function of the soil ecosystem. This review examines the possible effects of the projected change in climate on earthworm communities and resulting implications for soil GHGs due to changes in environmental endpoints such as temperature and moisture. Earthworm activity, abundance, and biomass increase as soil moisture content increases, but drought and flooding reduce earthworm productivity. Climate change is likely to exacerbate earthworm invasions at higher latitudes and altitudes. However, because higher temperatures inhibit earthworm activities during droughts, anticipated warmer and drier climates may impede earthworm invasions. Climate change may disrupt the delicate balance between carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from soil in the coming century, but there are currently insufficient field studies to back up these prognostications.

Unsustainable use of land has contributed to the increase of vulnerability to natural disasters. Disasters and land use change have become major concerns all over the world. Agricultural land conversion (ALC) has been identified as one of the most significant drivers that influences ecosystems, and poses numerous challenges to agricultural development and human life. This systematic review study aimed to review the drivers and effects of ALC and CRDs on the one hand and their relations on the other. The paper further proposes a prevention policy framework towards the management of ALC and CRDs including three dimensions, i.e. monitoring-based policies, driver-based policies, and effect-based policies. All three types of these policies are important and essential because ALC and CRDs and their effects and drivers are interdependent. The study concludes that managing these phenomena not only needs to control and monitor their drivers but also requires preventing the effects. Avoiding the drivers and effects also involves monitoring the past, present, and future of ALC and CRD trends.

Objective We describe a collaborative project to establish the Texas Flood Registry to track the health and housing impacts of major flooding events. Methods Those who enroll in the registry answer retrospective questions regarding the impact of storms on their health and housing status. We recruit both those who did and did not flood during storm events to enable key comparisons. We leverage partnerships with multiple local health departments, community groups, and media outlets to recruit broadly. We performed a preliminary analysis using multivariable logistic regression and a binomial Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model. Results We find that those whose homes flooded, or who came into direct skin contact with flood water, are more likely to experience a series of self-reported health effects. Median household income is inversely related to adverse health effects, and spatial analysis provides important insights within the modeling approach. Significance Global climate change is likely to increase the number and intensity of rainfall events, resulting in additional health burdens. Population-level data on the health and housing impacts of major flooding events is imperative in preparing for our planet's future.

A total of 78 semi-structured interviews with heads of households were conducted. We found that both communities carried out practices and held beliefs associated with conservation, such as protecting trees and animal species considered sacred or perceived as beneficial for human life in terms of water provision and agricultural production. In addition to traditional ceremonies that respond to extreme climatic events such as drought and flood, other adaptation strategies used by the communities include moving to neighboring areas in search of better living conditions and using forest products in times of scarcity. We discuss that the management of the park should be agreed on, in a shared way, between local communities and conservation agents to ensure that these areas continue to perform the ecological, subsistence, and spiritual functions required. Our research results contribute to a better understanding of local adaptation dynamics towards extreme climatic events and improvement of management strategies.

J	Dale, M				Dale, Murray			Managing the effects of extreme sub-daily rainfall and flash floods-a practitioner's perspective	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						rainfall; climate modelling; guidance		Extreme sub-daily rainfall affects flooding in the UK and urban pollution management. Water utilities in the UK need to understand the characteristics of this rainfall, and how it may change in the future in order to plan for and manage these impacts. There is also significant interest from infrastructure owners and urban authorities exposed to flood risk from short-period, intense rainfall events. This paper describes how UK flood risk guidance incorporates allowances for climate change and how recent research using convection-permitting climate models is helping to inform this guidance. The guidance documents are used by engineers and scientists in the modelling of sewer networks, smaller river catchments and urban drainage areas and provide values to 'uplift' rainfall event data used as model inputs to reflect climate change model projections. With an increasing focus on continuous simulation modelling using time series rainfall, research into adjusting time series data to reflect future rainfall characteristics in convection-permitting climate models is discussed. Other knowledge gaps for practitioners discussed are the potential changing shape (profile) of future rainfall events and future changes in antecedent wetness conditions. The author explains the challenge of developing simple and effective guidance for practitioners from the complex scientific output. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.

It aims at understanding the formation of palaeolandscapes since the end of the last ice age. One part of the project studies the possible correlation and shift of archaeological settlement patterns, climate change and sea-level rise through time in order to derive archaeological expectancy maps. In this paper we present our findings for a quantifiable set of Stone Age sites in the area of the prehistorical Dornumer tidal basin, discussing them against the background of coastal environmental factors and the applied methodology of our modelling. To enable spatial analysis of these sites, we developed a palaeographic elevation model, which was subsequently flooded at 2000-year intervals between the Boreal and early Subboreal periods. Particular challenges are posed by the dynamics of marine transgression, the related changes in the natural environment and their spatial extent. As a result of our GIS-based approach, the model can be extended geographically and provides a basis for future research.

In the past 20 years, a frequent occurrence of heavy floods across the Xiang River basin (XRB) was witnessed, a major tributary of the Yangtze River basin (YRB), China. This study quantified impacts of precipitation extremes on streamflow changes across the XRB at annual and seasonal scales using the Mann-Kendall trend test (MK) method and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Besides, the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC) methods were employed to identify the correlations between extreme precipitation and streamflow. The results indicated no significant trends in annual rainfall and/or streamflow, while the increasing trends in the summer extreme rainfall and streamflow can be observed in the upper and middle XRB. Results by the XWT and WTC indicated highly similar patterns of signal changes at 1-4 and 5-12 years from the 1980s to 2005, between extreme precipitation and streamflow in the upper and middle river basin. Nevertheless, the changes in extreme precipitation in the lower reaches do not always coincide with the extreme streamflow variations. The coherence between extreme precipitation and river flows gradually declines from the upper to the lower basin.

However, glacial lake outburst floods have significantly jeopardized the safety of local residents. To better understand the changes in glacial lakes in response to climate change, it is necessary to conduct a long-term evaluation on the areal dynamics of glacial lakes, assisted with local observations. Here, we propose an innovative method of classification and stacking extraction to accurately delineate glacial lakes in southwestern Tibet from 1990 to 2020. Based on Landsat images and meteorological data, we used geographic detectors to detect correlation factors. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the driving factors of the changes in glacier lake area. We combined bathymetric data of the glacial lakes with the changes in climatic variables and utilized HEC-RAS to determine critical circumstances for glacial lake outbursts. The results show that the area of glacial lakes in Nyalam County increased from 27.95 km(2) in 1990 to 52.85 km(2) in 2020, and eight more glacial lakes were observed in the study area. The glacial lake area expanded by 89.09%, where we found significant growth from 2015 to 2020. The correlation analysis between the glacial lake area and climate change throughout the period shows that temperature and precipitation dominate the expansion of these lakes from 1990 to 2020. We also discover that the progressive increase in water volume of glacial lakes can be attributed to the constant rise in temperature and freeze-thaw of surrounding glaciers. Finally, the critical conditions for the glacial lake's outburst were predicted by using HEC-RAS combined with the changes in the water volume and climatic factors. It is concluded that GangxiCo endures a maximum water flow of 4.3 x 10(8) m(3), and the glacial lake is in a stable changing stage. This conclusion is consistent with the field investigation and can inform the prediction of glacial lake outbursts in southwestern Tibet in the future.

Such assessments are typically performed by obtaining future levels of climate factors such as precipitation and temperature from climate models and coupling them with hydrological models to simulate future hydrological processes. Different algorithm choices for the hydrological cycle module lead to non-negligible uncertainties in the simulation results. Based on a case study of a small watershed located in the upper Huaihe River, China, we develop a SWAT model based analyzing workflow that integrates two evapotranspiration calculation methods (Haegeraves and Penman Monteith), two river routing models (Variable Storage and Muskingum), and four calibrated parameters sets. This workflow can identify the uncertainties from algorithms of the internal modules of the hydrological model, model parameterization, and climate model (i.e., General Circulation Models, GCMs, and climate scenarios in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs) in the future runoff projections, and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that (1) the monthly runoff will increase in June and August and have little change in other months in 2021-2060, and increase in all months in 2061-2100; (2) annual mean runoff (Q(m)) and annual maximum runoff (Q(p)) will increase by 1.8% and 2.6% in the 2040s, and 14.7% and 18.6% in the 2080s; (3) the results of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) analysis indicates the probability of increase in Q(m) and Q(p) in all emission scenarios save the SSP 1-2.6 in the 2080s, and especially the probability of increase in Q(p) will be up to 97%; (4) for Q(m), the evapotranspiration calculation method is the main source of uncertainty, accounting for more than half of the total uncertainty; and for Q(p), GCM, SSP, and their interaction are the main sources of uncertainty with the contribution of about 70%. In contrast, the uncertainty arising from the parameterization of the hydrological model is small and can be ignored.

The results showed that dry tendency would occur in northwest China. The linear trend for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 were -0.056, -0.031, 0.009 and -0.072 per decade, respectively. While wet tendency would occur in the other regions over 2021-2100. The mild, moderate and severe dry/wet duration and severity over 2021-2060 and 2061-2100 would gradually decrease. Except for northwest China and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the extreme drought duration and severity would increase in the other subregions, while the extreme wet duration and severity would increase in most regions of China. The drought frequency in north China would range from 0 to 14 times and be smaller than the other regions over 2021-2060 and 2060-2100. However, the wet frequency in south China would be larger than that in the other regions. The dry/wet frequency duration and severity for the SSP5-8.5 scenario would be the largest among the four scenarios. The projected dry/wet conditions can provide useful information for future water resources management.

Among many rapidly changing lakes is the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) in Cambodia-Southeast Asia's largest inland lake-which is under growing threats from altered flows and inundation dynamics due to compounding effects of climate change and dam construction in the Mekong River basin (MRB). While previous studies have examined the potential causes of recent changes in open water areas, a mechanistic quantification of the lake's shifting hydrologic balance and inundation dynamics due to natural climate variability and dam operations is lacking. Here, using a hydrological-hydrodynamic modeling system that includes the major dams in the MRB, we show that while climate variability has been a key driver of inter-decadal variabilities in the lake's water balance, the operation of Mekong dams has exerted a growing influence-especially after 2010-on the Mekong flood pulse, Tonle Sap River's flow reversal, and the TSL's inundation dynamics. The dam-induced dampening of the Mekong's peak discharge increased from 1-2% during 1979-2009 to -7% in the 2010s, causing comparable alterations in the peak of inflow from the Mekong into TSL. More crucially, during the 2010s, the dams caused a reduction in annual inflow volume into TSL by 10-25% and shortened the annual inundation duration by up to 15 days in the lake's periphery. Further, seasonally inundated areas decreased (increased) most substantially by -245 km2 or -3% (-270 km2 or -6%) in August (April) during the 2010s. These results demonstrate that Mekong dams have already caused substantial alterations in the hydrologic balance and inundation dynamics of the TSL. Our findings offer critical insights relevant for improved transboundary water management and decision making in light of growing concerns about the adverse impacts of large dams in the MRB.

High dolomite content and occurrence of ubiquitous polysynthetic mica indicate that the sediments in core SS4 were mainly derived from the Yangtze River, while the relatively high epidote content represent the contribution of small local rivers from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. The substantial decrease in the epidote/hornblende ratio since similar to 730 yr BP manifests a decline in the relative contribution of sediment from the small local rivers to the core. We propose that the changes in drought/flood conditions in response to the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and human activities might have been mainly responsible for changes in sedimentary characteristics. During 1400-730 yr BP, the core sediments were characterized by relatively finer sensitive grain size and high epidote/hornblende ratio, due to a possibly weaker EAWM (i.e., less Yangtze River-derived sediment transported by the southward coast current). This time interval coincides with the Sui-Tang Warm Period (1400-1130 yr BP) in China and the Medieval Warm Period (1000-730 yr BP) on a broader regional scale. The prolonged warm periods were, however, interrupted by three short cold phases at 1350-1280 yr BP, 1130-1000 yr BP and 870-750 yr BP, characterized by coarse sensitive grain size and decreased epidote/hornblende ratio. Between 360 and 150 yr BP, the sensitive grain size significantly coarsened, which corresponded to the Little Ice Age. Our new findings suggest that sedimentation processes of mud wedge formation are responsive to natural environmental change and human activity.

However, understanding of their hydrological response is limited, especially in karst ecosystems, which are vulnerable to environmental changes. This study aimed to identify the spatial variability of the hydrological response in a mesoscale karst basin to climate change and ecological restoration. We examined changes in hydrological variables and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1985 to 2015 in Longjiang River Basin (LRB) and its three main sub- basins, namely Huanjiang (HJB), Zhongzhouxiaojiang (ZZB), and Dongxiaojiang (DXB) sub-basins. The pro- portions of karst landscapes (POK) were 81, 66, 61, and 26%, respectively. Three independent quantitative methods were employed to distinguish the relative contributions of climate change and human activity. Annual runoff showed a good linear correlation with precipitation in all the basins, with insignificantly lower average values during 2003-2015 than during 1985-2002. The relative contribution of precipitation to annual runoff change varied from 17.5 to 52.9%. At a seasonal scale, flood season precipitation and runoff decreased with similar patterns of annual variation, whereas non-flood season values increased from 1985-2007 to 2008-2015. The quantitative results showed that the relative contribution rates of human activity to non-flood season runoff change were strongly linked to POK values and related vegetation changes. Annual NDVI improved after the implementation of ecological restoration projects, with change rates negatively related to POK values. Human activity was the dominant cause of increased non-flood season runoff in the LRB and HJB (accounting for 57 and 78%, respectively), whereas increases in non-flood season runoff in the ZZB and DXB were mainly caused by precipitation changes (accounting for 84 and 172%, respectively). These findings highlighted the facts that ecological restoration had changed hydrological processes and seasonal-scale analyses might therefore facilitate a better understanding of runoff changes in karst basins.

Our area of interest is the Osan watershed in South Korea, where the summer monsoon contributes approximately 60-70% of the annual runoff and precipitation for the country. We determined the effects that future climatic changes have on this area. To accomplish this, we made use of global climate models (GCMs). A total of 10 GCMs were downscaled with the help of climate information production tools. Coupled with the GCMs and the Soil and Water Assessment (SWAT) model, three periods were used to assess these climate impacts. The baseline, mid-century (MC), and end-century (EC) periods include 1993-2018, 2046-2065, and 2081-2099, respectively. The entire process was performed using two scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) from the representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Some of the statistical metrics used for model calibration and validation were p-factor, r-factor, percent bias, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency. Their respective values were 0.88, 0.88, 8.3, 0.91, and 0.91 for calibration, and 1.16, 0.85, 7.9, 0.88, and 0.87 for validation. For the MC and EC periods under both scenarios, we projected an increase in temperature and precipitation of approximately 2-5 degrees C and 15-30%, respectively. A predicted rise in precipitation, surface flow, lateral flow, and water yield were noted for the month of June. Subsequently, a decline in July followed during the summer monsoon season. Summer monsoon rains will fluctuate more sharply, with heavy rainfall in June, lower rainfall in July, and more rain in the late summer, leading to the possibility of both flooding and drought within a given period. Annual precipitation, surface flow, lateral flow, and water yield will increase whereas evapotranspiration would decrease in both periods under both scenarios during the summer monsoon period, which will lead to wetter conditions in the future.

In this study, a framework is proposed to analyse daily-scale rainfall event characteristics based on global climate model (GCM) simulations. This framework includes bias correction of raw GCM-simulated rainfall series, selection of good-performing bias-corrected GCMs based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and evaluation of selected GCMs' skills in simulating rainfall event characteristics and finally assessment of changes in rainfall event characteristics in the future. In this study, 17 GCMs, four representative concentration pathways (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) and two future periods (i.e., 2041-2070 and 2071-2100) are considered. After bias correction of the GCMs using the monthly-scale double gamma distribution, 9 out of 17 GCMs with MAPE values smaller than 20% in the historical period 1971-2000 are selected. In general, these selected GCMs well capture the rainfall characteristics of different rainfall event classes. The multi-model ensembles suggest that compared to the historical period, the frequency of rainfall events with an extreme depth, short duration and long inter-event time will increase in the two future periods and the change in 2071-2100 is generally larger than that in 2041-2070, indicating that more extreme climate conditions may occur in Qu River basin in the future. Moreover, the temporal patterns of heavy rainfall events will become more non-uniform with more concentrated peak rainfall. The frequency of the delayed rainfall type (i.e., peaks occurring at the end of the rainfall event) will increase in the future, which can probably cause more severe floods and is very detrimental to flood defence in this study area.

However, the hydrological community generally ignores such data as its ability to predict streamflow change is largely unquantified and presumably considered biased. Here, we examined the ability of the 15 CMIP6 models to directly reproduce the observed mean annual streamflow change (Delta Q) between 1999-2014 and 1982-1998 for 115 large basins across the globe. The Delta Q and error of Delta Q in CMIP6 models (Delta Q_error) were then attributed to nine independent climate and vegetation variables using a stepwise regression model. Compared to the observations, almost all of the CMIP6 models overestimate Delta Q. In variable attribution, the observed Delta Q in the 115 basins can be well attributed (R2 = 0.59) to changes in precipitation (66 %), temperature (15 %), and leaf area index (-18 %). However, these variables could not explain Delta Q obtained from CMIP6 models (R2 = 0.13). In error attribution, errors in precipitation change contributes the most (69 +/- 12 %) to Delta Q_error in CMIP6 models, followed by location-related variables, changes in vegetation-related variables, and changes in temperature-related variables. Although the current performance of CMIP6 model outputs varies in simulating observed streamflow change, they may become more reliable with improved model structures for better representations of climate and land surface processes.

Here, we examined the effects of different rainfall patterns (i.e., timing and amount) on the phenological asynchrony of population of a generalist herbivore and their food sources in semiarid steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia. We conducted a 10-y (2010 to 2019) rainfall manipulation experiment in 12 0.48-ha field enclosures and found that moderate rainfall increases during the early rather than late growing season advanced the timing of peak reproduction and drove marked increases in population size through increasing the biomass of preferred plant species. By contrast, greatly increased rainfall produced no further increases in vole population growth due to the potential negative effect of the flooding of burrows. The increases in vole population size were more coupled with increased reproduction of overwintered voles and increased body mass of young-of-year than with better survival. Our results provide experimental evidence for the fitness consequences of phenological mismatches at the population level and highlight the importance of rainfall timing on the population dynamics of small herbivores in the steppe grassland environment.

Flood risk However, it is increasingly evident that the stationarity assumption of these analyses does not hold as anthropogenic climate change could shift a site's hydroclimate beyond the range of historical behaviors. We employ nonstationary flood frequency models using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to model changing flood risk for select seasons at twelve National Parks across the U.S. In this GEV model, the location and/or scale parameters of the distribution are allowed to change as a function of time-variable covariates. We use historical precipitation and modeled flows from the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), a land-surface model that simulates land-atmosphere fluxes using water and energy balance equations, as covariates to fit a best nonstationary GEV model to each site. We apply climate model projections of precipitation and VIC flows to these models to obtain future flood probability estimates. Our model results project a decrease in flood risk for sites in the southwestern U.S. region and an increase in flood risk for sites in northern and eastern regions of the U.S. for the selected seasons. The methods and results presented will enable the NPS to develop strategies to ensure public safety and efficient infrastructure management and planning in a nonstationary climate.

The outcomes from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and land use and land cover (LULC) analysis have been incorporated into a hydrological and environmental modeling framework to characterize how climate variability and urbanization can affect the local hydrology and environment at the BRW. The combined impacts of future climate and LULC change are also evaluated relative to the historical baseline conditions. For modeling exercises, Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) is used in parallel computing and statistical techniques, including spatial downscaling and bias correlation, are employed to evaluate climate consequences derived from GCMs as well. The implications of climate variability and land use change driven by urbanization are then observed to evaluate how these overall global challenges can affect water quantity and quality conditions at the BRW. The results show the combined impacts of both climate change and urbanization can lead to more seasonal variability of streamflow (from -27.5% to 12.5%) and water quality, including sediment (from -36.5% to 49.3%), nitrogen (from -24% to 124.2%), and phosphorus (from -13.3% to 21.2%) during summer and early fall over the next several decades.

Currently, approximately one-third of Australia is owned and managed by Indigenous people, including 84% of the Northern Territory coastline, making Indigenous-led and cross-cultural research highly relevant. Recently, the Yolnu Senior Knowledge Custodians of the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area in northern Australia expressed concern about the dieback of culturally significant coastal Melaleuca (paperbark) stands. A partnership between Senior Knowledge Custodians and Western scientists was used to develop an ecocultural research framework to investigate the dieback. Semistructured interviews about the likely causes were conducted with Senior Knowledge Custodians of five coastal flood plain sites where dieback occurred. At these sites, comparative ecological assessments of paired dieback and healthy Melaleuca stands were conducted to explore relationships between Melaleuca stand health, salt water intrusion, acid sulfate soils and feral ungulate damage. Melaleuca dieback was observed in three species: nambarra (M. viridiflora), ranan (M. cajuputi) and gulun'kulun (M. acacioides). The sociocultural and ecological research approaches similarly suggested that similar to 70% of Melaleuca spp. dieback was attributed to combinations of salinity and feral ungulate damage. An ecocultural approach heightened understanding of Melaleuca dieback because we detected similarities and differences in likely causal factors.

Microbes are key players in ecosystem functionality, supporting the supply of ecosystem services that glacier systems provide. The interaction between surface and groundwaters in glacier forefields has only recently gained much attention, and how these interactions influence the microbiology is still unclear. Here, we identify the microbial communities in groundwater from shallow (<15 m deep) boreholes in a glacial forefield floodplain ('sandur') aquifer at different distances from the rapidly retreating Virkisjokull glacier, Iceland, and with varying hydraulic connectivity with the glacial meltwater river that flows over the sandur. Groundwater communities are shown to differ from those in nearby glacial and non-glacial surface water communities. Groundwater-meltwater interactions and groundwater flow dynamics affect the microbial community structure, leading to different microbial communities at different sampling points in the glacier forefield. Groundwater communities differ from those in nearby glacial and non-glacial surface waters. Functional potential for microbial nitrogen and methane cycling was detected, although the functional gene copy numbers of specific groups were low.

We briefly describe the response of invertebrate assemblages to an extreme flood event in 2018 in the western Ehime Prefecture of Japan. We compared invertebrate data collected in past regional-scale surveys with those gathered by revisiting 27 study sites after the flood and examined the relationship between catchment characteristics and the invertebrate response across the study area. Heavy rainfall was recorded in the catchment of each study site during the flood (range 565-1081 mm). Stream invertebrates may be eliminated by the historical flood, although the degree was small compared with that in previous reports on the effects of severe flood disturbances (abundance - 19.1%, taxon richness - 9.0%), likely owing to the absence of severe bed disturbance. Our results imply that high primary productivity, possibly caused by low elevations and the development of farms, accelerated the recovery of invertebrates after the disturbance. They also suggest that assembling pre-disturbance data is the key to understanding the impact of extreme floods on stream invertebrates and managing stream ecosystems during climate change.

Past and future changes of the Austrian climate - Importance for tourism	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Tourism; Global warming; Extreme events; Temperature; Snow cover	SNOW PRODUCTION; SWISS ALPS; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; MODEL; LANDSLIDES; SCENARIOS; PATTERNS; DURATION; RAINFALL	The paper summarizes changes of the climate conditions in Austria impacting tourism as part of an extended literature review. The holistic approach of the study enabled to establish the physical links between emissions created by touristic activities and resultant climate responses. Since the end of the 19th century, air temperature in Austria increased in all elevations by 1.8 degrees C (+20% compared to the global land areas). Depending on the scenario, a further increase of less than 2 degrees C ("Paris target") to 4 degrees C ("worst-case scenario"; RCP 8.5) is expected until the year 2100, which means that the number of hot days either will stabilize at the current level ("Paris Target") or current extreme years will become the new normal at the end of the century ("worst-case scenario"). Regarding snow, as the basic requirement for winter tourism, the natural snow cover duration and snow depth decreased especially in western and southern Austria. Depending on the elevation, a further decline of 10% to 40% ("Paris target") and 50% to 90% ("worst-case scenario"), respectively, is projected until the year 2100. Sustained warming also reduces the time slots for technical snow production in all elevations. More frequent severe thunderstorms and related small-scale phenomena such as heavy precipitation, hail, squalls, small-scale floods and mudflow avalanches are to be expected to increase, especially in the worst-case scenario. Climate change effects emerge progressively in observation-based tourism-climate indicators and more sustained impacts are projected for the future. The magnitude of climate risks in the second half of the 21st century can be substantially reduced by rapid, global climate mitigation and adaptation measures. Management implications: Climatological boundary conditions in Austria have already changed and more profound, human induced changes are expected in future, further increasing impacts relevant for tourism in all seasons of the year. The following implications for tourism management can be deduced from this study: Sector-specific, immediate and effective climate mitigation and adaptation measures are required to substantially reduce the magnitude of the major tourism relevant climate risks (recession of snow, ice and permafrost; heat stress; thunderstorms and related local extreme events; drought events) in the second half of the 21st century. Site- and sector-specific, tailored studies based on downscaled and bias-corrected regional climate model output should be performed to help analyze current and future business-related climate risks together with national climate service providers. Systematic, coordinated and sector-specific awareness raising for climate change and its causes and impacts is needed to ensure acceptance and increase effectivity of mitigation and adaptation measures both for people working in tourism and the guests. Targeted operational meteorological early warning systems need to be designed and locally implemented (heat stress; thunderstorms and related local extreme events).

Aspects such as the subsurface setting and susceptibility to hazards offer insights to resolve risks that are expected to worsen with climate change. Geoscience data were collated from field investigation and other sources for spatial integration using geographic information system software. The information on engineering ground conditions and susceptibility to geohazards was then combined to demarcate zones that are suitable for urban development. This approach can be applied to other cities so that relevant geoscience information is integrated for planning and decision making in a changing climate. The findings reveal that 20% of the city has high suitability for development and is generally not prone to climate hazards. About 80% of the land area in Kuala Lumpur has medium to high ground constraint, and this includes around 25% of the city area that is susceptible to landslides and floods. In the worst-case scenario where no action is taken, communities and urban assets within these susceptible areas would be exposed and vulnerable to more landslides and floods due to climate change. Additional development should be limited in such areas, and where already developed, targeted hazard-specific measures can be taken to build resilience.

J	Shehzad, K				Shehzad, Khurram			Extreme flood in Pakistan: Is Pakistan paying the cost of climate change? A short communication	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Global warming; Environmental degradation; Temperature; Floods; Pakistan	VULNERABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; PUNJAB	Global warming is one of the foremost causes of changes in climate patterns around the world. Pakistan is among the top ten countries affected by global warming. Today, Pakistan is facing severe consequences of global warming in the form of an extreme flood. It affected 33 million people, destroyed 1.5 million homes, and caused $2.3 billion in crop damage. It has also damaged more than 2000 km of roads, cutting off connectivity to provinces and major cities. Thus, inflation in Pakistan has reached its highest level, i.e. 26 % - 27 %, and a severe food crisis is not far away. Recently, Pakistan noted a record temperature of 40 degrees C in several territories, notably 51 degrees C in Jacobabad. The study reported that high temperatures, melting glaciers, heavy monsoon rains, government inattention, and poor governance are the key reasons of this severe flood. Moreover, in 2080, the average temperature in Pakistan is predicted to increase by 4.38 degrees Celsius. The study suggested that Supply of cheap seeds and fertilizers to farmers, maintenance of water supply infrastructure, availability of food and medicines through domestic and foreign assistance, and reduction of electricity rates and taxes in flood-affected areas can be the solution to stop this crisis. Similarly, building dams, investing in technology and training, and educating the general public about environmental change should be included in the longterm goals to avoid future disasters.

The Balearic Islands are a flood-prone region with the research area, Soller (Mallorca) being no exception. Between 1900 and 2000, Soller experienced 48 flash floods with 17 categorised as catastrophic. In Soller, the local surface water network comprises ephemeral streams. These are natural water networks that only carry water during periods of intense rainfall. Using the available evidence from the 1974 flash flood, this research used Flood Modeller to simulate the event. The research developed a one-dimensional (1D) and a one-dimensional two-dimensional (1D-2D) model that assisted in the understanding of the behaviour of the ephemeral stream during the flood. Analysis of hydraulic parameters such as water flow, depth and velocity provided an appreciation of the interaction between the channel and floodplain. Model development aims to forecast the impending impacts of climate change and urbanisation.The results suggest that the characteristics of Soller's catchment area naturally encourage flash flooding and hence can be deemed a flashy catchment. The model demonstrates that the interaction between the channel and floodplain relies heavily on surface roughness of both areas. The model proves that if flood intensity increases with climate change, the extent of flooding and consequently the damage will become more severe.

Loss of reservoirs' storage capacity has a significant impact on the management of their water resources, including flood protection and counteracting the effects of drought and the possibility of producing electricity. The paper presents changes in the capacity of 47 reservoirs in Poland that have the status of key objects of protection against floods and hydrological drought. Based on the collected, unpublished data, the changes in capacity from the beginning of the reservoirs' existence to 31 March 2021 were calculated, which allowed us to determine the total amount of lost capacity and the pace of the processes taking place. From the beginning of operation (average operation time 48 years), the capacity has decreased by about 5%, which means that almost 200 million m(3) less water is stored. Detailed analyses of the lost capacity also allowed for an illustrative presentation of forecasts for further changes in the short and long term. The results obtained represent a unique contribution to future national strategies for the management of sediment and reservoirs' flood reserve and reduction of drought. The presentation of this problem seems to be important also in the context of climate change.

This scenario could lead to the exposure of plants to various stresses. Anion channels are confirmed as the key factors in plant stress responses, which exist in the green lineage plants. Numerous studies on anion channels have shed light on their protein structure, ion selectivity and permeability, gating characteristics, and regulatory mechanisms, but a great quantity of questions remain poorly understand. Here, we review function of plant anion channels in cell signaling to improve plant response to environmental stresses, focusing on climate change related abiotic stresses. We investigate the molecular response and evolution of plant slow anion channel, aluminum-activated malate transporter, chloride channel, voltage-dependent anion channel, and mechanosensitive-like anion channel in green plant. Furthermore, comparative genetic and bioinformatic analysis reveal the conservation of these anion channel gene families. We also discuss the tissue and stress specific expression, molecular regulation, and signaling transduction of those anion channels. We propose that anion channels are essential players for green plants to adapt in a diverse environment, calling for more fundamental and practical studies on those anion channels towards sustainable food production and ecosystem health in the future.

This paper sets out to analyse the livelihood status of the urban poor in a regular situation and a situation under stress due to urban flood in Dhaka city. Two urban poor settlements were surveyed; 400 households were interviewed. It was found that the urban poor households had different types of livelihood capitals at different levels which expressed the livelihood status of the households. In a normal situation, slum dwellers were living with a moderate level of livelihood status, which dropped down to a poor level during a stressed period. The store of capitals of households influenced the capacity of a household to cope with stressed situations because adaptive capacity and sensitivity were controlled by the stock of capitals. Capitals were influencing each other internally, which produced differences in livelihood status among households in both normal and stressed situations. The geographical setting, intensive flooding, poor socio-economic conditions, and lack of collective actions profoundly increased the vulnerability of slum dwellers. These findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to improve capital assets, particularly human capital and social capital, for increasing the capabilities of the urban poor to reduce poverty and to cope with periods of crisis.

The appraisal of household vulnerability and capacity to adapt under climate change is therefore crucial for developing effective disaster risk reduction policies. This study explored the nexus between vulnerability and capacity of rural drought-prone households using survey data of 400 respondents from northern Bangladesh. Through extensive rigorous literature review, 22 and 25 indicators were employed to develop the vulnerability and capacity index, respectively. Co-occurrence network analysis was employed to show the nexus among different classes of capacity and vulnerability. Spearman correlation was also performed to analyze the nexus between vulnerability and capacity. The results reveal that households' vulnerability varies across livelihood assets (human, social, financial, physical, and natural), but capacity follows a similar distribution pattern. A significant negative association was found between vulnerability and adaptive capacity, whereas the strong correlations between social and human capital, human and financial capital, social and financial capital, and physical and natural capital were identified in this study. Future projection (up to 2024) using support vector machine algorithm shows that overall drought adaptive capacity will increase, while vulnerability will decrease. The outcomes of this study would help planners and policy-makers in planning and taking proper initiatives that might be useful for adopting efficient disaster risk reduction strategies.

We use a modelling chain whose outputs are familiar and used operationally, for example to issue flood warnings. With two different versions of a hydrological model, we show that (1) the higher spatial resolution between the global and regional climate model is necessary to realistically simulate the high spatial variability of precipitation in this mountainous region and (2) only with hourly data are we able to capture the fast flood-generating processes leading to the peak streamflow. The higher resolution regional atmospheric model captures the fact that with the passage of an atmospheric river, some valleys receive high amounts of precipitation and others not, while the coarser resolution global model shows uniform precipitation in the whole region. Translating the event into the future leads to similar results: while in some catchments, a future flood might be much larger than a present one, in others no event occurs as the atmospheric river simply does not hit that catchment. The use of an operational flood warning system for future events is expected to facilitate stakeholder engagement.

Effects of disturbances and environmental changes on an aridland riparian generalist	PEERJ			English	Article						Climate change; Conservation; Microhabitat; Noninvasive; Reptiles; Telemetry; Thamnophis; Desert; Gartersnake; Drought	THAMNOPHIS-CYRTOPSIS SERPENTES; HABITAT USE; SPATIAL ECOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GARTER SNAKES; CONSERVATION; REINTRODUCTION; BEHAVIOR; VULNERABILITY; REPRODUCTION	Anthropogenic climate change and ecosystem disturbances can detrimentally affect habitats and species. Areas with concentrated biodiversity, such as aridland riparian zones, often yield the greatest number of vulnerable species. A better understanding of ecological and environmental relationships can guide more effective conservation strategies. We used both visual transects and external (tape) radio telemetry to study the behavioral and spatial ecology of black-necked gartersnakes (Thamnophis cyrtopsis; n = 81)-a dietary generalist yet aquatic habitat specialist-in a heterogenous aridland riparian zone of lower Sabino Canyon, Tucson, Arizona, between 2018 and 2021. Our objectives were to (1) understand how extrinsic conditions influence population ecology dynamics, including immediately prior to and after major disturbances and environmental extremes; (2) analyze behavioral activity and microhabitat usage in relation to environmental factors; and (3) assess the efficacy of a less-invasive telemetry strategy. Between late spring 2020 and early summer 2021, ecosystem disturbances included near-record heat and drought, wildfire, and low overwinter precipitation. Many aquatic habitats either completely dried or were spatially disjunct; gartersnake prey species were noticeably sparse. Extreme drought rapidly shifted to excessive flooding during the 2021 monsoon that brought above-average streamflow magnitude and duration. Between 2019 and 2021, we observed a dramatic decline in T. cyrtopsis; odds of detection reduced by 92.8% (CI [56.0-99.1%]). Strong spatiotemporal links relative to the extent and timing of available surface water appear important. Prior to the onset of monsoonal stream recharge in early summer, shallow and drying aquatic habitats are used as parturition sites and foraging grounds; all age classes took advantage to corral fishes trapped in isolated and shrinking pools. Ambient conditions had varying effects on gartersnake behaviors. Variation in microhabitat assemblages occurred with distance from water, activity level, and developmental age class. Interestingly, associations remained consistent across seasons and years, which suggests a reliance on heterogenous habitat structure. Sampling techniques complemented each other, however, bioclimatic parameters rendered limitations and should be considered in methodological decisions. Overall, disadvantageous responses to major disturbances and climatic extremes by a presumably adaptable generalist like T. cyrtopsis are concerning. Insights from long-term monitoring of responses by common yet environmentally sensitive species such as T. cyrtopsis may serve to more broadly highlight demographic challenges that other taxa with similar semi-aquatic life histories may face in changing systems. Such information could inform more effective conservation management strategies in warming and drying ecosystems.

Nature-based solutions such as urban greenspace rehabilitation programs are gaining considerable attention for restoring soil re-tention capacity and protecting cities against increasing flood risk. However, a better understanding of how effective such measures are in practice is needed to enable and promote their adoption across urban settings. To this end, in this study, we assess the effect of soil rehabilitation measures in terms of soil compaction, vegeta-tion cover and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by analysing the results of an infiltration measurement cam-paign conducted across a wide range of real-world greenspaces (from recently rehabilitated, to poorly maintained, down to highly degraded) in the Italian city of Milan, one of the most urbanized areas in Europe. Our results show that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity varies significantly across the examined greenspaces, due to differences in time from rehabilitation, soil compaction and vegetation cover. Specifically, we find that the highest unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is obtained after approximately 5 years since imple-mentation of soil rehabilitation measures, which can be explained by the time needed (i) by the introduced veg-etation to develop root systems, and (ii) by the soil matrix to develop a coherent structure that allows stable connections between pores and thus the strengthening of preferential water pathways. Finally, our study shows that, in absence of soil and vegetation maintenance, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity may decrease rap-idly after about 9-12 years. These findings provide useful information for supporting the planning of nature-based solutions in practice, which will become increasingly important to protect our cities from climate change impacts and widespread ur-banization going forwards.

The method allowed for the identification of the CC, AC, and TC parameters that can be easily converted into qualitative-quantitative variables. Among all parameters, the method focused on multi-stakeholder and civil society engagement, which is representative of TC and variable relating to the risk perception and awareness, the urban space perception, or the people's ability to activate bottom-up urban transformation processes within resilient development pathways. Therefore, qualitative tools such as collaborative mapping and co-design processes, pertaining to the urban planning and design fields, and quantitative tools such as surveys, from the social science field, were harmonized and combined to collect and analyze data on these site-specific topics. Considering people's priorities and needs, the study was useful to define shared sustainable and resilient solutions in order to holistically integrate Disaster Risk Reduction/Climate Change Adaptation urban planning and design approaches and simultaneously deliver social, environmental, and economic co-benefits.

Tidal barriers and fish - Impacts and remediation in the face of increasing demand for freshwater and climate change	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						River; Estuary; Hydrodynamics; Fishway; Environmental flows; Diadromy	VERTICAL-SLOT FISHWAY; ARGYROSOMUS-JAPONICUS SCIAENIDAE; EEL ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; ESTUARINE FISH; LIFE-HISTORY; FLOW REQUIREMENTS; COASTAL FISHES; BROWN TROUT; SEA-LEVEL; RIVER	Worldwide, tidal barriers (e.g. barrages, dikes, tide gates) are constructed in the lower reaches and estuaries of rivers to limit saltwater incursion into upstream freshwater reserves, facilitate water diversion and abstraction, limit flooding, reclaim land and generate electricity. While performing these functions, tidal barriers also affect fish through: 1) reduced connectivity; 2) loss of tidal flux; 3) conversion of upstream estuarine habitats to freshwater; and 4) diminished freshwater discharge, which compresses the spatio-temporal salinity regime of downstream estuarine habitats. As such, tidal barriers commonly cause declines of diadromous and estuarine associated fish species, with a subsequent loss of ecosystem services. These impacts will be exacerbated as climate change promotes sea-level rise and alters freshwater flow regimes and will be amplified by increasing demands for freshwater by a growing human population. As a result, more tidal barriers are likely. Nevertheless, in estuaries with tidal barriers, management that promotes connectivity and more natural ecosystem function is increasing but remains complex from ecological, economic and engineering perspectives. We present case studies from the Netherlands, southeastern United States and southern Australia to characterise impacts on fishes in different biogeographical regions and document contemporary approaches to restoring ecosystem function and fish populations in systems with tidal barriers. To meet these goals, we suggest three key considerations for future research and management are provision of fish passage, reinstating tidal flux and delivering environ-mental flows.

This will cause the water supply of these areas to become very difficult in times of crisis. This study identifies sub-basins with high flood potential in the baseline period (1982-2005) and the future period (2025-2048) in the Hablehroud basin, north-central Iran. It uses the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and 23 coupled model intercomparison project 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). It estimates the instantaneous peak flow (IPF) and uses a flood index (FI) to determine the contributions of each sub-basin to the floods. The rainfall of the basin will increase by 11.5% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 12.6% under RCP 8.5. The minimum daily temperature (Tmin) of the basin will increase by 0.8 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 1.1 degrees C under RCP 8.5 in the future period. In addition, the maximum daily temperature (Tmax) will rise by 1 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 1.2 degrees C under RCP 8.5. Moreover, basin runoff will increase by 6.4% under RCP 4.5 and 11.6% under RCP 8.5. The results indicate that the central and southern sub-basins made the most significant contribution to floods in the baseline period, while the eastern sub-basins will make the most considerable contribution to future floods.

This paper explores this challenge in the case of Chennai, India, a city which, in recent years, has faced several climate related disasters, including floods. Building on an innovative combination of research methods (policy documents analysis, stakeholder interviews, and a community workshop), the study analyses the barriers and explores potentials for operationalising socio-ecological resilience in Chennai in the face of an ongoing conflict between rapid urbanisation and the natural water system, compromising the region's hydrological capacity and resilience to flooding. In particular, drawing on the notion of evolutionary resilience and multi-level approach, the paper investigates (1) the scope for developing an integrated vision for resilience of the Chennai region (macro level); (2) the presence and the capacity of institutions to connect the different stakeholders and mediate their interests (meso level); and (3) the barriers and potentials developing local adaptation strategies in a bottom-up manner (micro level). The study sheds light on the under-researched issue of socio-ecological resilience in Chennai, while identifying potentials for implementing it through a combination of top down and bottom-up approaches, which in turn provides useful lessons for planning for resilience in other cities in the Global South.

A case study in Campinas Metropolitan Area (Sao Paulo, Brazil)	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Climate change; Urban Flooding; Disaster Risk Reduction; Storm-runoff	DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES; LAND-USE CHANGE; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; RUNOFF GENERATION; SURFACE RUNOFF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IDF CURVES; INTENSITY	This paper highlights the effects of sealed surfaces in flood hazard in order to identify population exposure to heavy rain within Cabras watershed located in Campinas Metropolitan Area (Sao Paulo). We applied a set of methods compiled into an integrated system by the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of University of Sao Paulo (USP). We observed that, for relatively frequent flood events with 10y of return periods, changes in LULC represent an increase of maximum water depths that vary up to 0,036 m to 0,043 m, respectively. For less frequent events, with return periods of 100y, the maximum increase of water depth varies from 0,064 m to 0,071 m. Although the water depth reached is not considered risky (e.g., for an adult walking in flows), the water velocity (v = 2,32 m/s) and the amount of water downhill (similar to 5,000 litters) are considered high (i.e. pedestrians can be swept along streets during major storm events).

A Waterfront View of Coastal Hazards: Contextualizing Relationships among Geographic Exposure, Shoreline Type, and Hazard Concerns among Coastal Residents	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						coastal hazards; stakeholder decision-making; coastal management; hurricanes; climate adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; EROSION; MANAGEMENT	Coastal communities exist on the front lines of diverse natural hazards and the growing impacts of climate change. While traditional strategies for dealing with coastal hazards have often involved the hardening or armoring of shorelines, more recent research and practice have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of "living shorelines" and other ecosystem-based strategies for coastal protection. To explore potential relationships among geographic exposure (waterfront vs. inland), shoreline condition (armored vs. natural), and hazard concerns, we surveyed 583 waterfront and inland residents in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We found that overall concern for coastal hazards was similar across waterfront and inland residents, as well as among residents with both armored and natural shorelines. However, concern for specific hazards differed across these groups. Waterfront residents were significantly more concerned about major hurricanes and erosion than inland residents. Conversely, inland residents were more concerned with drought and flooding than waterfront residents. Among waterfront residents, specific hazard concerns were similar between residents with natural and armored shorelines with two key exceptions. Residents with armored shorelines reported higher concern for erosion and sea level rise than residents with natural shorelines. Our results suggest that armored shorelines do not necessarily alleviate concerns about coastal hazards. In the context of balancing social and ecological objectives in addressing coastal hazards or adapting to climate change, understanding the perceptions and behaviors of coastal residents is essential for conserving and protecting coastal ecosystems along residential shorelines.

Seasonal water quality and trophic status of shallow lentic waters and their association with water levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate variability; Drought; Hydro-ecological dynamic; Lakes; Tropical limnology	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; SURFACE-WATER; LAKE; PHOSPHORUS; RESERVOIR; FLUCTUATIONS; MANAGEMENT	Extreme hydro-climatic changes associated with floods and drought greatly influence the ecosystem dynamic of tropical lakes in Malaysia, resulting in negative impacts on their water quality and trophic status. This study examined the seasonal changes in water quality and trophic state connected to hydro-ecological changes in a natural lake and two reservoirs. Water levels in the three water bodies varied with changes in rainfall regime, and water regulation for irrigation or water supply. Multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant relationship between season and temperature, pH, conductivity, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a (p<0.05). Drought events and the associated period of low water levels were characterized by high temperature, conductivity and chlorophyll-a levels in these shallow lakes, which probably led to high photosynthetic rates with concomitant increase in dissolved oxygen and pH and decrease in total nitrogen concentration. Elevated chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations were also associated with drought events and the decrease in water level in Bukit Merah Reservoir, possibly due to the release of phosphorus from internal loading resulting from sediment re-suspension by wind. Salinity increase in Durian Tunggal Reservoir during dry season was possibly due to seawater intrusion into river. During the rainy season, transparency in Bera Lake and Bukit Merah Reservoir was strongly influenced by the influxes of the main river that transported elevated levels of suspended solids and nutrients.

Simulation of the impact of sea level rise groundwater flooding along the south-eastern coast of India	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Sea level rise; Groundwater inundation; Modeling; Coastal aquifers; Nagapattinam	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER INTRUSION; INUNDATION; CALIFORNIA; AQUIFERS; VULNERABILITY; NAGAPATTINAM; SCENARIOS; FLOW	Sea-level rise affects low-lying coastal regions that jeopardize superficial infrastructure through groundwater flooding, which also impacts near-surface artificial structures, inhumed networks, and near-shore ecosystems. In the present study, groundwater flow modeling has been utilized to simulate different scenarios of sea level rise to evaluate the groundwater level changes and predict possible vulnerable zones to groundwater inundation along the coast of the Nagapattinam district. The model has been simulated for ten years (2010-2019) under the transient condition with MODFLOW-2000 engine in Visual MODFLOW. Calibration and validation of the simulated model have been performed by trial-and-error method considering groundwater heads of selected observations well data, which results in a root mean square value of 1.765 m, 0.941 as correlation coefficient, and a value of 0.687 m as the standard error. Groundwater flooding due to a 0.6 m sea level rise is forecasted to cause significant flooding, covering 23.83% of the study area. A 1.0 m rise in sea level impacts 26.2% of the study region. The sea level rise scenarios evaluate that the coastal groundwater heads will reduce as they are restricted by topography from rising landward. The present study suggests groundwater in the coastal regions is influenced by sea level rise due to climate change impacting the coastal ecosystems.	[Ramesh, K.; Srinivasamoorthy, K.; Kanna, A.

However, flood research in Tianshan Mountains, a typical flood-prone mountainous region in China, is still insufficient. Here, we customized a set of flood research methods based on rainstorms and extreme snowmelt events, including a new flood counting method that comprehensively considered the frequency and magnitude of floods and the methods of flood classification and change attribution. We found that floods around the Chinese Tianshan Mountains (CTM) increased from 2014 to 2016 but decreased rapidly from 2016 to 2021, with storm floods, snowmelt floods, and mixed floods accounting for 38.3 %, 26.5 %, and 34.6 % of total flood events, respectively. The variation of floods was most significantly correlated with the average and extreme precipitation, followed by the temperature-driven average snowmelt change. Furthermore, atmospheric circulation anomalies and water vapor input from the western boundary of CTM caused decreasing precipitation and storm floods. Meanwhile, the warming hiatus also greatly impacted declining flood frequency. Notably, flood frequency is projected to rebound soon because of the rising precipitation and temperature, infrastructure aging, and reservoir abandonment, implying the present flood decline unsustainable. Our research develops a strategy to investigate short-term flood anomalies under climate oscillations around the CTM, providing insights into flood research and prevention in global mountainous regions.

Climate Gentrification: Valuing Perceived Climate Risks in Property Prices	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article							REAL-ESTATE PRICES; SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLOOD-RISK; EXTREME EVENTS; HOUSE PRICES; INSURANCE; WILDFIRE; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; LOSSES	There is growing evidence that physical climate hazards-such as floods and wildfires-affect property prices. Climate change scenarios suggest more frequent and severe physical climate hazards in the future, coinciding with greater exposure of populations to such threats. This raises concern because changes in property prices pose risks to homeowners' financial status, as well as to the insurance and mortgage industries, bank portfolios, and thereby financial systems. We begin with a new definition of climate gentrification (CG) that captures links between physical climate hazards, perceptions of risk and resilience, and capital flows in property markets. This is followed by a structured assessment of the key drivers of CG, and an empirical case study of property data for a flood-prone UK city to demonstrate how CG depressed house price growth over the period from 2005 to 2018 by up to 50 percent in flood-exposed (relative to unexposed) locations. We then provide a discussion of ethical concerns around CG research, with suggested ways forward. Such price signals have potential ramifications for the long-term stability of real estate markets and raise policy implications for private and public sectors. We conclude with some priorities for further research into CG, recognizing key information and data gaps, and noting how existing knowledge and tools could contribute toward improved resilience to climate change. Key Words: climate gentrification, climate hazards, flood, hedonic model, property prices.

To understand and mitigate such events, it is crucial to investigate their spatio-temporal variations globally or regionally. Global precipitation products provide an alternative way to the in situ observations over such a region. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of the latest version of the Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (GPM-IMERGV6.0 Final Run (GPM-IMERGF)). To this end, we have employed ten most common extreme precipitation indices, including maximum indices (Rx1day, Rx5day, CDD, and CWD), percentile indices (R95pTOT and R99pTOT), and absolute threshold indices (R10mm, R20mm, SDII, and PRCPTOT). Overall, the spatial distribution results for error metrics showed that the highest and lowest accuracy for GPM-IMERGF were reported for the absolute threshold indices and percentile indices, respectively. Considering the spatial distribution of the results, the highest accuracy of GPM-IMERGF in capturing extreme precipitations was observed over the western highlands, while the worst results were obtained along the Caspian Sea regions. Our analysis can significantly contribute to various hydro-metrological applications for the study region, including identifying drought and flood-prone areas and water resources planning.

Global warming and climate change extensively influence both the quantity and temporal characteristics of peak discharge in northern rivers by altering snowpack accumulation and melt processes. This study analyzed peak spring flood discharge (PSFD) magnitude (PSFDM) and timing (PSFDT) in four natural rivers (Simojoki, Kuivajoki, Kiiminkijoki, and Temmesjoki) across northern Finland, in terms of long-term (1967-2011) variability, trends, and links to large-scale climate teleconnections. The PSFDM significantly (p < 0.05) declined in the Simojoki, Kuivajoki, and Kiiminkijoki rivers over time. Both the Simojoki and Kuivajoki rivers also experienced significant decreasing trends of about -0.33 and -0.3 (days year(-1)), respectively, in the PSFDT during 1967-2011. In these two rivers, the less and earlier PSFDs were principally attributable to the warmer spring seasons positively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in recent decades. Moreover, daily precipitation time series corresponding to the PSFD events showed no considerable effects on PSFDM and PSFDT changes in all the natural rivers studied. This suggests that less and earlier historical PSFDs in natural rivers at higher latitudes in northern Finland were primarily induced by warmer springtime temperatures influencing snowpack dynamics.

However, the potential to initiate such a transformative approach has not materialized because of the many underlying issues that need to be understood properly. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review to gather empirical evidence on the issues and challenges in implementing risk-sensitive urban development. The study identified forty-six issues and challenges under seven key themes that need addressing in order to facilitate the desirable transition: trade-offs, governance, fragmentation and silos, capacity, design and development, data, and funding. The issues and challenges that exist under trade-offs for negotiating solutions for risk-sensitive urban development and the governance of multiple stakeholders were identified as the top two areas that need attention in facilitating the desirable transition. This study also revealed that important information, such as scientific information, hazard and risk information, temporal and spatial information, and critical local details are not being produced and shared between stakeholders in decision-making. A profound participatory process that involves all the stakeholders in the decision-making process was identified as the pathway to ensure equitable outcomes in risk-sensitive urban development.

For example, the dynamics of floodplain fisheries are governed both by inundation dynamics across thousands of km(2), and water storage timing within small depressions (which serve as fish habitat) connected to the river network by meter-scale manmade canals, controlled by flow across fishing weirs. Here, we propose to represent these features as a system of effective, interconnected sub-grid elements within a coarse-scale model. We test this strategy over the Logone floodplain in Cameroon, and its floodplain fishery. We first validate this strategy for a local study area (30 km(2)); we find that hydraulic models at resolutions from 30 m to 500 m are able to reproduce hydraulic dynamics as documented by in situ water level observations. When applied to the entire floodplain (16,000 km(2)), we find that the proposed modeling strategy allows accurate prediction of observed pattern of recession in the depressions. Artificially removing floodplain canals in the model causes residence time of water in depressions to be overpredicted by approximately 30 days. This study supports the strategy of modeling fine-scale interconnected features as a system of sub-grid elements in a coarse resolution model for applications such as assessing the sensitivity of floodplain fisheries to future climate change.

From EU Directives to Local Stormwater Discharge Permits: A Study of Regulatory Uncertainty and Practice Gaps in Denmark	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						stormwater management; water framework directive (WFD); floods directive (FD); top-down and bottom-up implementation; polycentric regulation; coordination of measures; urban drainage; natural recipients; water quality	POLLUTION; WATER; MANAGEMENT; SEDIMENT; SEPARATE	Climate changes and urbanization push cities to redesign their drainage systems, which may increase separate stormwater discharges to local recipients. In the EU, regulation of these is governed by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Floods Directive, but national implementation varies and is often supplemented with local non-legislative guidelines. By reviewing trends and discrepancies in the Danish regulation practice for separated stormwater discharges, this article investigates how the directives are put into effect. A legislative gap for separate stormwater discharges introduces uncertainty in the discharge permit conditions, which especially affect conditions targeting water quality. We point to several topics to be addressed, e.g., the level at which the regulation of separate stormwater discharges takes place, opportunities for coordination with flood risk and climate change adaptation initiatives, as well as uncertainties regarding the application of Best Available Techniques. Working with these issues would elevate the regulation practice and aid regulators in reaching a more holistic and consistent approach, thus improving chances of reaching the desired recipient status before or after the WFD deadline in 2027. This could be undertaken at river basin, river basin district or national level, but there is also potential for harvesting mutual benefits by addressing these challenges internationally.

As abrupt changes to baseflow can occur via climate change and human disturbances, understanding the effects of baseflow on IAMF behavior can provide insight into how groundwater alterations and climate change can impact flood risk assessment, particularly for regional data aggregation. We thus seek to quantify baseflow impacts across the flood frequency curve considering a top down approach enumerating the differential impacts of baseflow (as Baseflow Index) across the IAMF flood frequency curve and then analyzing the impact of baseflow at the event-scale. Results show that baseflow exerts significant influence over the entire flood frequency curve, showing a slight increase in effect with higher return period flows. At the event-scale, the permeability of the catchment (proxied by baseflow rate during rising limb), significantly impacted the variability in IAMF and had more of an effect than antecedent moisture of the catchment (proxied by antecedent discharge). Furthermore, the effects of each of the event-scale variables changed across climate regions and return periods, suggesting that changes to climate and groundwater abstractions would greatly affect the flood frequency curve.

Residents' participation is the main driving force of GI implementation. Based on semi-structured interviews, GIS spatial analysis, and multiple regression, we investigated residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in public and private space and identified the influence factors in Shanghai, China. The results show that, compared with private space, residents prefer to implement GI in public space, where they have different preferences of GI measures. On urban scale, residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in private space is characterized as "high in the inner city, low in the suburban areas", while the spatial difference is insignificant for public space. In addition, the factors affecting residents' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI are different in private and public space. The deterministic factors of GI participation are gender, education level, and floor for private space, while only include building age for public space, in addition to the common factors of free time, cognition of GI, perception of pluvial flood risk, supportive factors, and environment-improving factors that can influence both private and public space GI participation. Our analysis therefore provides valuable information for policymakers concerning nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation and urban sustainability.

Urban greening (UG) is an excellent option for mitigating flood risk and excess urban heat. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems can cope with plant irrigation needs and urban water management. In this study, we investigated how UG and RWH work together to mitigate environmental risks. By incorporating a new RWH module into the urban ecohydrological model Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), we tested different uses of intervention approaches for 28 cities in the USA, spanning a variety of climates, population densities, and urban landscapes. UT&C was forced by the latest generation convection-permitting climate model simulations of the current (2001-2011) and end-of-century (RCP8.5) climate. Our results showed that neither UG nor RWH, through the irrigation of vegetation, could significantly contribute to mitigating the expected strong increase in 2 m urban canyon temperatures under a high-emission scenario. RWH alone can sufficiently offset the intensifying surface flood risk, effectively enhance water saving, and support UG to sustain a strong urban carbon sink, especially in dry regions. However, in these regions, RWH cannot fully fulfill plant water needs, and additional measures to meet irrigation demand are required to maximize carbon sequestration by urban vegetation.

In addition to their role in water supply and hydropower production, their ability to retain water and control the flow makes them a valuable asset for flood mitigation. This is a key function, since extreme events have increased in the last few decades as a result of climate change, and therefore, the application of mechanisms capable of mitigating flood damage will be key in the coming decades. Having a good estimation of the outflow of a reservoir can be an advantage for water management or early warning systems. When historical data are available, data-driven models have been proven a useful tool for different hydrological applications. In this sense, this study analyzes the efficiency of different machine learning techniques to predict reservoir outflow, namely multivariate linear regression (MLR) and three artificial neural networks: multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) and long short-term memory (LSTM). These techniques were applied to forecast the outflow of eight water reservoirs of different characteristics located in the Mino River (northwest of Spain). In general, the results obtained showed that the proposed models provided a good estimation of the outflow of the reservoirs, improving the results obtained with classical approaches such as to consider reservoir outflow equal to that of the previous day. Among the different machine learning techniques analyzed, the NARX approach was the option that provided the best estimations on average.

Threats to freshwater mussels: The interactions of water temperature, velocity and total suspended solids on ecophysiology and growth	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lampsilis siliquoidea; Hydrodynamics; Ecophysiology; Unionid; Multiple stressor	DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; CHLORELLA-VULGARIS; STREAM ECOSYSTEMS; CALORIFIC VALUES; UNIONID MUSSELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD; FLOW; EXPOSURE	Freshwater unionid mussels are ecosystem engineers that are highly endangered in part because of land-use changes that have altered their habitat and negatively impacted their ecophysiology. The environmental factors that affect mussels do not act alone and may be better understood using a multiple-stressor approach. We examine how changes in water temperature, turbidity (total suspended solids; TSS) and water velocity affected the clearance rates (CR), oxygen consumption rates (OC), and resultant scope for growth (SFG) of Lampsilis siliquoidea in laboratory flow chamber experiments. The CR, OC and SFG of L. siliquoidea increased with acclimation temperature and velocity, and decreased with TSS concentration and acute temperature exposure, although these responses were more compli-cated when factors were combined. The primary factor affecting CR and OC varied with acclimation temperature, with warmer temperature and high TSS leading to strong declines in clearance rates. A worst-case scenario would involve a summer season where temperatures and TSS loads are above-average, and water velocities are either below-or above-average, which are likely under increased frequencies of storm, flood, or drought events due to climate change. Conservation measures should focus on protecting aquatic systems during these times and also use a multistressor approach to determine how environmental factors interact in efforts to protect and recover freshwater mussel populations.

The presented approach encompasses: (1) the strategic identification of focal areas in terms of climate adaptation needs, (2) comprehensive diagnosis of local ecological vulnerability and natural adaptive potential to build adaptive capacity, and (3) incorporation of natural adaptive potential through an identified set of planning and design tools. For diagnosis and strategic environmental impact assessment, the multicriteria analysis has been elaborated. The described procedure is applied to the City of Warsaw on the strategic level, by elaboration of the ranking of districts in terms of priority to take adaptation actions based on climatic threats, demographic vulnerability, and assessment of Warsaw Green Infrastructure potential. For further analysis at the planning and design stage, the district with the most urgent adaptation needs has been chosen, and within its borders, two neighborhoods (existing and planned one) with diagnosed ecological sensitivity were selected. Both case studies were analyzed in terms of environmental conditions, urban structure, and planning provisions. It enabled identification of existing natural adaptive potential and assessment of its use. As a result, propositions for enhancing neighborhood resilience to climate change were suggested.

Colony Connectivity and the Rapid Growth of a Caspian Tern (<i>Hydroprogne caspia</i>) Colony on Alaska's Copper River Delta, USA	WATERBIRDS			English	Article						barrier island; breeding colony; breeding dispersal; Caspian Tern; climate change; connectivity; Hydroprogne caspia; immigration; marine heat wave; range expansion		North America's northernmost, sizable colony of Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) is located on the Copper River Delta of south-central Alaska, USA. The colony was monitored in June during 2008-2016 and in July during 2009-2013. This 9-year period coincided with reduction of Caspian Tern nesting habitat at East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary, Oregon, USA, one of the world's largest Caspian Tern breeding colonies. The number of active nests on the Copper River Delta more than doubled during the early study period from 209 in 2008 to 423 in 2013. However, there was a steady decline in the number of nests during 2014 (281) to 2015 (115) and the colony failed in 2016. These declines were likely due to warm sea surface temperature anomalies across the northeastern Pacific Ocean in those years. Based on resightings of banded individuals, colony connectivity was documented between the Copper River Delta and other colonies, ranging from southeast Alaska (215 km) to central California, USA (>3,000 km). The East Sand Island colony was the most important source of immigrants to the Copper River Delta. While the Copper River Delta now serves as important natural breeding habitat for Caspian Terns, increased flooding and severe storms associated with climate change will likely limit colony size and productivity in the long-term.

Environmental issues, such as climate change and ecosystem destruction, pose significant threats to humanity and the planet. Addressing these challenges necessitates sustainable resource management and increased efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technologies present promising solutions in this regard. By harnessing AI and ML, we can collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as remote sensing, smart sensors, and social media. This enables real-time monitoring and decision making in water resource management. AI applications, including irrigation optimization, water quality monitoring, flood forecasting, and water demand forecasting, enhance agricultural practices, water distribution models, and decision making in desalination plants. Furthermore, AI facilitates data integration, supports decision-making processes, and enhances overall water management sustainability. However, the wider adoption of AI in water resource management faces challenges, such as data heterogeneity, stakeholder education, and high costs. To provide an overview of ML applications in water resource management, this research focuses on core fundamentals, major applications (prediction, clustering, and reinforcement learning), and ongoing issues to offer new insights. More specifically, after the in-depth illustration of the ML algorithmic taxonomy, we provide a comparative mapping of all ML methodologies to specific water management tasks. At the same time, we include a tabulation of such research works along with some concrete, yet compact, descriptions of their objectives at hand. By leveraging ML tools, we can develop sustainable water resource management plans and address the world's water supply concerns effectively.

The burgeoning population at present 225 million, which is expected to cross 250 million by 2025 is creating an additional burden on water resources, as per capita availability is depleting sharply from 5,000 m3 in 1951 to 1,100 m3 in 2005, which is expected to fall to 800 m3 by 2025. Pakistan's water demand is increasing at an average yearly rate of 10% which in terms of the area will increase to 338 km3 by 2025, against the availability of 240-258 km3. Out of the available surface water, approximately 74% is extracted, while 83% of the groundwater is used for agricultural and other uses, which is an exceptionally high ratio for a water-scarce country like Pakistan. The adverse impacts of climate change are also causing extreme weather conditions, resulting in drought and floods almost every year. Inadequate water reservoirs, water wastage in agriculture and households, negligible wastewater recycling, and contamination of drinking water are causing health risks that have turned serious national security challenges for Pakistan. This research article argues that surface and subsurface water in Pakistan is depleting sharply, and if not addressed in time, has the potential of becoming the biggest national security problem. The article investigates the available water status in Pakistan covering surface and subsurface resources in detail, including reservoirs for storage, and sectoral utilization, to draw conclusions on water availability and usage requirement. The policy recommendations highlight the effective integration of smart technology in addressing multidimensional water issues and efficient water governance for ensuring water security for the sustainable development of Pakistan.

Although this is an extensively examined area, the application of multidisciplinary studies has proven capable of drawing attention to novel information concerning the depositional environment. Thus, this study aims to reveal climatic and paleoenvironmental changes by using both archive and fresh data drawn from biomarkers, palynology, sedimentology, and geochemistry. The article also addresses the quality, quantity, and thermal maturity of organic matter in relation to hydrocarbon potential. In general, the beginning of Serravallian stage relates to a regression forced by the development of the Antarctic icesheet followed by a pronounced transgression. The results presented here show that the Central Paratethys Sea reacted to the late Badenian (Serravallian) flooding, by an event which triggered a dysoxic, but not euxinic, bottom waters. The climate remained warm and humid, with paratropical to subtropical forests on the continent. Several new depocenters developed during the Sarmatian and divided the depositional environments into a shelfbrake slope in the central part of the Danube Basin, and into deltaic and swamp environments on the basin margins. The climate changed to temperate, leading to the disappearance of subtropical taxa. A shallow lake and swamp environment developed at the beginning of the Pannonian (Tortonian), forcing a salinity decrease connected to the increase in humidity. The degree of hydrocarbon richness of the mudstones is generally fair to good, and the kerogen is of mixed marine-terrestrial origin (II and III). Nonetheless, sediments at the basin margin are clearly immature due to insufficient burial.

Development planning for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment was utilised in the study. Using multi-stage sampling procedure, 193 vegetable farmers in selected sites prominent for vegetable production from Uganda, Ghana and Nigeria were used. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and linear regression at alpha(0.05). Awareness of climate variability and change was high among most respondents from the three countries, but highest among respondents from Uganda (78.3%). Awareness was highest for long dry spell (x over bar = 1.90) and drought (x over bar = 1.81) and lowest for harmful gas emissions (x = 0.76). Changes in climate variability and trends were perceived to be highest in terms of flood volume/damage caused by flood to farmlands in Nigeria (x = 3.85) and Uganda (x = 5.0), but in terms of increased temperature for Ghana (x = 4.93). Impact of climate-related changes on vegetable farming was high in Ghana (98.3%) and Nigeria (46.6%) but low in Uganda (5.0%). Awareness (beta= 0.14), perception (beta = 0.15) use of adaptation strategies (beta= 0.10) and household size (beta = - 0.19) predicted change in perceived impact of climate variability among vegetable farmers. Vegetable farmers in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda are affected differently by climate variability. Farmers in these countries also have different priorities for adaptation strategies. Locality-specific climate adaptation strategies would help ease farmers burden due to climate change.

Bringing the state back in to humanitarian crises response: Disaster governance and challenging collaborations in the 2015 Malawi flood response	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; DROUGHTS; SYSTEMS	Malawi is a disaster-prone country with a long history of flooding. Yet disaster response policies have been largely neglected and disaster risk reduction efforts are mostly donor-led. The 2015 floods showed that Malawi's local and national state institutions struggled to respond adequately. To support the Malawi government, the United Nations implemented its cluster system to coordinate the collaborations between the state, humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations in the disaster response. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with relief intervention participants, we argue that a focus on the localization of aid without explicit attention to the affected state's institutions is problematic in contexts characterized by limited state capacity and overall donor dependency.

J	Asmael, N; Dupuy, A; Mclachlan, P; Franceschi, M				Asmael, Nazeer; Dupuy, Alain; Mclachlan, Paul; Franceschi, Michel			Hydro-Geochemical Characteristics of the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer and Its Potential Artificial Recharge to Sustain the Low Flow of the Garonne River	WATER			English	Article						Garonne River; alluvial aquifer; climate change; water resources management; MAR (managed aquifer recharge); groundwater modeling; France	MAJOR ION CHEMISTRY; HYDROCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; GROUNDWATER; AREA; SCIENCE; BASIN	The complex and interconnected water challenges linked to global climate change and natural and anthropogenic water resources pressure have become major challenges in the 21st century. The Garonne River and its accompanying alluvial aquifers are considered the most important source for agricultural activities in the Garonne Valley, Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region, southwest France. The water is used for irrigation in summer and to reduce frost damage in spring. The alluvial shallow aquifer is recharged by rainfall, lateral inflow from the hillside, and seepage from the riverbed during the flood periods. The aquifer maintains the flow of the river during dry periods. Moreover, the potential recharge of this aquifer is particularly sensitive to annual climatic fluctuations and consequently affects surrounding ecosystems and related socio-economic activities. The increasing impacts of climate change have increased the concern about the availability of these resources. Various adaptation strategies have been considered to mitigate and adapt to the new situation in southwest France. The artificial recharge of the alluvial aquifer is one such regional adaptation strategy to adapt to climate change. The study has two main objectives: to assess the natural and anthropogenic influence on the groundwater chemistry, and to model water infiltration, and understand the aquifer response and, consequently, the effects on river baseflow. The TAG (Technopole Agen-Garonne) project aims to increase the economic wealth of the region while respecting the region's agricultural traditions. Runoff water from the TAG zone is collected in retention basins and is a potential source to recharge the shallow alluvial aquifer. Sampling campaigns were carried out during the summer of 2019 to collect groundwater samples from several observation wells. Groundwater levels were measured in 132 wells/boreholes to determine the groundwater level fluctuations and create piezometric maps. Piper, spatial distribution, and ionic ratio plots were used to determine the dominant hydrochemical processes and to delineate the hydrochemical facies in the study area. The groundwater chemistry is controlled by silicate weathering and anthropogenic influence. Groundwater quality appears to be affected by the river water in the wells located in the low plain area. The measurements showed that the groundwater levels in the wells located near the river increase more than 2 m after a flood event. The artificial recharge has increased the groundwater level by more than 1 m close to the infiltration basin after a rainstorm. Similarly, a three-dimensional (3D) groundwater model shows a similar magnitude aquifer response to the induced infiltration. The modeling-obtained result shows that the infiltrated water would take about 4 months to reach the Garonne River, which is an appropriate time to maintain the river's low-flow and thermal buffering capacity, and thus the functioning of its ecosystems during dry periods.

Determining the dynamics of river-lake runoff systems on multiple time scales and their differences in response to driving forces can provide insights into hydrological processes and water resource management. This study investigates the synergistic evolution of river-lake runoff systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYR) using the cross-wavelet transform method. The effects of different driving force changes on river-lake runoff regimes are quantified based on the Budyko hypothesis, and an InVEST model is developed to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of habitat quality. The results indicate that during the variation period, the runoff distributions of the Yangtze River-Dongting Lake and Yangtze River--Poyang Lake runoff systems are both skewed towards lower values in the flood seasons compared with those in the base period. The storage of lakes mitigates the extent of human disturbance to the mainstream hydrological regime, particularly under extremely low condi-tions. From 1960 to 2021, five significant resonance periods are indicated in the river-lake runoff system, and the phase-angle relationships indicate a positive phase coupling between the lake and mainstream hydrological regimes, with the lake lagging behind the mainstream; however, this interaction tends to weaken. In the mainstream and Dongting Lake basins, subsurface conditions are the dominant factor contributing to runoff variability, with contributions ranging from 50.9% to 72.6%; in the Poyang Lake basin, precipitation is the dominant factor, with a contribution of 50.6%; and in the Han River basin, changes in the potential evapo-transpiration contribute to 50.6% of runoff variability. The proportion of high habitat quality in the MLYR is approximately 52%, the Dongting and Poyang Lake basins indicate a high habitat quality rating. However, frequent human activity is the main reason of conversion from higher habitats to lower ones, which may result in wetland habitat degradation.

Both natural and artificial factors are climate change drivers, although the effect of natural factors are lesser than the anthropogenic drivers. These factors have changed the pattern of precipitation resulting in a rise in sea levels, changes in evapotranspiration, occurrence of flood overwintering of pathogens, increased resistance of pests and parasites, and reduced productivity of plants. Although excess CO2 promotes growth of C-3 plants, high temperatures reduce the yield of important agricultural crops due to high evapotranspiration. These two factors have an impact on soil salinization and agriculture production, leading to the issue of water and food security. Farmers have adopted different strategies to cope with agriculture production in saline and saline sodic soil. Recently the inoculation of halotolerant plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in saline fields is an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach to overcome salinity and promote crop growth and yield in saline and saline sodic soil. These halotolerant bacteria synthesize certain metabolites which help crops in adopting a saline condition and promote their growth without any negative effects. There is a complex interkingdom signaling between host and microbes for mutual interaction, which is also influenced by environmental factors. For mutual survival, nature induces a strong positive relationship between host and microbes in the rhizosphere. Commercialization of such PGPR in the form of biofertilizers, biostimulants, and biopower are needed to build climate resilience in agriculture. The production of phytohormones, particularly auxins, have been demonstrated by PGPR, even the pathogenic bacteria and fungi which also modulate the endogenous level of auxins in plants, subsequently enhancing plant resistance to various stresses. The present review focuses on plant-microbe communication and elaborates on their role in plant tolerance under changing climatic conditions.

Numerous studies have examined the changes in the hydrology of Nepal, which includes a significant upstream portion of the Himalayas. However, there is a lack of holistic studies on the spatial-temporal evolution of hydrologic dynamics over the entire nation and over long periods. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the changes in river discharge, flood occurrence, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) across all river basins in Nepal using hydrological-hydrodynamic simulations spanning for 40 years (1979-2018) at similar to 5 km spatial resolution, and downscaled flood attributes at similar to 90 m resolution. The spatio-temporal variations in river discharge and inundation extent are examined through mapping of decadal trends using a quantile analysis method. The results indicate that the dynamics of river discharge has evolved varyingly across different river basins. The evolution pattern within a basin generally agrees with that at the basin outlet, but notable exceptions are found, indicating high hydro-climatic heterogeneity within the basins. The decadal evaluation of flood dynamics over major flooded areas suggests that inundation dynamics is strongly influenced by various flow characteristics, including the timing, duration, and magnitude, and that the evolution of flood dynamics is more complex than that of river discharge. Results indicate that the TWS dynamics over entire Nepal is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage, and groundwater storage has been in continuous decline (-1.74 cm/year) in the recent decades (2002-2016). This study provides a basis to advance the understanding of long-term hydrologic changes in the Himalayan region with important implications for improved water resources management.

This paper illustrates the implementation of ARClim on two coastal sectors, operational downtime in fishing coves and flooding in coastal settlements, aiming to provide a tool to visualize comparative estimates of risk, which may enable decision makers and stakeholders to prioritize adaptation measures. The risk is calculated as a function of the hazard, exposure, and sensitivity. Exposure and sensitivity are characterized using present day information. To assess the hazard, wave climate for a historical period (1985-2004) and a projection (2026-2045) were modeled with six general circulation models (GCMs) for an RCP8.5 scenario. Similarly, sea-level rise was computed from 21 GCMs. Results show that the flooding hazard is mostly dependent on sea-level rise, with waves playing a minor role. However, the flooding risk is highly variable along the coast, due to differences in the exposure, which strongly depends on the population of each settlement.

A densely populated coastal urban area along a river estuary was selected for this work. We developed a three-dimensional (3D) shallow unconfined aquifer model of the site. We calibrated it with field measurements and used it to predict areas prone to groundwater flooding under different SLR scenarios. Results show that the water table is controlled by the river level as well as by aging infrastructure such as aging combined sewer and drinking water networks which drain and recharge the unconfined aquifer. Steadystate simulations run considering current river level scenarios show a very shallow aquifer throughout the area and simulations under different SLR scenarios predict that the water table starts to emerge from the ground in the low-lying parts of the site for 0.4 m of SLR. Overall, this work suggests that groundwater in coastal urban areas is regulated by anthropogenic and natural systems and is susceptible to climate change contributing to inundation together with marine flooding and intense precipitation.

In Norway, an ageing infrastructure with already insufficient drainage capacities results in large amounts of runoff during high-intensity rainfall events causing frequent floods in urban areas. Due to limited available space to handle the future projected increase in stormwater, there is a need to utilize already occupied space for stormwater management, such as roads and streets, during extreme events. Limited research has been done on the design and applicability of urban streets as temporarily flood ways diverting stormwater to the nearest recipient. This paper will study the benefits and limitations of adapting urban streets as safe flood ways to route stormwater by modelling an urban street as a floodway. Streets as floodways will require additional hydraulic performance criteria and safety criteria. Performance criteria are identified and evaluated, and a method is proposed for the evaluation of urban streets applicability as floodways. The method can be used to evaluate the applicability of multifunctional streets used as urban floodways and can be adapted by municipalities as a decision support tool for stormwater management.

Using data from the 'Bangladesh Disaster-Related Statistics-2015', we assessed disaster-related health outcomes namely, injury, disability, and death. We applied three logistic regression models to examine the relationships between individual socio-economic characteristics, reported disaster-related injury, disability, and death. Our study found that 145.9 disaster-related injuries, 14.4 disabilities, and 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population were reported in Bangladesh over 2009-2014. Floods were responsible for the highest percentage of injury, disability, and death followed by thunderstorms. The elderly and children were more likely to suffer from disaster-related injuries compared to adults. Disaster preparedness was a protective factor for both disasters related injury and disability. We observed geographic variation in the number of injuries, disability, and death across the districts in Bangladesh. Policy-makers can use the study findings to strengthen risk-monitoring, assessment, and preparedness strategies and actions for extreme weather events related to the rapidly changing climate.

In coastal communities accurate information on the exposure of infrastructure can make an important contribution to adaptation planning. In this study, we use high resolution elevation data from airborne LiDAR to generate storm flooding scenarios for three coastal communities (Utqiagvik, Wainwright, and Kaktovik) in northern Alaska. To estimate the potential for damage to infrastructure caused by flooding for each community, we generated data on replacement costs and used it to estimate the financial impact of 24 storm flooding scenarios of varying intensities. This analysis shows that all three communities are exposed to storm surges, but highlights the fact that infrastructure in Utqiagvik (the administrative center of the North Slope Borough) is significantly more exposed than buildings in Wainwright and Kaktovik. Our findings show that flooding scenarios can complement information gained from past events and help to inform local-decision making.

However, the impacts of future snow changes on the hydrological processes in the high mountains of the "Third Pole" are still largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to project future snow changes and their impacts on hydrology in the upstream region of the Salween River (USR) under two shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585) using a physically based cryosphere-hydrology model. We found that the climate would become warmer (0.2 degrees C per decade under SSP126 and 0.7 degrees C per decade under SSP585) and wetter (5mm per decade under SPP126 and 27.8mm per decade under SSP585) in the USR in the future under these two SSPs. In this context, the snowfall, snow cover, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt runoff are projected to exhibit significant decreasing trends during 1995-2100, and the decreases are projected to be most prominent in summer and autumn. The future (2021-2100) snowmelt runoff is projected to significantly increase in spring compared with the reference period (1995-2014), which would benefit the availability of water resources in the growing season. The annual total runoff would significantly increase in all of the future periods due to increased rainfall, which would increase the availability of water resources within the basin, but the high peak flow that occurs in summer may cause rain flooding with short duration and high intensity. Compared with the reference period (the contribution of snowmelt runoff to the total runoff was determined to be 17.5 %), the rain- and snow-dominated pattern of runoff would shift to a rain-dominated pattern after the near term (2021-2040) under SSP585, whereas it would remain largely unchanged under SSP126. Climate change would mainly change the pattern of the snowmelt runoff, but it would not change the annual hydrograph pattern (dominated by increased rainfall). These findings improve our understanding of the responses of cryosphere-hydrological processes under climate change, providing valuable information for integrated water resource management, natural disaster prevention, and ecological environmental protection at the Third Pole.

J	Wasko, C; Nathan, R; Stein, L; O'Shea, D				Wasko, Conrad; Nathan, Rory; Stein, Lina; O'Shea, Declan			Evidence of shorter more extreme rainfalls and increased flood variability under climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Flooding; Extreme rainfall; Soil moisture; Trend analysis; Climate change	SOIL-MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; ATTRIBUTION; MAGNITUDE; STREAMFLOW; FREQUENCY; SENSITIVITY; PATTERNS; RISK	Increases in extreme rainfall intensities as a result of climate change pose a great risk due to the possibility of increases in pluvial flooding, particularly in urban and developed areas. But evidence is emerging that the observed increases in extreme rainfall are not resulting in universal increases in flooding. Indeed, on a global scale, studies consistently find more gauge stations with decreasing rather than increasing trends in the annual maxima flood magnitude. Here, we aim to improve our understanding of how rainfall and streamflow extremes are changing and why floods are not always observed to increase despite increases in rainfall extremes. To do so, we examine trends in streamflow events using 2776 stations from the Global Runoff Data Centre, with events chosen to isolate the impact of changes to their respective rainfall and antecedent soil moisture. The analysis is limited to stations with 30 years or more of active record with the majority of stations in North America, Europe, Brazil, Oceania, and southern Africa. Consistent with physical reasoning, for more frequent events such as the annual maxima, it is found the peak 1-day rainfall event intensity is increasing approximately a rate of 6-7%/degrees C, with rarer event intensities increasing at a rate exceeding the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. We find that storm volumes are not increasing as greatly as the peak rainfall and storm durations are decreasing, pointing to an intensification of rainfall events and a peakier temporal pattern. While rainfall is intensifying, the magnitude of frequent floods (those expected to occur on average once per year) are in general decreasing, particularly in tropical and arid regions of the world. We find that this is likely due to a dominance of drying antecedent soil moisture conditions. However, the magnitude of rarer floods has, on average been increasing. We suggest this is because, for these rarer events, the increase in rainfall outweighs the decrease in soil moisture. Our results point to a worst of both world's scenario where small floods, responsible for filling our water supplies, are decreasing, while the large flood events which pose a risk to life and infrastructure, are increasing.

J	Pramanik, MK; Dash, P; Behal, D				Pramanik, Malay Kumar; Dash, Poli; Behal, Dimple			Improving outcomes for socioeconomic variables with coastal vulnerability index under significant sea-level rise: an approach from Mumbai coasts	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Mumbai coast; Geospatial approach; Coastal management; Coastal vulnerability; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EAST-COAST; IMPACTS; HAZARDS; INDIA	Climate change has led to increased sea levels, which are caused by a complex interplay of the physical environment components from coastal areas, causing the rise in storm surge, erosion and flooding. In this scenario, the low-lying topography of the Mumbai region is highly susceptible to sea level-induced flooding and coastal erosion due to the increasing number of economic activities. The unsustainable urbanization, unplanned development, and huge land conversion lead to the destruction of this region lead to the destruction of mangroves and filled waterways with construction debris which makes the region more vulnerable to flooding due to inadequate drainage, overflow and absence of natural protectors. These human-induced factors and their impacts remain unknown. Therefore, the study uses four socioeconomic variables (CVI4) with five geological (CVI5) and three geological variables (CVI8; with integrating CVI5) to assess the role of developmental and socio-economic activities in overall coastal vulnerability (CVI12) analysis. To quantify the importance of the combined variables and understand the response, random forest (RF) model was also used. This study selected four different iterations with integrating the pixel-based differentially weighted rank values of all variables to determine the significant causes behind that have an impact on coastal vulnerability index (CVI). The results show that CVI5 and CVI8 contributed 7.8% and 36.9%, respectively, whereas CVI4 contributed 55.3% to the CVI12. The response curve shows that the influence of these variables is an increasing trend to CVI12 and the results of CVI12 are highly correlated with socioeconomic index variables (r = 0.84, p = 0.001) which indicates the socio-economic variables played a major role towards the coastal vulnerability of the region. It suggests that unsustainable urbanization, unplanned development and coastal erosion increasing pressure make Mumbai and Kurla region more vulnerable to flood. Accordingly, CVI12 results show 55.83 km of the shoreline surveyed, being very low vulnerable, a moderate vulnerability of 60.91 km, while a high vulnerability of 50.75 km is considered to be very high. The results may be used as a guide in formulating policies to mitigate and adjust the Mumbai coast as the rise in sea level is expected to cause more frequent coastal floods, etc.	[Pramanik, Malay Kumar] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India; [Pramanik, Malay Kumar] Asian Inst Technol AIT, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Dash, Poli] Deshapran Coll Teachers Educ, Purba Medinipur 721427, W Bengal, India; [Behal, Dimple] Sch Planning & Architecture, Bhopal 462030, India	Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; Asian Institute of Technology; School of Planning & Architecture, Bhopal	Pramanik, MK (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi 110067, India.; Pramanik, MK (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol AIT, Sch Environm Resources & Dev, Dept Dev & Sustainabil, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand.	malaygeo@gmail.com; polidas89@gmail.com; dimplebehal9@gmail.com	Pramanik, Malay/AAU-1085-2021	Pramanik, Malay/0000-0002-7085-1236	University Grants Commission (New Delhi, India) Junior Research Fellowship	University Grants Commission (New Delhi, India) Junior Research Fellowship(University Grants Commission, India)	M.

However, the effects of these control works on water flow rates and sediment yields have been scarcely investigated under possible scenarios of climate and land-use changes. On this regard, the use of hydrological models, such as SWAT, provide reliable hydrological predictions under variable environmental conditions. To fill this gap, this study has evaluated the effectiveness of check dams on the hydrological response of a forest headwater in Calabria (Southern Italy) in comparison with an unregulated subcatchment with very similar environmental conditions. In this regard, the effects of different combined scenarios of climate change (through three GCMs and two RCPs applied to a time period of the next 80 years) and land use (forest, pasture, and cropland) on water flow rates and sediment yields in the two headwaters were analysed using the SWAT model. The SWAT model was first calibrated in a third headwater with very similar climatic, soil, and land-use conditions, and this verification showed a satisfactory prediction capacity of water flow rate. The water flow rate prediction capacity of the model was satisfactory (coefficients of determination and efficiency of Nash and Sutcliffe equal to 0.71 and 0.67, respectively, and percent bias of 14.9%). No significant differences were detected for the water flow rates and sediment yields between the two subcatchments (with or without check dams) among the different land-use and climate change scenarios. This was linked to the low hydrological response of both headwaters to the forcing actions, which influenced the low effectiveness of the control works. SWAT estimated higher values of both mean and maximum values of water flow rates and sediment yields under RCP2.6 compared with RCP8.5. Both water flow rates and sediment yields were predicted to be very low under all climate and land-use scenarios. The regulated headwater with check dams was predicted to always produce more runoff and erosion compared with the subcatchment without check dams. The increases were predicted to be up to 60% for the maximum flow rate and 30-35% for the sediment yield in forest land use under RCP2.6. Although there was a limitation in this study due to the lack of validation of the erosion data (due to unavailable records of sediment yield), this study demonstrated how the use of check dams in headwater catchments may be not effective for soil conservation purposes several decades after their installation in Mediterranean semiarid areas, where the water flow and erosion rate are limited.

J	Haq, SMA				Haq, Shah Md Atiqul			The impact of extreme weather events on fertility preference and gender preference in Bangladesh	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Bangladesh; extreme weather events; fertility preference; gender preference; intended fertility timing; perceived risk of dying	FAMILY-SIZE PREFERENCES; SOCIAL NETWORKS; WOMEN; POPULATION; MORTALITY; LIVELIHOODS; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS; DECISION	The link between population dynamics and climate-related severe events is complicated. Extreme weather events (EWEs), along with other factors such as socioeconomic and cultural factors, influence population dynamics, particularly changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. This study focuses solely on the fertility aspect of climate change and aims to investigate it in Bangladesh, which is extremely sensitive to climate change and EWEs such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. On a regular basis, the country is confronted with a number of EWEs. The current study examines how different types of extreme weather events affect vulnerable people's decisions to have children or to prefer children of a certain gender. People who reside in a particular area may be more vulnerable to particular EWE types, which may result in different preferences for fertility and gender. This study employed individual-level data from three places (flood-prone, drought-prone, and cyclone-prone), each exposed to a distinct hazard, to address this issue, and collected pertinent information from 177 respondents in the susceptible areas using a survey questionnaire. The quantitative results show that the gender of the first child, the perceived risk of infant death due to EWE, the opinion on having more children to recover from the damage and losses caused by EWE, government and non-governmental organization (NGO) support during EWE, and the intended timing of child bearing (after or before EWE) are all significant factors influencing fertility preferences and gender preferences. The findings also indicate that the three regions under investigation have statistically distinct preferences for fertility and gender. There were larger differences between flood-prone areas and drought- and cyclone-prone areas. The complex issue of variations due to different EWEs requires more in-depth studies with larger samples and different methodological techniques.

An Approach for Prioritizing Natural Infrastructure Practices to Mitigate Flood and Nitrate Risks in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin	LAND			English	Article						natural infrastructure; flooding; nitrate-nitrogen; Mississippi-Atchafalaya river basin; GIS analysis	GULF-OF-MEXICO; LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION PRACTICES; SPATIAL OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NUTRIENT REDUCTION; REDUCING NITROGEN	Risks from flooding and poor water quality are evident at a range of spatial scales and climate change will exacerbate these risks in the future. Natural infrastructure (NI), consisting of structural or perennial vegetation, measures that provide multiple ecosystem benefits have the potential to reduce flood and water quality risks. In this study, we intersected watershed-scale risks to flooding and nitrate export in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB) of the central U.S. with potential locations of seven NI practices (row crop conversion, water, and sediment control basins, depressional wetlands, nitrate-removal wetlands, riparian buffers, and floodplain levees and row crop change) to prioritize where NI can be most effective for combined risk reduction at watershed scales. Spatial data from a variety of publicly-available databases were analyzed at a 10 m grid cell to locate NI practices using a geographic information system (GIS). NI practices were presented at the regional basin scale and local Iowa-Cedar watershed in eastern Iowa to show individual practice locations. A prioritization scheme was developed to show the optimal watersheds for deploying NI practices to minimize flooding and water quality risks in the MARB. Among the 84 HUC4 basins in the MARB, 28 are located in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio Rivers basins. The Wabash and Iowa-Cedar basins (HUCs 0512 and 0708, respectively) within these basins were found to rank among the uppermost quintile for nearly all practices evaluated, indicating widespread opportunities for NI implementation. Study results are a launching point from which to improve the connections between watershed scale risks and the potential use of NI practices to reduce these risks.

Mapping the spatial distribution of coastal flood susceptibility is a prerequisite for coastal flood risk analysis, and an important step in risk prevention and management. Based on the actual coastal flood propagation process, this study uses a 2D-sour-ce-pathway-receptor (2D-SPR) model to construct a complex network for coastal flood susceptibility analysis. In addition, it uses the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) multi-attribute decision-making method to calculate the importance of each unit in the system, namely centrality Mi which ranges from 0.0716 to 4.3524, with a higher value indicating a higher importance. Finally, the spatial distribution of coastal flood susceptibility is drawn with ArcGIS software. For a clearer display, we divide the data into 12 levels according to the natural breakpoint method, and it can be seen that coastal flood susceptibility of different regions varies greatly. The classification results have obvious regularity, overall, open-land areas or parks, waters and southeast side have relatively higher values, which belong to the higher susceptibility area among the 12 levels. From the perspective of the integrity of the geographical unit, 15 locations including unbuilt areas and water areas are identified to have high flood susceptibilities relative to the mean values of all the areas. This study fully considers the hazard formation process of coastal floods, especially the complex interaction between hazard sources and receptors. These findings provide a new perspective for the rapid, objective assessment of coastal flood susceptibility.

A primary household survey has been done to collect data on socio demographic profile, livelihood strategy, health, food, water, social network, natural disaster and river bank erosion indicators which were selected for Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) analyses to predict and compare the vulnerability of mouzas currently suffering from frequent flooding, river bank erosion and embankment breaching on an annual basis. Secondary data are collected from the Human Development Report of Malda district; Regional Agriculture office and analyzed through relevant charts, diagrams and calculating index values. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of affected mouzas due to river bank erosion. The results indicate that the study area has experienced rise in water level, higher amount of water discharge, riverbank line change, constant land loss, embankment breaching and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability, particularly of poorer riverine people. From the result of both LVI and LVI- IPCC, high to moderate vulnerability condition has existed within the selected mouzas. The high vulnerable mouzas are Dharampur, Manikchak, Kesarpur, Mirpur, Mathurapur, Jot Bhabani and relatively less vulnerable mouzas are Suksena, Duani Tafir and Paschim Narayanpur in respect to both indices. The poor conditions of LVI components of the selected mouzas in the study area make them more expose and sensitive and decrease their adaptive capacity. These findings enable policymakers to formulate and implement effective strategies and programs to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience by improving the livelihoods of the vulnerable riverine community of all other parts in India as well as world.

Development of an Apparent Recharge Coefficient (ARC) for Estimating Groundwater Storage Changes due to Precipitation Events Using Time Series Monitoring Data	WATER			English	Article						groundwater recharge; cumulative precipitation; time-series monitoring; water resources management	WATER-TABLE FLUCTUATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YIELD; MOUNTAIN; BALANCE	Significant variation in the precipitation events caused by global climate change has made it difficult to manage water resources due to the increased frequency of unexpected droughts and floods. Under these conditions, groundwater is needed to ensure a sustainable water supply; thus, estimates of precipitation recharge are essential. In this study, we derived an apparent recharge coefficient (ARC) from a modified water table fluctuation equation to predict groundwater storage changes due to precipitation events. The ARC is calculated as the ratio of the recharge rate over the specific yield (R/S-y); therefore, it implicitly expresses variation inS(y). The ARC varies spatially and temporally, corresponding to the precipitation events and hydrogeological characteristics of unsaturated materials. ARCs for five monitoring wells from two basins in Korea in different seasons were calculated using a 10-year groundwater level and weather dataset for 2005-2014. Then, the reliability of the ARCs was tested by the comparison of the predicted groundwater level changes for 2015 and 2016 with observed data. The root mean square error ranged from 0.03 to 0.09 m, indicating that the predictions were acceptable, except for one well, which had thick clay layers atop the soil layer; the low permeability of the clay slowed the precipitation recharge, interfering with groundwater level responses. We performed a back-calculation ofRfrom theS(y)values of the study areas; the results were similar to those obtained via other methods, confirming the practical applicability of the ARC. In conclusion, the ARC is a viable method for predicting groundwater storage changes for regions where long-term monitoring data are available, and subsequently will facilitate advanced decision making for allocating and developing water resources for residents, industry, and groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

Climate-change-driven sea-level rise, coral reef degradation, and changes in storm wave climate will lead to greater occurrence and impacts of wave-driven flooding. This poses a significant threat to their coastal communities. While greatly at risk, the complex hydrodynamics and bathymetry of reef-lined coasts make flood risk assessment and prediction costly and difficult. Here we use a large (>30,000) dataset of measured coral reef topobathymetric cross-shore profiles, statistics, machine learning, and numerical modeling to develop a set of representative cluster profiles (RCPs) that can be used to accurately represent the shoreline hydrodynamics of a large variety of coral reef-lined coasts around the globe. In two stages, the large dataset is reduced by clustering cross-shore profiles based on morphology and hydrodynamic response to typical wind and swell wave conditions. By representing a large variety of coral reef morphologies with a reduced number of RCPs, a computationally feasible number of numerical model simulations can be done to obtain wave runup estimates, including setup at the shoreline and swash separated into infragravity and sea-swell components, of the entire dataset. The predictive capability of the RCPs is tested against 5,000 profiles from the dataset. The wave runup is predicted with a mean error of 9.7-13.1%, depending on the number of cluster profiles used, ranging from 312 to 50. The RCPs identified here can be combined with probabilistic tools that can provide an enhanced prediction given a multivariate wave and water level climate and reef ecology state. Such a tool can be used for climate change impact assessments and studying the effectiveness of reef restoration projects, as well as for the provision of coastal flood predictions in a simplified (global) early warning system.

This study evaluated latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and runoff in four climate regions (temperate, continental, arid, and tropical) in East Asia from 2001 to 2015. Two community land model (CLM) experiments were performed using default LULC data (CLM 4.0) and newly created Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based LULC data from 2010 (CLM 2010) to assess the impact of LULC changes on climate. Anthropogenic LULC changes have considerable impacts on the climate and its extremes. For the whole East Asia region, area-averaged runoff decreased by 2.10%. The temperate region experienced a 3.16% decrease in runoff and a 422% increase in LE due to an increase in irrigation activities that could lead to the drying of soil moisture and drought in the future. In contrast, the arid region experienced a 630% increase in runoff despite dry conditions and a 5.70% reduction in LE, which ultimately increased H by 2.25% and caused an intensification of the climate in the form of strong heat waves and floods. The continental region followed the same trend as the temperate region with a noticeable decrease in winter H, which caused severe cold weather. The tropical region showed a slight impact of LULC change on energy fluxes due to high precipitation and intense solar radiations. Overall, the results of this research follow the 'dry gets drier and wet gets wetter' paradigm due to LULC changes in the study region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	van den Brandeler, F; Gupta, J; Hordijk, M				van den Brandeler, Francine; Gupta, Joyeeta; Hordijk, Michaela			Megacities and rivers: Scalar mismatches between urban water management and river basin management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban water governance; Metropolitan areas; River basin management; Scalar mismatch	RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; MEXICO; TRANSITIONS; SYSTEM; IMPACT; REUSE	Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates.

Developing predictive models for flood-induced financial losses is crucial for applications such as insurance underwriting. This research uses the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) dataset between 2000 and 2020 to evaluate the predictive skill of past data in predicting near-future flood loss risk. Our approach applies neural networks (Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks), decision trees (Extreme Gradient Boosting), and kernel-based regressors (Gaussian Processes) to estimate pointwise losses. It aggregates them over intervals using a biascorrected Burr-Pareto distribution to predict risk. The regression models help identify the most informative predictors and highlight crucial factors influencing flood-related financial losses. Applying our approach to quantify the county-level coastal flood loss risk in eight US Southern states results in an R-2 = 0.807, substantially outperforming related work using stage-damage curves. More detailed testing on 11 counties with significant claims in the NFIP dataset reveals that Extreme Gradient Boosting yields the most favorable results, and bias correction significantly improves the similarity between the predicted and reference claim amount distributions. Our experiments also show that, despite the already experienced climate change, the difference in future short-term risk predictions of flood-loss amounts between historical shifting or expanding training data windows is insignificant.

Increasing trends in the frequency and intensity of floods and landslides have been projected by climate models. This necessitates the development of more effective measures such as nature-based solutions (NBS) which can complement grey infrastructures. Recent studies have identified knowledge gaps and limitations in existing research and tools that aid in spatial planning for the implementation of large-scale NBS and proposed new methodologies for the spatial allocation of large-scale NBS for flood risk reduction. This work presents a novel method for mapping the suitability of NBS addressing geo-hydrological hazards such as shallow landslides, debris flow, and rockfall, which are typically caused due to slope instability. This methodology incorporates landslide susceptibility mapping, and was used to create a toolbox ESRI ArcGIS environment to aid decision-makers in the planning and implementation of large-scale NBS. The spatial allocation toolbox was applied to the case study Portofino promontory, Liguria region, Italy, and 70% of the area was found to be highly susceptible to landslides. The produced suitability maps show that 41%, 33%, and 65% of the study area is suitable for the restoration of terraces, bio-engineering, and vegetative measures such as NBS for landslide risk reduction.

Understanding the social perceptions of risk and hazard-related concerns can help in the development of adaptive capacity and associated management strategy preferences. This study employed structured questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the households of the Anlo Beach fishing community in the Western region of Ghana perceived and responded to coastal hazards. The respondents ranked coastal erosion and salinization first and second, ahead of seawater flooding and other hazards in terms of important risks in the study area. Responses illustrated high levels of knowledge and awareness about coastal hazards but low levels of trust in government and commitments in terms of taking personal mitigation measures. To varying degrees, respondent characteristics such as length of residency and occupancy status are positively and significantly associated with coastal hazard perception whereas the level of education was negative. Generally, the findings illustrated the need for better education and awareness campaigns about self-mitigation actions such as discontinuing beach sand utilization and exploiting mangroves as firewood, and embracing the restoration of mangrove ecosystems. More importantly, the government should reconsider her earlier shelved plan of relocating the entire community to a safer location.

An unprecedented ongoing megadrought is severely affecting its ecological functioning, flood pulse dynamics, and fire regime. Regarding this problematic, the present study generates reliable information about the following key issues: 1-Evolution and dynamics, 2-Origin and determinants, and 3-Forecast based on identified determinants and current trends. Results show that the evolution of the megadrought has been differentiable in both, space and time. As for its origin and determinants, Climate Change was ratified as one of the most important threats to the Pantanal, and to vast areas of South America, since a strong correlation was identified between megadrought's dynamics and the occurrence of intense marine heatwaves at Northern Hemisphere oceanic waters, and more specifically, at the Northeast Pacific. Results also show that the megadrought is expected to continue at both the Pantanal and the surrounding Highlands, at least until December 2023. Thus, an intensification of fires risk, extending now to areas historically flooded or perhumid should be expected, concomitantly to a very negative impact on non-fire-resistant vegetation cover, as well as ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, perhaps even worse than those from 2020, widely covered by the international media.

J	Dendir, Z; Simane, B				Dendir, Zelalem; Simane, Belay			Farmers' perceptions about changes in climate variables: Perceived risks and household responses in different agro-ecological communities, Southern Ethiopia	CLIMATE SERVICES			English	Article						Perception; Adaptation; Agro-ecologies; Gurage; Ethiopia	AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; POLICY; KENYA; VULNERABILITY; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	Rain-fed dependent farmers in Ethiopia are highly affected by changing climate situations. Thus, this study examines farmers' perception of climatic change, related risks, and adaptation practices that farmers have adopted to address the adverse pressures on livelihoods and resources in different agro-ecological communities of Gurage zone, Southern Ethiopia. A research approach involving both quantitative and qualitative methods was used. 357 household surveys were conducted with representative households. Statistical differences in selecting adaptation strategies between the agro-ecological communities were measured by employing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A Post-Hoc analysis was also performed to identify the location of the variance. The study revealed, the majority of the respondents interviewed in different agro-ecological communities had perceived declining precipitation and increased temperature. Similarly, respondents reported that the frequency of extreme events like drought, flood, frost, and storm had increased. A significant difference was found between agro-ecological communities in farm management practices. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that farm management practices were mostly practiced by the lowland and highland (p < 0.005) agro-ecological communities. Therefore, since climate stress coupled with socio-economic and institutional stress has serious implications for farmer's livelihood sources, a holistic climate change adaptation strategy considering agro-ecological variation is required to sustain farm household livelihood.

J	Zhao, DS; Deng, SQ; Zhang, JC				Zhao, Dongsheng; Deng, Siqi; Zhang, Jiacheng			Spatiotemporal characteristics of dry-wet abrupt alternation events in China during 1960-2018	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						China; climate change; compound events; drought and flood; dry-wet abrupt alternation	HUAIHE RIVER-BASIN; SNOW COVER; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; FLOODS; TREND	The dry-wet abrupt alternation (DWAA) can lead to consecutive drought-flood hazards with high socioeconomic losses. Over the past decades, China has suffered huge economic losses of more than $15 billion due to drought and flood hazards. With the rapid socio-economic development, the damages caused by DWAA are expected to be more serious. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of DWAA were poorly known at the continental scale. In this study, DWAA was identified by the short-cycle dry-wet abrupt alternation index (SDWAI) across eight eco-regions of China from 1960 to 2018. Results showed that DWAA mainly occurred in humid/semihumid region (III), subtropical humid region (V), and tropical humid region (VI). Seasonally, DWAA is mostly concentrated in summer, with the highest frequency in June and July. Meanwhile, 67% of the total DWAA events were observed in nonsummer seasons. From 1960 to 2018, the intensity of dry to wet (DTW) events has increased by 0.015/10 year. The north and west of China (except region III, V, VI, and VII) experienced an increasing trend in DTW intensity, but a decreasing trend in WTD intensity. DWAA events in some parts of China were frequently observed, which was related to the variability in precipitation patterns caused by climate change. The identification of local hotspots and seasonal distribution of DWAA will support decision-making for warning and mitigating the drought and flood hazards.

All potential threats were integrated into a cumulative threat index to illustrate which areas of the United States will likely face the greatest overall threat to their urban forests. Urban forests with the greatest cumulative threat per unit area are in the eastern United States, particularly in some coastal counties. Urban forests that have the greatest cumulative threat proportional to the percent of the county that is urbanized are in the highly urbanized areas along the DC-Boston corridor and in other metro areas (e.g., Atlanta, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; Houston, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina). By understanding local urban forest threats, management plans and policies can be enacted to help mitigate the impacts of and adapt to future threats to sustain healthy urban forests and associated benefits. Study Implications: By understanding the magnitude and variation in potential urban forest threats, forest managers can be better prepared to potentially minimize and adapt to future urban forest damage. Threat type and intensities of threats vary by location. Understanding the distribution and intensity of urban forest threats can be used to help direct policies and forest management plans to sustain long-term urban forest health. A tool to assess urban forest threats by county is available in the supplemental materials.

Local authorities and managers use them in elaborating rescue and urbanism plans, which do not always work, highlighting society's vulnerability in the particular context of global environmental and climate changes. Within this context, the United Nations (Sendai, 2015) advised to construct a series of indicators to better cope with human losses and economic disasters. Actually, the question is whether or not such indicators do constitute successful decision-making tools. In this article, we critically reviewed the recent literature (from 2013 to 2017) using the Web of Science database of Clarivate Analytics to assess how indicators are currently being constructed in risk management, with a focus on risks of inundations, coastal and seismic risks. This task allowed us to discuss the spatial and temporal scale at which indicators of risk management can be applicable, to what extent they should be physically oriented and if they can fit the needs of governance framework. Based on our findings, we suggest further work on a new series of less descriptive, more dynamic and more user-friendly indicators. Finally, we encourage the dire need for continuous work to overcome the misinterpretation of used indicators and how to reduce the communication gap between the scientific community, decision makers, managers and the population.

In the study, statistical trends in seasonal and annual mean, maximum, extreme and low discharge values were investigated using the Mann Kendall test. The results show a temporal and spatial variability of trends in discharge. In general, a decreasing trend in water quantities in the rivers was observed. However, results at some gauging stations indicate statistically significant increasing trends, especially for maximum and extreme discharges. Additional analyses show that the discharge trends depend on the location of the gauging station.

Flooding regime variability is a key driver of ecological dynamism in these systems, dictating primary productivity on a large spatial scale. The functional composition or diversity of wetland-dependent bird species has been found to be sensitive to fluctuations in hydrological regimes and can thus be indicative of cascading ecosystem responses associated with climate change. In this paper, we investigate whether large-scale changes in inundation and fire-a significant additional biodiversity determinant in (semi-)arid landscapes-are reliable predictors of functional group responses of wetland-dependent birds along a perennial channel of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We fit generalized additive models (GAMs) to 6 years of bird survey data collected along similar to 190-km-long annual transects and use remotely sensed landscape-level inundation estimates, as well as spatiotemporal distance to fire, to predict the responsiveness of seven trait-based functional group abundances. During the surveys, a total of 89 different wetland-dependent bird species were recorded, including 76 residents, across all years, with below-surface feeding waders consistently the most abundant functional group. Including estimated spatiotemporal variability in flooding and fire, as well as their interactions, improved model fit for all seven functional groups, explaining between 46.8% and 68.3% of variability in functional group abundances. Covariates representing longer-term variability in inundation generally performed better than shorter-term ones. For example, variability in inundation over the 5 months preceding a survey best predicted the responses of all functional groups, which also all exhibited responsiveness to the interaction between flooding and fire. We were able to interpret the responses of individual functional groups, based on the resource exploitation assumption. Overall, our results suggest that perennial waters in dryland wetlands offer functional refugia to wetland-dependent birds and highlight the indicative power of large-scale trait-based bird monitoring. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of such a monitoring regime for dryland wetland ecosystems vulnerable to industrial-scale anthropogenic pressure and associated climate change.

Projections of Snow Water Equivalent Using a Process-Based Energy Balance Snow Model in Southwestern British Columbia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Complex terrain; Snowpack; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE-INDEX; RIVER-BASIN; IMPACTS; PRECIPITATION; CMIP5	Information about snow water equivalent in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, is used for flood management, agriculture, fisheries, and water resource planning. This study evaluates whether a process-based, energy balance snow model supplied with high-resolution statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation data can effectively simulate snow water equivalent (SWE) in the mountainous terrain of this region. Daily values of SWE from 1951 to 2018 are simulated at 1-km resolution and evaluated using a reanalysis SWE product [Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS)], manual snow-survey measurements at 41 sites, and automated snow pillows at six locations in the study region. Simulated SWE matches observed interannual variability well (R-2 > 0.8 for annual maximum SWE), but peak SWE biases of 20%-40% occur at some sites in the study domain, and higher biases occur where observed SWE is very low. Modeled SWE displays lower bias relative to SNODAS reanalysis at most manual survey locations. Future projections for the study area are produced using 12 downscaled climate model simulations and are used to illustrate the impacts of climate change on SWE at 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees C of warming. Model results are used to quantify spring SWE changes at different elevations of the Whistler mountain ski resort and the sensitivity of annual peak SWE in the Metropolitan Vancouver municipal watersheds to moderate temperature increases. The results both illustrate the potential utility of a process-based snow model and identify areas where the input meteorological variables could be improved. Significance StatementUsing high-resolution (1 km) climate data, we evaluate and apply a snow model in the mountainous terrain of coastal, southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Modeling snow water equivalent at high-resolution enables better representation of snow conditions that can vary widely over short distances and elevations. At 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees C of warming, future snow water equivalent levels at sites nearer the coast are more vulnerable to temperature increases than sites slightly higher in elevation and farther inland. Future efforts to improve the climate data may yield better agreement between simulated and observed snow levels in certain locations.

Household Sorting as Adaptation to Hurricane Risk in the United States	LAND ECONOMICS			English	Article							ESTIMATING EQUILIBRIUM-MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; MIGRATION RESPONSE; NATURAL DISASTERS; WEATHER; DAMAGES; PREPAREDNESS; PROJECTIONS; EXPERIENCE	We employ a structural model of location choice to estimate household sorting across the United States in response to hurricane risk. Using spatially detailed projections of future hurricane energy, we simulate regional population shifts and welfare effects of hurricane risk???induced migration in 2100. We find heterogeneous responses to hurricane risk for households that vary by number of children, age, educational attainment, and prior exposure to hurricane risk. Under future hurricane risk, although changes are small, we find declines in regional population shares along the hurricane-prone coasts and negative overall welfare effect. However, ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of hurricanes underestimates these effects.

Flood Risk Belief Heterogeneity and Coastal Home Price Dynamics	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONTINGENT VALUATION; MARKET; EXPERIENCES; RESPONSES; DISASTER; BEHAVIOR; NUMBER; MODEL	How do climate risk beliefs affect coastal housing markets? This paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence. First, we build a dynamic housing market model and show that belief heterogeneity can reconcile prior mixed evidence on flood risk capitalization. Second, we implement a door-to-door survey in Rhode Island, finding significant flood risk underestimation and sorting based on risk perceptions and amenity values. Third, we estimate that coastal prices exceed fundamentals by 6%-13% in our benchmark area, with potentially higher overvaluation in other locations. Finally, we quantify both allocative inefficiency and distributional consequences arising from flood risk misperceptions and insurance policy reform.

Predicting and mapping pluvial flood-prone areas is becoming a crucial step in flood mitigation and early warnings, as well as climate change adaptation strategies, to be incorporate in urban planning. Most commonly applied machine learning (ML) procedures for pluvial flood risk assessment, neglect to account for spatio-temporal constraints, leading to overoptimistic models that underestimate the prediction error. In this paper, we propose a novel ML -based methodology for pluvial flood risk prediction in the Metropolitan City of Venice which, introducing a features selection process and spatio-temporal cross-validation, permits to reduce overfitting of the resulting ML models. Spatio-temporal characteristics of floods are derived from a dataset of 60 historical events occurred in the area between 1995 and 2020. Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF) models are applied to identify and prioritize sub-areas that are more likely to be affected by pluvial flood risk, considering the daily precipitation amount and 12 different triggering factors. The models were validated using Random Cross-Validation (R-CV) and Leave Location and Time Out cross-validation (LLTO-CV), that split data in training and validation set considering both time and space. In addition, a forward features selection procedure was applied to identify the features, among the triggering factors, that better face spatio-temporal overfitting in pluvial flood prediction based on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score. Results suggest that Logistic Regression and LLTO-CV represent the most reliable model to predict pluvial flood events in new spatio-temporal conditions, while, among the triggering factors, distance to river and distance to road resulted the prominent ones.

This has been led in a concerted international effort by the INTENSE Crosscutting Project of the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Exchanges) Hydroclimatology Panel. Here, we summarize the main findings so far and suggest future directions for research, including: the benefits of convection-permitting climate modelling; towards understanding mechanisms of change; the usefulness of temperature-scaling relations; towards detecting and attributing extreme rainfall change; and the need for international coordination and collaboration. Evidence suggests that the intensity of long-duration (1 day+) heavy precipitation increases with climate warming close to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) rate (6-7% K-1), although large-scale circulation changes affect this response regionally. However, rare events can scale at higher rates, and localized heavy short-duration (hourly and sub-hourly) intensities can respond more strongly (e.g. 2 x CC instead of CC). Day-to-day scaling of short-duration intensities supports a higher scaling, with mechanisms proposed for this related to local-scale dynamics of convective storms, but its relevance to climate change is not clear. Uncertainty in changes to precipitation extremes remains and is influenced by many factors, including large-scale circulation, convective storm dynamics andstratification. Despite this, recent research has increased confidence in both the detectability and understanding of changes in various aspects of intense short-duration rainfall. To make further progress, the international coordination of datasets, model experiments and evaluations will be required, with consistent and standardized comparison methods and metrics, and recommendations are made for these frameworks. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.

Thus, the correct use of the tools (probability distributions and methods of estimating their parameters) necessary to carry out such analyzes is required to avoid possible negative consequences. This article presents four probability distributions from the generalized Beta families, using the L- and LH-moments method as parameter estimation. New elements are presented regarding the applicability of Dagum, Paralogistic, Inverse Paralogistic and the four-parameter Burr distributions in the flood frequency analysis. The article represents the continuation of the research carried out in the Faculty of Hydrotechnics, being part of larger and more complex research with the aim of developing a normative regarding flood frequency analysis using these methods. According to the results obtained, among the four analyzed distributions, the Burr distribution was found to be the best fit model because the theoretical values of the statistical indicators calibrated the corresponding values of the observed data. Considering the existence of more rigorous selection criteria, it is recommended to use these methods in the frequency analysis.

Yet it has also proved politically expedient to invoke climate change as an exogenous force that supposedly places disasters beyond the influence of local and national authorities(4,5). However, locally determined patterns of urbanization and spatial development are key factors to the exposure and vulnerability of people to climatic shocks(6). Using high-resolution annual data, this study shows that, since 1985, human settlements around the world-from villages to megacities-have expanded continuously and rapidly into present-day flood zones. In many regions, growth in the most hazardous flood zones is outpacing growth in non-exposed zones by a large margin, particularly in East Asia, where high-hazard settlements have expanded 60% faster than flood-safe settlements. These results provide systematic evidence of a divergence in the exposure of countries to flood hazards. Instead of adapting their exposure, many countries continue to actively amplify their exposure to increasingly frequent climatic shocks. Analysis of high-resolution annual data shows that global human settlements have expanded continuously and rapidly into flood zones, with those in the most hazardous zones increasing by 122% from 1985 to 2015.

The objective of this study is to present different proposals for teach the risk of flooding using the GIS viewers offered by the NFZMS (National Flood Zone Mapping System) and the PATRICOVA (Spain). The idea is that, based on the selection of the same area of study (the mouth of the Jucar River-Valencia-and the mouth of the Segura River-Alicante), students determine the similarities and differences, for educational purposes, of these two geographical viewers. These proposals are aimed at the 2nd year of the Baccalaureate (17-18 years; optional subject of Geography). The objective is to enhance the skills of the students for understand the territory, especially their immediate environment, in the learning process. Furthermore, it also seeks to expand the knowledge of students with regard to these extreme phenomena experienced by society. This proposal shows that these types of tools are important for students to understand the social and territorial part of flooding events (vulnerability and exposure), which is the most salient part in terms of finding solutions to minimise their effects.

Within the Himalayan region, precipitation extremes are a rising concern, but their current understanding is limited. In this study, we use 113 years of precipitation data to rank and characterize precipitation extremes in the Indian Western Himalayas (IWH). Our statistical ranking method integrates precipitation spatial extent and its intensity across different durations for determining the severity of extreme events. The proposed ranking method accounts for multi-day duration ranking method to capture persistent precipitation episodes. Results show that the method accurately detects and ranks the most extreme precipitation events that occurred in the IWH and indicate locations of these events. Our results highlight that critical long duration events in the region (e.g., 10 days) are missed at ranks at shorter duration (e.g., 2-3 days), thereby highlighting the importance to multi-day precipitation extremes ranking. In addition, the proposed ranking method provides information about the event duration that will be associated with the highest impact on society, carrying high significance. Our findings are valuable for flood risk management and disaster risk reduction.

A study of UK peak flow data and sensitivity to observation period	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							NONSTATIONARY; NETWORK; FLOODS; RISK	Classical statistical methods for flood frequency estimation assume stationarity in the gauged data. However, recent focus on climate change and, within UK hydrology, severe floods in 2009 and 2015 has raised the profile of statistical analyses that include trends. This paper considers how parameter estimates for the generalised logistic distribution vary through time in the UK. The UK Benchmark Network (UKBN2) is used to allow focus on climate change separate from the effects of land-use change. We focus on the sensitivity of parameter estimates to adding data, through fixed-width moving window and fixed-start extending window approaches, and on whether parameter trends are more prominent in specific geographical regions. Under stationary assumptions, the addition of new data tends to further the convergence of parameters to some final value. However, addition of a single data point can vastly change non-stationary parameter estimates. Little spatial correlation is seen in the magnitude of trends in peak flow data, potentially due to the spatial clustering of catchments in the UKBN2. In many places, the ratio between the 50-year and 100-year flood is decreasing, whereas the ratio between the 2-year and 30-year flood is increasing, presenting as a flattening of the flood frequency curve.

Projections from a total of 9 Global Climate Models (GCMs) were utilized. Integrated MIKE 11 NAM-HD, a conceptual hydrological model was employed to simulate the streamflow at Hirakud and Mundali gauging sites of upper Mahanadi River basin (UMRB) and middle Mahanadi River basin (MMRB), respectively. Prior to generating the streamflow regimes for the projected scenarios, GCM simulated precipitation and temperature were bias corrected using India Meteorological Department (IMD) observed gridded precipitation and temperature datasets. Precipitation was corrected using quantile mapping technique employing four different approaches, i.e., seasonal, hybrid, monthly non-hybrid, and monthly hybrid approaches. Hybrid approaches explicitly correct the extreme rainfall using Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution whereas Gamma distribution is used for normal rainfall. Temperature data was corrected using Gaussian distribution on daily basis employing monthwise time series. L-moments based frequency analysis method was used to estimate the 50-year return period rainfall for observed and bias corrected projected time series to assess the efficacy of bias correction methods in correcting the extreme events. Monthly hybrid approach was found to resolve rainfall climatology over both UMRB and MMRB with improved skill in extreme rainfall correction. Though, monthly non-hybrid approach produced the seasonal cycle of rainfall with highest accuracy, it performed poorly in correcting the extremes. Under projected climate scenarios mean annual rainfall is found to be increasing for BCC-CSM1.1(m), HadGEM2-AO, GFDL-CM3, and IPSL-CM5A-LR whereas other GCMs show mixed signal compared to their mean state of historic period (1976-2005). Streamflow regime in projected climate was analyzed using ensemble mean of simulated streamflow from identified GCMs. Mean monthly streamflow were overall found to be increasing towards the end of the century i.e., in far-future defined as 2070-2099. Daily high flows (defined at 5% and 10% exceedance probability) were found to be increasing in their magnitude and frequency in far-future whereas occurrences of low flows (defined at 90% and 95% exceedance probability) were found to be predominantly decreasing under projected climate.

J	Turner, RE				Turner, R. Eugene			Variability in the discharge of the Mississippi River and tributaries from 1817 to 2020	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; UNITED-STATES; STREAMFLOW TRENDS; WATER; LAND; SEDIMENT; PATTERNS; DRAINAGE; BASEFLOW; CLIMATE	There are conflicting predictions of climate change effects and landuse on the discharge of the Mississippi River-the largest river in North America. Are discharges becoming higher or lower, and if they did change, then when? To address these uncertainties I compiled a two-hundred-year long dataset of the annual average, minimum, and maximum discharges at five stations draining the Mississippi River watershed: at Clinton, IA, Herman, MO, St. Louis, MO, Louisville, KY, and Vicksburg, MS. A spline/Lowess analysis tested for trends and inflection points. All three discharge metrics increased, and the minimum annual discharge increased faster than either the annual maximum discharge or annual average discharge. A regression analysis of variations in average discharges from 1950 to 2020 at these five locations demonstrates correlations to the air pressure differentials represented in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index for January, February and March. The longest data set, for the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, demonstrates a similar direct relationship with the NAO Index from 1826 to 1969. After 1969, however, the relationship between discharge and the NAO Index is insignificant even though the range of Index values overlap for the two intervals. A breakpoint and rise in discharge ca. 1970 is consistent with well-documented land cover and land use changes occurring then that resulted in reduced evapotranspiration as homogenous cropping systems were established, and a higher percent of precipitation was routed into groundwater and baseflow. The Bonnet Carre Spillway at New Orleans, LA, is being opened more frequently to reduce flood threats as the river's stage increasingly reaches the threshold for opening it. Significant water quality impairments in the coastal zone will appear or be sustained with these openings. These data may be useful for climate change assessments through modeling or synthetic assessments in combination with other data sets.	[Turner, R.

Flood risk management using flood control infrastructure (FCI) is a popular solution to prevent flood damage; however, this is receiving enormous criticism due to its negative impacts on urban ecosystems. Recently, there have been new approaches to flood risk management that gradually shifted the focus away from FCI, such as ecological infrastructure (EI) based approaches. However, the conventional thinking that cities cannot be safe without FCI seems an immutable one, especially in developing countries. This study firstly assessed human-river interaction in direct relation to FCI and outlined the limitations of FCI. Then, an urban ecology research model was used to conduct a case study in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), in which the interaction between factors, including riverine urbanization, FCI formation dynamics, the changing hydrological regime, flood risk, and riverine ecosystem degradation were evaluated. Due to the dynamism and complexity of the interactions between humans and rivers at the VMD, this study attempts to demonstrate that building the ability to adapt to flood risks based on EI will have a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability of delta cities. Through a case study in My Tho City (MTC) a flood resilience management scenario for a riverine urban area along the Mekong River was developed to discuss the role of EI in flood risk reduction and the restoration of riverine native ecosystems. The findings from this study suggests that EI should be considered as an effective and indispensable design tool for the conservation of riparian ecological corridors and public open spaces-which is a major challenge for urban areas in the context of increasing climate change impacts in the VMD.

Coastal flood risk within a peri-urban area: SUSSEX Inlet district, SE Australia	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Coastal; Flooding; Hazard; Exposure; Vulnerability; Risk triangle	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; WATER	The peri-urban interface (PUI) exhibits characteristic qualities of both urban and rural regions, and this complexity has meant that risk assessments and long-term planning for PUI are lagging, despite these areas representing new developing settlement frontiers. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by modifying an existing approach to quantify and assess flood risk. The risk triangle framework was used to map exposure, vulnerability and biophysical variables; however, in a novel application, the risk triangle framework was adapted by presuming that there is a variation in the degree of exposure, vulnerability and biophysical variables. Within Australia and globally, PUIs are often coastal, and flood risk associated with rainfall and coastal inundation poses considerable risk to communities in the PUI; these risks will be further exacerbated should projections of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events and accelerating sea-level rise eventuate. An indicator-based approach using the risk triangle framework that maps flood hazard, exposure and vulnerability was used to integrate the biophysical and socio-economic flooding risk for communities in PUI of the St Georges Basin and Sussex Inlet catchments of south-eastern Australia. Integrating the flood risk triangle with future scenarios of demographic and climate change, and considering factors that contribute to PUI flood risk, facilitated the identification of planning strategies that would reduce the future rate of increase in flood risk. These planning strategies are useful for natural resource managers and land use planners across Australia and globally, who are tasked with balancing socio-economic prosperity for a changing population, whilst maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services and values. The indicator-based approach used in this study provides a cost-effective first-pass risk assessment and is a valuable tool for decision makers planning for flood risk across PUIs in NSW and globally.

It is already known that, until the end of the 21st century, the mean sea level (MSL) will rise at a global scale, but its effects at the local scale need to be further analyzed. In this context, a numerical modelling tool and a methodological approach for the river Minho estuary (NW of the Iberian Peninsula) are presented, to predict possible consequences of local MSL rise, considering the greenhouse emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Hydrodynamic and morphodynamic impacts were analyzed considering several driving factors, such as tides, sea level rise, storm surge, wave set-up, and different river flood peak discharges, taking into account their probabilities of occurrence. The model was calibrated using in-situ data and a data assimilation tool, the OpenDA, which automates this process, allowing to reach reliable results in a considerably short time when compared with traditional techniques. The results forecast that the predicted MSL rise will reduce the flow velocity magnitude and the sediment transport into the coastal platform but will aggravate the inundation risks along the estuarine banks. In the worst scenario (RCP 8.5) the water level near the river mouth of the estuary is expected to rise 0.20 m for 50 years return period ocean water rising, and 0.60 m for 100 years return period. It was also possible to identify that floods are the most important driver for the sediment transport along the estuary, while the tide effect in the morphodynamics is restricted to the downstream estuarine region. This work demonstrated the importance of the numerical modelling tools to better understand the effects of climate change at local scales through the representation of the estuarine hydrodynamic pattern evolution for future climate scenarios.

Quantifying Extreme Precipitation Forecasting Skill in High-Resolution Models Using Spatial Patterns: A Case Study of the 2016 and 2018 Ellicott City Floods	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						hydrometeorology; spatial analysis; precipitation verification; extreme flood	OBJECT-BASED VERIFICATION; CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; UNITED-STATES; HRRR MODEL; PART I; RAIN; RADAR; METHODOLOGY; HYDROLOGY; DAMAGE	Recent historic floods in Ellicott City, MD, on 30 July 2016 and 27 May 2018 provide stark examples of the types of floods that are expected to become more frequent due to urbanization and climate change. Given the profound impacts associated with flood disasters, it is crucial to evaluate the capability of state-of-the-art weather models in predicting these hydrometeorological events. This study utilizes an object-based approach to evaluate short range (<12 h) hourly forecast precipitation from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) versus observations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV precipitation analysis. For both datasets, a binary precipitation field is delineated using thresholds that span trace to extreme precipitation rates. Next, spatial metrics of area, perimeter, solidity, elongation, and fragmentation, as well as centroid positions for the forecast and observed fields are calculated. A Mann-Whitney U-test reveals biases (using a confidence level of 90%) related to the spatial attributes and locations of model forecast precipitation. Results indicate that traditional pixel-based precipitation verification metrics are limited in their ability to quantify and characterize model skill. In contrast, an object-based methodology offers encouraging results in that the HRRR can skillfully predict the extreme precipitation rates that are anticipated with anthropogenic climate change. Yet, there is still room for improvement, since model forecasts of extreme convective rainfall tend to be slightly too numerous and fragmented compared with observations. Lastly, results are sensitive to the HRRR model's representation of synoptic-scale and mesoscale processes. Therefore, detailed surface analyses and an "ingredients-based" approach should remain central to the process of forecasting excessive rainfall.

Projected changes of temperature extremes over nine major basins in China based on the CMIP5 multimodel ensembles	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Temperature extremes; Projected changes; ETCCDI; CMIP5; China	BEIJIANG RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; FLOOD FREQUENCY; ZHUJIANG RIVER; TRENDS; MODEL; IMPACTS; UNCERTAINTIES; SCENARIOS	Based on the outputs of 27 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), projected changes of extreme temperature events have been analyzed over nine river basins in China by the end of the twenty-first century relative to the reference period 1961-1990. The temporal and spatial changes and their projection uncertainty are studied using the extreme temperature indices defined by the Expert Team of Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The model simulations predict a general increasing (decreasing) trend in warm (cold) extremes over China in the twenty-first century, with more pronounced warming trend under a higher emission scenario. The projected changes in cold and warm extremes exhibit a large difference in spatial patterns. The high-latitude and high-elevation regions of China (e.g., Continental and Southwest basins) are projected to respond more strongly to changes in cold extremes, while eastern and southern China (e.g., Yangtze River and Pearl River basins) tend to be more sensitive to the increases in warm extremes. In general, projected changes in cold indices based on minimum temperature tend to be more pronounced than in warm indices based on maximum temperature. Uncertainty analysis shows a large difference among the 27 GCMs under 2 RCP scenarios, and the uncertainty ranges tend to be larger under a higher emission scenario. Overall, the uncertainties in the emission scenarios are smaller than those from the climate models in the near future period. However, for the long-term climate projections (e.g., by the end of the twenty-first century), the projected difference under various emission scenarios tends to be larger than those by different climate models and hence can be the dominant contributor to the projection uncertainty of temperature indices.

Hybrid approaches that combine grey infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) have been applied as an adaptive and resilient strategy to cope with climate change uncertainties and incorporate other co-benefits. This research aims to investigate the feasibility of Real Time Control (RTC) for NBS operation in order to reduce flooding and improve their effectiveness. The study area is the irrigation and drainage system of the Rangsit Area in Thailand. The results show that during the normal flood events, the RTC system effectively reduces water level at the Western Raphiphat Canal Station compared to the system without RTC or with additional storage. Moreover, the RTC system facilitates achieving the required minimum volume and increasing the volume in the retentions. These findings highlight the potential of using RTC to improve the irrigation and drainage system operation as well as NBS implementation to reduce flooding. The RTC system can also assists in equitable water distribution between Klongs and retention areas, while also increasing the water storage in the retention areas. This additional water storage can be utilized for agricultural purposes, providing further benefits. These results represent an essential starting point for the development of Smart Solutions and Digital Twins in utilizing Real-Time Control for flood reduction and water allocation in the Rangsit Area in Thailand.

The aim of this paper is to apply a climate risk assessment framework to evaluate the impacts of extreme temperatures on several Italian airports: Malpensa, Linate, Bergamo, Ciampino, Fiumicino, Napoli, Catania, Palermo, and Cagliari. According to the risk definition recommended in the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC (2014), specific hazard, exposure and vulnerability indicators were identified. The hazard indicators were calculated using the UERRA regional reanalysis for the observed period (1981-2010), and then their climate variations were evaluated by means an ensemble of highresolution climate projections from the EURO-CORDEX initiative for the near (2021-2050), medium (2041-2070), and long-term future period (2071-2100), under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Exposure and vulnerability data were collected from multiple sources, such as official airports documents or websites. The final risk index obtained from the combination of these three factors allowed us to identify which of the selected airports are probable to face the major impacts due to extreme temperature events. This paper provides the knowledge base on risk assessment on Italian airports, with the aim to support the stakeholders for the selection and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies and measures in relation to extreme temperatures.

Sea level change would increase erosion in coastal areas, result in intrusion into water supplies, inundate coastal marshes and other important habitats, and make the coastal property more vulnerable to erosion and flooding. This situation coincides with the massive socio-economic development of the coastal city areas. The coastal areas of the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia are vulnerable to sea -level change, flooding, and extreme erosion events. The monthly Mean Sea Level (MSL) change was simulated by using two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, Feed Forward-Neural Network (FF-NN) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous-Neural Network (NARX-NN) models. Both models did well in recreating sea levels and their fluctuating patterns, according to the data. The NARX-NN model with architecture (5-6-1) and four lag options, on the other hand, got the greatest results. The findings of the model's mean sea level rise simulation show that Kuala Terengganu would have a growing and upward trend of roughly 25.34 mm/year. This paper shows that the eastern coast of Malaysia is highly vulnerable to sea-level rise and therefore, requires sustainable adaptation policies and plans to manage the potential impacts. It recommends that various policies, which enable areas to be occupied for longer before the eventual retreat, could be adapted to accommodate vulnerable settlements on the eastern coast of Malaysia.

Based on hydrological station datasets from 12 typical rivers with annual maximum peak discharge and peaks-over-threshold (POT) flood series for the period 1970-2019, the spatial and temporal variations of flooding in 12 rivers were detected using a linear regression estimator and Mann-Kendall trend tests. New hydrological insights: The results indicate that the frequency of POT floods in 12 rivers during 1970-2019 showed an increasing trend at the 90% significance level, with an increasing trend for small floods and decreasing trends for medium and large floods. Flood levels varied from east to west across the region, with an overall decreasing trend in the east, an increase in small floods in the central rivers, and significant increases in both small and medium floods in the west. Both temperature and precipitation increased after 1987, and summer precipitation was a significantly increased; as a result, POT floods in most rivers increased after the 1980 s, and trends in flood frequency showed decreases in spring and autumn and an increase in summer. The main causes of the changes in flood frequency were found to be heavy rainfall, abnormal warming, and accelerated glacial melting.

The comparative analysis of the historical and current land cover/uses helps to better understand changing flood regimes. Based on historical cadastre maps from 1826 to 1859, the land cover/uses in the Austrian catchments of the rivers Rhine, Salzach and Drava were reconstructed to almost the level of exact plots of land. Catchment-wide analysis reveals a six-fold expansion of settlement areas, a decline of arable land by 69% and a shrinking of the formerly glaciated areas by 73% until 2016. In the Alpine fluvial corridors, i.e. flood-prone areas at the valley floors and valley sides at ca. 300-year floods, settlements even expanded 7.5-fold, severely increasing the potential for flood damages. At the same time, the overall channel area of running waters has been reduced by 40% and 95% the formerly large wetlands have been lost. Overall, the fluvial corridors were truncated by 203 km(2) or 14%, thereby reducing flood retention capacity. The concentration of intensive forms of human land uses at lower altitudes, coupled with an upward shift of less intensively used, near-natural forms of land cover, has led to a both spatial and vertical separation of Alpine landscape features over the long term. Warmer temperatures due to climate change are expected to promote the demonstrated upward shifts of Alpine vegetation.

Identification of Seasonal Streamflow Regimes and Streamflow Drivers for Daily and Peak Flows in Alaska	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Alaska; flood&#8208; generating processes; flow regime; glaciers; hierarchical classification; seasonality	ON-SNOW EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUNOFF; CLASSIFICATION; PROJECTIONS; CATCHMENTS; DIVISIONS; FREQUENCY; GLACIERS; IMPACTS	Alaska is among northern high-latitude regions where accelerated climate change is expected to impact streamflow properties, including seasonality and primary flow drivers. Evaluating changes to streamflow, including flood characteristics, across this large and diverse environment can be improved by identifying the distribution and influence of flow drivers. Using metrics of mean monthly streamflow data from 253 streamgages, seasonal flow regimes were clustered to guide identification of seasonal flow drivers and form hydrologic groups for identification of peak-flow populations. Nine seasonally distinct subclasses described variability within three classes dominated by (mostly fall) rainfall, (spring) snowmelt, and (summer) high-elevation melt. The most glacierized basins exclusively grouped into high-elevation melt subclasses, and less glacierized basins sometimes exhibited seasonal patterns aligned with rainfall-dominated and snowmelt-dominated regimes. Peak-flow populations varied by subclass from dominant rainfall or dominant snowmelt to mixed rainfall-snowmelt or mixed rainfall, snowmelt, and high-elevation melt. Within subclasses, rainfall generated higher mean peak flows (relative to mean annual flow) than snowmelt or high-elevation melt. Seasonal flow regimes showed clear but complex associations with basin characteristics, primarily elevation and winter temperature, and with geographic location. These dependencies provided elevation-based analogies for changes associated with warming and insights for seasonal flow regime prediction and hydrologic region delineation. These results provide a spatially comprehensive perspective on seasonal streamflow drivers across Alaska from historical data and serve as an important historical basis for analysis.

Evaluating adaptation measures for reducing flood risk: A case study in the city of Colombo, Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood risk; Adaptation measures; Damage-curves; Wetlands; Colombo	DAMAGE ASSESSMENT	Many cities around the world face frequent problems with flooding, which is expected to get worse due to anthropogenic climate change and further urbanization. To tackle these problems often local infrastructural adaptation measures are proposed. In this study a chain of state-of-the-art models is presented that can be used to evaluate the benefits of such measures. Also, a method is presented to calculate the costs of not responding to a changing environment that is slowly aggravating floods. These methods are applied to a case study in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Colombo faces problems with floods that are expected to get worse by further wetland reduction and climate change. Several local measures (infrastructural interventions) are proposed to tackle that problem. This paper shows a method to quantify the expected reduction in future flood damages resulting from the proposed measures, and compares the risk reduction to the proposed measure costs. This is done by creating probabilistic inundation depth maps using a 1D2D hydrodynamic model. A detailed flood damage model and socio-economic development scenarios are then applied to estimate damage with and without the measures. An economic analysis is done to demonstrate the benefits of the measures, which can be used by decision makers. Additionally, calculations are carried out of future flood risk increases when wetland reduction in Colombo continues. In this case, the effect of stopping wetland encroachment is found to be larger than the effect of the structural adaptation measures.	[Wagenaar, D. J.; Diermanse, F. L. M.; Gehrels, J.

J	Durand, F				Durand, FRANcom			Insects and food security in South Africa in the light of climate change	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			Afrikaans	Review						entomophagy; insects; black soldier flies; BSF; starvation; global climate change; food security; animal feed; methane; waste dump; sustainability; water use	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; WASTE; FEED	The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating socio-economic effect on the country, including the death of more than 102 000 people, many of whom were the breadwinners of their families. This could not have happened at a worse time, since the economy of the country was in a recession even before the pandemic. The situation is exacerbated by the highest level of unemployment in the world, widespread nepotism and corruption, the plundering of state coffers and the favouring of the business interests of BRICS partners by government officials over those of South Africans. The government's commitment to prioritising their BRICS partners' business interests over those of the South African people contributes to food insecurity in South Africa. This includes the export of coal from mines in Mpumalanga to China and India, while nothing is done to rehabilitate the region, which was once known for its agriculture. The government handed over to the Chinese company SAEMB the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone, where four opencast mines, a 3 300 MW power station and an iron smelting plant will be developed. This development, however, requires the government to build a dam that will harvest 60% of the annual runoff of the Limpopo River, which in turn will have a devastating effect on farmers and communities downriver in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique who irrigate their crops with water from the Limpopo River. The same kowtowing of the South African government to its BRICS partners can be seen in the reluctance with which the government responds to the plundering of our marine resources by Chinese fishing boats and abalone smugglers. The unfair competition imposed on local chicken farmers by distributers of dumped chicken, mainly from Brazil, with the approval of government, caused the closure of several South African chicken farms and the resulting loss of tens of thousands of jobs along the supply chain. The reluctance of the government to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war is partly linked to the fact that South Africa imports fertilizer and wheat from Russia. South Africa, a water-scarce country, is more vulnerable than many other countries to the effects of global climate change. The abnormal rain pattern, that is characterised by severe droughts in certain regions and heavy rainstorms and floods in others, has a devastating impact on the already economically struggling South African community. Abroad, attempts are made to ensure that mean temperatures do not exceed the pre-industrial level mark by more than 1,5 degrees C. South Africa, however, heats up twice as fast as many other countries, and has already exceeded the pre-industrial era level by more than 2 degrees C; it will continue to get warmer and drier, causing most of the country to become desertified by 2050. A third of South African rivers do not reach the sea anymore because of over abstraction of water from rivers; similarly, there is extensive abstraction of groundwater. Together farming and forestry account for 70% of water use in South Africa. This over abstraction of water, worsened by the heat and aridification resulting from climate change, led to the degradation of most wetland and estuarine ecosystems and the drying and burning of irreplaceable peatlands. These political, socioeconomic and environmental calamities create the worst possible scenario for food security in South Africa. Already one in four people in Africa suffers from food insecurity and this number will rapidly rise in the wake of global climate change, which will result in the loss of two thirds of arable land by 2025. South Africa is nearing socioeconomic collapse. This, in conjunction with continuing droughts, storms and rising temperatures associated with global climate change, will lead to food insecurity, starvation and anarchy. The effect of global climate change will make it progressively more difficult to produce enough food for the South African population. It is imperative that South Africans consider alternative methods of food production, including water use. Entomophagy is widely practiced throughout the world, but is especially prevalent in South America, the Far East and Africa, where approximately 2 billion people use 1 900 species of insects as food. The nutritional value of insects is unsurpassed and, in some respects, even more nutritious than meat. The larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens are a source of high-quality proteins and unsaturated fats that are used worldwide as animal feed. Insects are a source of minerals such as iron, calcium, copper, zinc and magnesium and high levels of vitamin A, B 2 and C. The ecological and socioeconomic benefits of using BSF larvae instead of grain as feed for fish, chickens and pigs are enormous. BSF larvae can be bred almost for free by feeding it a wide variety of organic waste, including rotten vegetables and fruit, manure and even carcases that would have ended up in rubbish dumps and would have contributed to the methane and carbon dioxide pollution emanating from such dumps. The water use of BSF is negligible, because the water in the organic waste that would have been discarded in waste dumps is sufficient to sustain them. BSF affords the subsistence and small-scale farmer the opportunity to raise chickens at a lower input cost than ever before. The conversion of feed to food in insects is far greater than that of chickens, pigs or cattle. In the case of the house cricket (Acheta domestica) the conversion rate of feed to food is twice as effective as that of chickens, four times as effective as pigs and twelve times greater than that of cattle. Compared to conventional farming, this implies that with insects far more exceptionally nutritious food can be produced in a smaller area, with little water and no poison or fertilizer whatsoever, while waste and the associated methane gas are removed from the environment at the same time. A few South African companies have already seen the potential of insects as food and feed. Even though insect farming is still in its infancy, it is already generating jobs and new socioeconomic opportunities in South Africa. Insect farming, especially BSF farming, will in the near future probably grow in popularity all over the world as an affordable, healthy, ecologically sustainable alternative food source that will, directly or indirectly, be consumed by humans. BSF afford the environmentally conscious homesteader who wants to produce livestock such as chickens, fish, or pigs in a sustainable manner an unsurpassed environmentally friendly alternative. BSF will also give the desperate, impoverished and starving population of the future an alternative free source of feed that will offer them economic prospects and food security.

VULNERABILITY; INFORMATION; RESILIENCE; IMPACT; EXTENT; LAND; RISK	Floods caused by extreme weather events and climate change have increased in occurrence and severity all over the world, resulting in devastation and disruption of activities. Researchers and policy practitioners have increasingly paid attention to the role of critical infrastructure (CI) in disaster risk reduction, flood resilience and climate change adaptation in terms of its backbone functions in maintaining societal services in hazard attacks. The analysed city in this study, Xinxiang (Henan province, China), was affected by an extreme flood event that occurred on 17-23 July 2021, which caused great socio-economic losses. However, few studies have focused on medium-sized cities and the flood cascading effects on CI during this event. Therefore, this study explores the damages caused by this flooding event with links to CI, such as health services, energy supply stations, shelters and transport facilities (HEST infrastructure). To achieve this, the study first combines RGB (red, green blue) composition and supervised classification for flood detection to monitor and map flood inundation areas. Second, it manages a multiscenario simulation and evaluates the cascading effects on HEST infrastructure. Diverse open-source data are employed, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Landsat-8 OIL data, point-of-interest (POI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The study reveals that this extreme flood event has profoundly affected croplands and villagers. Due to the revisiting period of Sentinel-1 SAR data, four scenarios are simulated to portray the retreated but 'omitted' floodwater: Scenario 0 is the flood inundation area on 27 July, and Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are built based on this information with a buffer of 50, 100 and 150 m outwards, respectively. In the four scenarios, as the inundation areas expand, the affected HEST infrastructure becomes more clustered at the centre of the core study area, indicating that those located in the urban centre are more susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, the affected transport facilities assemble in the north and east of the core study area, implying that transport facilities located in the north and east of the core study area are more susceptible to flooding. The verification of the flood inundation maps and affected HEST infrastructure in the scenario simulation support the series method adopted in this study. The findings of this study can be used by flood managers, urban planners and other decision makers to better understand extreme historic weather events in China, improve flood resilience and decrease the negative impacts of such events on HEST infrastructure.

In March 2021, a 450 km stretch of the eastern NSW coastline experienced a La Nina-related rainfall event over several days, resulting in large volumes of freshwater ingress to marine systems. Port Stephens, an estuary 250 km north of Sydney, recorded its highest week of rainfall on record. This was followed by two more flood events in March 2022 and June 2022. Prior to 2021, the marine-dominant Eastern Port of Port Stephens was home to the world's largest aggregations of Dendronephthya australis, an endangered species of soft coral endemic to the south-east coast of Australia. Using data from a 2019-2022 D. australis monitoring program in Port Stephens, spanning the unprecedented series of flood events in 2021-2022, we detail the impacts of flood events on the population. Prior to the floods, aggregations of colonies were persisting, and individuals were growing at two of the four monitored sites. However, flooding in March 2021 caused a 91% decline in the remaining areal extent of D. australis. Modelling of likely causative factors highlighted water depth as the most significant environmental variable correlated with coral loss. Corals in shallower waters experienced lower salinity and were the most impacted. Continued monitoring during 2021 and 2022 documented the loss of all remaining aggregations in the estuary after further La Nina-related rainfall events, to the point where D. australis is now on the brink of localised extinction.

J	Peker, E; Ilhan, A				Peker, Ender; Ilhan, Akgun			Catalysing the realisation of rainwater harvesting systems through participatory action research	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Rainwater harvesting; Water management; Urban planning; Participatory action research; Climate change; Decentralised governance	MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; WATER; HOUSEHOLD; QUALITY; CYCLE	Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one the most salient methods in urban water management for creating an additional water supply in times of drought and combating urban floods in the face of climate change. Instalment of RWH systems has become compulsory by national legislation in Turkiye since 2021. However, previous research shows that there are a variety of barriers to implementing RWH, including legislative regulations, technical dimensions, financial mechanisms, societal adaptation and governance dynamics. Taking this as a point of departure, this research explores necessary actions to overcome those barriers in collaboration with relevant actors, aiming to catalyse the realisation of RWH systems throughout the research process. The research adopts a participatory action research (PAR) methodology, generating knowledge that is meaningful for urban planning systems and water management institutions involved in RWH installation and operation. The research explores the necessary actions through the case of Istanbul, the largest metropolis of Turkiye. Respectively, a set of workshops, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and group meetings were implemented in parallel processes with different actors from the public and private institutions at local, regional, and national scales. The findings highlight the need for (i) legislative actions for constructing a thorough regulatory framework, (ii) financial actions for introducing new incentives and pricing policies, (iii) technical actions for developing installation and operation standards, (iv) societal actions for igniting a cultural change for the use of RWH in the society and (v) governance actions for RWH systems. The research establishes a communicative environment that showcases the feasibility of collaboration and emphasizes the importance of its continuous implementation in establishing a decentralised governance mechanism involving all actors.

Long-term impacts of climate change on coastal and transitional eco-systems in India: an overview of its current status, future projections, solutions, and policies	RSC ADVANCES			English	Review							TECHNOLOGY-LINKED INVENTORY; MULTI-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS; WESTERN ARABIAN SEA; TROPICAL CYCLONES; MONSOON RAINFALL; ZONE MANAGEMENT; STORM-SURGE; TRENDS; OCEAN; EVENTS	Urbanization and industrial development are increasing rapidly. These are accompanied by problems of population explosion, encroachment of agricultural, and construction lands, increased waste generation, effluent release, and escalated concentrations of several greenhouse gases (GHGs) and pollutants in the atmosphere. This has led to wide-scale adverse impacts. Visible effects are fluctuations in temperatures and precipitation, rising sea levels, unpredictable floods, storms and cyclones, and disruption to coastal and transitional ecosystems. In a country like India with a massive population of nearly 1.4 billion and around 420 million people dwelling on or near the coasts, this effect is pre-dominant. India has extensive coastlines on both sides that are subject to greater contact and high impact from the water bodies. The factors impacting climate change, its consequences, and future predictions must be analyzed immediately for implementing precautionary measures to ameliorate the detrimental effects. Several endemic species have been endangered as these changes have resulted in the loss of habitat and interfered with the food webs. Climatic impacts on transitional ecosystems also need to be considered to preserve the diversity of each. The cooperation of governmental, independent organizations and policymakers throughout the world is essential to control and mediate the impacts on health, agriculture, and other related sectors, the details of which have been elaborated in this review. The review analyses the trends in climatic variation with time and discusses a few extremities which have left permanent effects on the population primarily concerning the coastal - Indian scenario and its eco-systems.

Various general circulation models (GCMs) were utilized to create historical (1986-2014) and future (2022-2100) scenarios to assess the risk of flooding due to changes in flow under future climatic conditions using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The delta correction (DC) method was used to correct biases in the CMIP6 data to reduce uncertainty. Based on precise multimodal coupling data, different statistical distributions such as the generalized extreme value (GEV), Log-Pearson's Type III, and Gumbel distribution were used to assess the flood return period for various climate conditions. The delta change method (DCM) was utilized to estimate future peak flows, where the delta change factor (DCF) assisted in estimating different design flood events. SSP 3-7.0 had the highest projected streamflow out of all the projections along with final processing results from Hec-GeoRAS which was processed into HEC-RAS model to generate flood hazard maps and flood inundation maps. The future flow was then used to estimate and project the future floods flow. The results from the calibration and validation revealed good simulation of the river Chenab streamflow values of HEC-RAS. The results indicate that flood inundation extent will increase in the future, suggesting a higher flood hazard. This study emphasizes the significance of projecting future flood hazards and using predicted climate data to obtain crucial evidence for developing effective floodplain management strategies.

Studying drought-flood events and their driving factors is essential for wetland resource planning and management. However, climate change and human activities present dynamic challenges that traditional approaches are unable to simulate dynamically in a rapidly changing environment. This makes quantitative analysis difficult. Our research focused on the innovative use of the data stream model, namely online bagging of Hoeffding adaptive trees, to quantify drought and flood drivers in response to climate change and human activity. The proposed approach was applied to a river-lake system, the Dongting Lake wetland. The frequency and duration characteristics of drought-flood events were analyzed. In addition, the cyclical changes of droughts and floods were analyzed by wavelet analysis. Then, drought-flood indicators as well as climatic and hydrological factors were entered into a dynamic data stream model for quantitative calculations. The results showed that the water conservancy projects largely reduced flood events while aggravating droughts. The frequency of floods decreased by 4.91% and the frequency of droughts increased by 6.81% following the construction of the Gezhouba Hydro-project and the Three Gorges Dam. Precipitation and Sankou streamflow were two dominant factors in the Dongting Lake drought and flood events, both of which had a feature importance value of approximately 0.3. This research showed how the data stream model can be used in a changing environment and the applicability of the conclusions reached through real-world instances. Moreover, these quantitative outputs can help in the sustainable utilization of Dongting Lake wetland resources.

Understanding how runoff responds to changes in hydrologic processes and conditions induced by permafrost thaw is critical for water resources management in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. In this study, we analyzed streamflow recession characteristics for 1964-2016 for the Tahe watershed located at the southern margin of the permafrost region in Eurasia. Results reveal a link between streamflow recession and permafrost degradation as indicated by the statistical analyses of streamflow and the modeled ground warming and active layer thickening. The recession constant and the active layer temperatures at depths of 5, 40, 100, and 200 cm simulated by the backpropagation neural network model significantly increased during the study period from 1972 to 2020 due to intensified climate warming in northeastern China. The onset of seasonal active layer thaw was advanced by 10 days, and the modeled active layer thickness increased by 54 cm in this period. The average annual streamflow recession time increased by 11.5 days (+ 53 %) from the warming period (1972-1988) to the thawing period (1989-2016), with these periods determined from breakpoint analysis. These hydrologic changes arose from increased catchment storage and were correlated to increased active layer thickness and longer seasonal thawing periods. These results highlight that permafrost degradation can significantly extend the recession flow duration in a watershed underlain by discontinuous, sporadic, and isolated permafrost, and thereby alter flooding dynamics and water resources in the southern margin of the Eurasian permafrost region.

Gravel barrier resilience to future sea level rise and storms	MARINE GEOLOGY			English	Article						Coastal resilience; Gravel barrier; Storm surge; Sea level rise; Coastal risk	DOMINATED COASTAL BARRIERS; CENTRAL LONG-ISLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIDAL INLET; HOLOCENE TRANSGRESSION; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; FLOOD; RETREAT	Globally, communities, ecosystems, and assets situated within the coastal zone will likely experience increased risk in the future owing to chronic and acute pressures associated with climate change and accompanying sea level rise. Gravel barrier islands represent an intermediate pathway between seaward hazards and vulnerable landward receptors and possess inherent morpho-sedimentary characteristics which allow coastal risk reduction functions. If gravel barriers are to be usefully and reliably integrated into broader coastal risk management strategies, there is a need to understand the extent to which these landforms are likely to remain resilient under future environmental conditions. Using the Blakeney Point Barrier System, southern North Sea, this study investigates the resilience of gravel barrier landforms to storm surge conditions under future sea level rise scenarios. Resilience is assessed through reference to barrier resistance, susceptibility to state change, persistence, and continued functional performance. Numerical modelling reveals that variable pre-surge barrier morphologies result in a spectrum of episodic resilience trajectories along the barrier frontage. This study also considers the role of humans in altering landscape resilience, demonstrating that previously managed barrier sections (through reprofiling to steepen and heighten the barrier) are more vulnerable to severe morphological change, and associated landward overtopping volume, compared to unmanaged barrier sections. This said, under moderate to high sea level rise, even unmanaged barrier sections failed to demonstrate resilience to storm surge forcing. Such insights help temper our expectations regarding the coastal erosion and flood risk reduction functions of gravel barriers in the face of global environmental change.	[Pollard, J.

Panel data evidence from Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						MODIS satellite Imagery; Natural hazards; Climate change; Extreme weather events; Time use	NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; VULNERABILITY; HOUSEHOLD; RESILIENCE; WOMEN; TIME; VARIABILITY; ALLOCATION	This study examines how large-scale environmental shocks alter the gender division of labor in traditional rural societies. Using individual-level time allocation data from the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey 2012, 2013, and 2014, I compare hours spent per week across productive and reproductive activities of more than 8000 adult men and women after the 2011, 2012, and 2013 floods in 76 villages from three provinces of Pakistan. Individual-level panel data is combined with village-level flood inundation depth data collected using remotely sensed (MODIS) satellite imagery. The panel fixed-effects regression results reveal a significant shift in the gender division of labor for both paid and unpaid work in the flood-affected villages. For a 1-m flood inundation depth, men's and women's weekly time use as hired labor increased by -2 and -1 h, respectively, women's weekly time allocation on child and elderly care decreased by -1.5 h, and men's weekly labor allocation for reproductive work and fuel collection increased by -2 h. Overall, a 1-m inundation depth increased the weekly time allocation for all activities for men by -6 h and women by -2 h. Women's time allocation changes were most pronounced for landless and marginal agricultural landowners (<0.5 ha), when compared with medium and large landowners. The favorable shift in the gender division of reproductive work was positively associated with women's decision-making power. Men who believed that both men and women should equally participate in income generation activities were more likely to increase their reproductive work time.

To respond to this threat, the structure of the delta's agriculture-based economy must transform, becoming more adaptive to changing conditions. One adaptive livelihood option is the use of flood-based farming systems in the upper VMD. The present study examines local perceptions of such a system in Dong Thap Province, a lowland, flood-affected area of the upper VMD. Specifically, we explored lotus farming as a potential flood-based adaptive livelihood model for the region. The study advances the current literature by using historical research, embedded in narrative analysis applying the social construction of technology (SCOT) lens. We collected data through in-depth interviews and field surveys to qualitatively analyze the emergence and status of lotus cultivation in the study area, zooming in on how local society evolved with expansion of this farming model. The findings suggest that as an innovative idea, lotus farming initially emerged due to unfavorable natural conditions, and then was developed as an attractive nature-based livelihood, and thus received increased attention. It has been accepted and modified over time according to the new interests of further stepped-in stakeholders. Our findings echo the social construction of technology perspective as we found lotus farming to be a technological artifact that did not develop on its own, by was driven by different interpretations and re-negotiation process. This made more room for stakeholders to shape and reshape it in a way that fits their interests.

J	Yu, G; Wright, DB; Li, Z				Yu, Guo; Wright, Daniel B.; Li, Zhe			The Upper Tail of Precipitation in Convection-Permitting Regional Climate Models and Their Utility in Nonstationary Rainfall and Flood Frequency Analysis	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						process&#8208; based flood hydrology; stochastic storm transposition; rainfall and flood frequency analysis; convection&#8208; permitting regional climate models	BIAS CORRECTION; DATA ASSIMILATION; STATIONARITY; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DROUGHT; RADAR; RISK	Computational advances have made atmospheric modeling at convection-permitting (<= 4 km) grid spacings increasingly feasible. These simulations hold great promise in the projection of climate change impacts including rainfall and flood extremes. The relatively short model runs that are currently feasible, however, inhibit the assessment of the upper tail of rainfall and flood quantiles using conventional statistical methods. Stochastic storm transposition (SST) and process-based flood frequency analysis are two approaches that together can help to mitigate this limitation. SST generates large numbers of extreme rainfall scenarios by temporal resampling and geospatial transposition of rainfall fields from relatively short data sets. Coupling SST with process-based flood frequency analysis enables exploration of flood behavior at a range of spatial and temporal scales. We apply these approaches with outputs of 13-year simulations of regional climate to examine changes in extreme rainfall and flood quantiles up to the 500-year recurrence interval in a medium-sized watershed in the Midwestern United States. Intensification of extreme precipitation across a range of spatial and temporal scales is identified in future climate; changes in flood magnitudes depend on watershed area, with small watersheds exhibiting the greatest increases due to their limited capacity to attenuate flood peaks. Flood seasonality and snowmelt are predicted to be earlier in the year under projected warming, while the most extreme floods continue to occur in early summer. Findings highlight both the potential and limitations of convection-resolving climate models to help understand possible changes in rainfall and flood frequency across watershed scales.

The studied sites were mostly from the Classical Karst which is situated in the NW part of Dinarides and some from the Slovenian Southern Alps. Protected in caves, sediments are generally well preserved and reveal an exceptionally good, multi-proxy record of surface environmental conditions at the time of their deposition. Here we describe results of the systematic acquisition of palaeomagnetic data within individual segments of studied sediment sections with special focus on relict and unroofed caves. In intervals with polarity change, the frequency of sampling was so high that almost continuous records of rockmagnetic and palaeomagnetic parameters were obtained. The construction of high-resolution magnetostratigraphic profile supported magnetostratigraphy correlations among profiles. Palaeomagnetic and magnetostratigraphy results were calibrated by relative, numerical, calibrated and correlated dating methods, where possible. Age sequences were compiled from spatially and temporally highly discontinuous sediment records covering different ages within the Cenozoic era. The robust chronology was constructed. Calibrated data contributed to the interpretation of speleogenesis, deposition mechanism in caves, and indirectly to the time of karst evolution and the succession of tectonic phases and climate changes. The research indicated that most of sediments in relict and unroofed caves are up to 5 Ma old which contrasts to the traditional concept of Pleistocene age of cave sediments and that caves themselves are not much older. Cave sediments have proven to be an important source of information on depositional style in caves which indirectly reflected the evolution of the surrounding landscape especially the evolution of catchment areas - i.e. climatic changes with flood events or/and changes of the tectonic regimes during Cenozoic.

However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small-scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multivariable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multivariable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90% prediction intervalsfor Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78% (totalling U.S.$3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models.

By removing vegetation and soil, grading the land surface and saturating soil air content, urban developments are more likely to be flooded, which will be further exacerbated by an anticipated increase in the number of intense rainfall events, due to climate change. To date, data collected show that urban pluvial flood events are on the rise for both the UK and China. This paper presents a critical review of existing sustainable approaches to urban flood management, by comparing UK practice with that in China and critically assessing whether lessons can be learnt from the Sponge City initiative. The authors have identified a strategic research plan to ensure that the sponge city initiative can successfully respond to extreme climatic events and tackle pluvial flooding. Hence, this review suggests that future research should focus on (1) the development of a more localized rainfall model for the Chinese climate; (2) the role of retrofit SuDS (Sustainable Drainage Systems) in challenging water environments; (3) the development of a robust SuDS selection tool, ensuring that the most effective devices are installed, based on local factors; and (4) dissemination of current information, and increased understanding of maintenance and whole life-costing, alongside monitoring the success of sponge cities to increase the confidence of decision makers (5) the community engagement and education about sponge cities.

While seasonal changes have been studied extensively, studies on changes in the timing and magnitude of annual extremes remain rare. This study investigates the effects of climate change on runoff patterns in six contrasting Alpine catchments in Austria using a process-based, semi-distributed hydrological model and projections from 14 regional and global climate model combinations for two representative concentration pathways, namely RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The study catchments represent a spectrum of different hydrological regimes, from pluvial-nival to nivo-glacial, as well as distinct topographies and land forms, characterizing different elevation zones across the eastern Alps to provide a comprehensive picture of future runoff changes. The climate projections are used to model river runoff in 2071-2100, which are then compared to the 1981-2010 reference period for all study catchments. Changes in the timing and magnitude of annual maximum and minimum flows, as well as in monthly runoff and snowmelt, are quantified and analyzed. Our results indicate a substantial shift to earlier occurrences in annual maximum flows by 9 to 31 d and an extension of the potential flood season by 1 to 3 months for high-elevation catchments. For low-elevation catchments, changes in the timing of annual maximum flows are less pronounced. Magnitudes of annual maximum flows are likely to increase by 2 %-18 % under RCP4.5, while no clear changes are projected for four catchments under RCP8.5. The latter is caused by a pronounced increase in evaporation and decrease in snowmelt contributions, which offset increases in precipitation. In the future, minimum annual runoff will occur 13-31 d earlier in the winter months for high-elevation catchments, whereas for low-elevation catchments a shift from winter to autumn by about 15-100 d is projected, with generally larger changes for RCP8.5. While all catchments show an increase in mean magnitude of minimum flows by 7-30% under RCP4.5, this is only the case for four catchments under RCP8.5. Our results suggest a relationship between the elevation of catchments and changes in the timing of annual maximum and minimum flows. For the magnitude of the extreme flows, a relationship is found between catchment elevation and annual minimum flows, whereas this relationship is lacking between elevation and annual maximum flow.

Environmental impacts regarding the failure of hydrological facilities, including the loss of sustainable habitats and clean water previously provided by reservoir, have raised concerns. In this study, the potential risks to hydrological infrastructure within the context of the 100-year joint probability of maximum rainfall and peak water stage were examined over the Mountain Island Dam (North Carolina, USA) for the period of 1950-2099. We found that nearly 92% of annual maximum extreme rainfall events were closely related to the passage of hurricanes over the dam's watershed over the 25 years of the validation period. The results show that the projected annual maximum precipitation is likely to intensify under the RCP8.5 climate scenario and the frequency of the annual precipitation maxima exceeding 100 mm/day is projected to increase in the future. Noticeably, it is found that even weaker storm events can contribute a significant amount of rainfall at inland locations. The probability of occurrence of a hurricane like Gustav is higher than that of a 100-year storm rainfall event under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, this type of storm rainfall will more likely occur near the Mountain Island Dam in the future. Inspectors should focus more on observing water level fluctuation and rainfall volume variation at station two under the same rainstorm - water level situations, because it is more sensitive to the once in a century co-occurrence event than other stations. A HEC-RAS (The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) developed the River Analysis System (RAS) to aid hydraulic engineers in channel flow analysis and floodplain determination) simulation demonstrated that the occurrence probability of hurricane Gustav induced rainfall is more than that of 100-year rainfall events and this type of storm rainfall would highly likely occur near the Mountain Island Dam again under the future warming conditions by the conditional prediction of Copula function. Insights gained suggest that it is critical to evaluate the risk of dam failures regarding either extreme weather conditions or potential environmental concerns under the climate change scenarios, especially where human lives are threatened.

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Drought; Extreme events; Climate change; Hydrologic cycle; Hydrometeorology; Flood events	WATER STORAGE; GRAVITY RECOVERY; DROUGHT; GRACE; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; ATLANTIC; EVENTS; RISK	Severe floods and droughts, including their back-to-back occurrences (weather whiplash), have been in-creasing in frequency and severity around the world. Improved understanding of systematic changes in hydrological extremes is essential for preparation and adaptation. In this study, we identified and quantified extreme wet and dry events globally by applying a clustering algorithm to terrestrial water storage (TWS) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (FO). The most intense events, ranked using an intensity metric, often reflect impacts of large-scale oceanic oscillations such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation and consequences of climate change. The severity of both wet and dry events, represented by standardized TWS anomalies, increased significantly in most cases, likely associated with intensification of wet and dry weather regimes in a warmer world, and consequently, exhibited strongest correlation with global temperature. In the Dry climate, the number of wet events decreased while the number of dry events increased significantly, suggesting a drying trend that may be attributed to climate variability and possible increases in irrigation and reliance on groundwater. In the Continental climate where temperature has risen faster than global average, dry events increased significantly. Characteristics of extreme events often showed strong correlations with global temperature, especially when averaged over all climates. These results suggest changes in hydrological extremes and underscore the importance of quantifying total water storage changes when studying hydrological extremes. Extending the GRACE/FO record, which spans 2002 to the present, is essential to continuously tracking changes in TWS and hydrological extremes.

J	Li, BY; Feng, Q; Wang, YC				Li, Boyan; Feng, Qi; Wang, Yunchen			Historical and future runoff changes and their impacts on stormflow characteristics in the upper Yangtze River basin, China	CATENA			English	Article						Runoff change; Climate variability; Anthropogenic activities; SWAT model; The upper Yangtze River	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FLOW REGIME; TRADE-OFFS; UNCERTAINTY; WATER; VARIABILITY; CALIBRATION; STREAMFLOW; SCENARIOS	Identifying the contributions of climate- and human-induced impacts on runoff change have aroused broad attention globally in the hydrological cycles and water resource management. However, a systematic quantitative assessment of the impact of climate changes and human activities on historical and future runoff changes in the upper Yangtze River (UYR) and the effects of runoff variation on stormflow characteristics (e.g., annual runoff distribution) remain unclear. Here, we quantified runoff variations and simulated runoff in the UYR using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model and statistical methods. Our main findings include: (1) climate variability played a dominant role in runoff decline in the UYR from 1972 to 2016 (Slope: -0.10 mm/a, P-value < 0.05), accounting for 43.34 % of the total decrease, while anthropogenic activities accounted for 4.82 %; (2) runoff in the upcoming period of 2020-2059 under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 will increase significantly (P-value < 0.05) at a rate of 0.14 mm, 0.13 mm, and 0.27 mm per year, respectively; (3) water yield and hydrological drought are all projected to decrease in the entire UYR, but flood frequency will increase under the 1.5 degree celsius and 2.0degree celsius global warming. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the status of water resources in the UYR and offers great implications for flood control and effective water resources management over the UYR in the future.

We consider detection and attribution as interrelated study stages within a suggested hypothesis testing framework with the use of a hydrological model. First, we test the significance of the trends in the observed streamflow data series of 74 to 82 years long and evaluate the model's ability to reproduce the trends, so that the trends in the simulated data are statistically indistinguishable from the corresponding observed trends. Herewith, the model is forced by the reanalysis climate data. Then, for the basins where the model reproduces the trends, we move to the attribution stage of the study. At this stage, the hydrological model is forced by the counterfactual (detrended) climate data. If the trend is not detected in the counterfactual-climate-forced simulations, we conclude that the detected observed changes are likely to be attributed to the climate trend. The suggested testing procedure is applied for four river basins: Lena, Selenga, Vyatka, and Pechora. The corresponding hydrological models are developed on the basis of the ECOMAG modeling platform. We conclude that the detected trends in the observed annual flow data series for the Lena, Selenga, and Vyatka rivers, as well as the trends in high flow for the Lena and Selenga rivers, can be attributed to climate drivers with a high confidence. Regional differences in basin mechanisms governing the detected changes are analyzed.

Contrasting epistemic justice against recognition and socio-cultural valuation of ecosystem services, this study explores how flood adaptive green infrastructure planning may recognize and include the local experiential knowledge of underrepresented groups. We focus on Thorncliffe Park, a dense tower neighborhood with a low-income immigrant population in Toronto, Canada, to explore: (1) the local experiential knowledge of residents about floods, climate-adaptive green infrastructure, and structural vulnerabilities; (2) the root causes of epistemic injustice in previous adaptive green infrastructure interventions; (3) siting options for future adaptive green infrastructure. The methodology includes 199 online surveys-among Thorncliffe Park's residents and 20 in-depth interviews with local community leaders and Toronto-based planning experts, policy reviews. Additionally, a spatial component consists of 120 online participatory mapping activities and spatial analysis of surface run-offs. Our findings-reveal that Thorncliffe Park residents are excluded from adaptive green infrastructure planning because flood management-remains a technocratic process-grounded in economic valuation approaches and technical justifications. Our findings-indicate that decision-makers have not credited residents' needs and testimonies over decades due to-historical racial and socio-economic prejudice toward Thorncliffe Park's residents. We also-identify four hermeneutical barriers that prevent residents from impacting decisions, namely a lack of: social networks, citizenship rights, climate awareness opportunities, and communicational tools.

This dramatic event was related to the centennial flood of the Seine River and one of its tributaries, the Loing River, which invaded the lower parts of the mine and eventually weakened the entire structure. To understand the conditions that triggered the disaster and anticipate other catastrophic event of this kind elsewhere, the Royer mine, located in the same area, was chosen to host an underground scientific observatory. Its goal is to study water-rock interactions and in particular water circulation and unusual ground saturation conditions on the behaviour of chalk. The Royer chalk mine is shallow, above the water-table, easily accessible and globally stable. It has been equipped with a high resolution multiparameter monitoring network in 2019; all the sensors are connected to The French National Monitoring Centre for Ground and Underground risks (Cenaris). Besides from in situ observations and monitoring, series of laboratory tests are carried out on samples to study the impact of hydraulic cycles on the short- and long-term behaviours of chalk. A hydromechanical model is also under development to analyse the results and better assess the overall stability of the mine in the context of climate of change. In this paper, we provide a brief summary on the challenges to assess geohazards from abandoned chalk mines, and then present in detail the observatory, its objectives and perspectives, as well as the first results after two years of activity.

Urban water supply system resilience (UWSSR) refers to the ability of a water supply system to maintain its functional stability and adapt to changes. This study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal differences of UWSSR characteristics in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration of China, as well as the contributing factors. Twelve indicators are selected to establish the evaluation framework, and the composite index is calculated using the coefficient of variation method. The spatial agglomeration and distribution characteristics are discussed based on spatial correlation analysis. The results show that (i) UWSSR does not improve significantly with time because it is mainly constrained by the extent of water resources. (ii) UWSSR has a significant spatial correlation for most years, but the spatial agglomeration pattern is not significant. (iii) UWSSR is positively influenced by public services and negatively influenced by public regulation and the level of urbanization during two successive stages. The variables whose regression coefficients changed during these stages are per capita gross domestic product, public financial resources, level of industrialization, public investment in water supply facilities, and public investment in science and technology. This means that the impact of these variables on resilience inverted from promotion to inhibition or from inhibition to promotion. Therefore, this study provides a reliable framework to evaluate the status of UWSSR and its driving factors, which can support effective management practices.

The bias-correction schemes were based on quantile delta mapping (QDM) with different strategies in selecting the data series, including monthly correction (MC), annual correction (AC), peak correction using annual raw data (PCRAW), and annual correction using extreme-index data series (ACEX). Two regional climate model (RCM) outputs from CORDEX-SEA and APHRODITE rainfall datasets were used as modelled and observed data for methodology verification. The study first compared four frequency analysis methods based on generalized extreme value (GEV), Gumbel (GB), Log-Pearson Type III (LP3), and Lognormal (LOGN) distributions, at 9 selected sites over MSEA, and found that LP3 was the best choice for frequency analysis for the study region. Then, the study compared the four bias-correction schemes at both individual sites and all grids over the entire MSEA and indicated that the PCRAW was the best performer in terms of bias-correction for frequency information. Finally, the study gave an ensembled projection of future extreme indices with 200-yr return based on seven CORDEXSEA RCMs and suggested a general increasing trend of all indices over MSEA. The study explored the effect of uncertainty originated from adopting various bias-correction schemes in mapping future frequency of precipitation indices and is valuable in revealing the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation extremes over large areas under climate change which is important for flood/drought risk assessment and adaptation planning.

Geomorphic change in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review							TIDAL RIVER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BENGAL BASIN; SEDIMENT BUDGETS; SEA-LEVEL; PADMA RIVER; QUATERNARY STRATIGRAPHY; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; ARSENIC POLLUTION; FLUVIAL SEDIMENT	The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta is home to more than 170 million people, but is vulnerable to sea level rise, subsidence and direct human disturbance. This Review examines geomorphic change in the delta and its broader impacts. More than 70% of large deltas are under threat from rising sea levels, subsidence and anthropogenic interferences, including the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta, the Earth's largest and most populous delta system. The dynamic geomorphology of this delta is often overlooked in assessments of its vulnerability; consequently, development plans and previous management investments have been undermined by unanticipated geomorphic responses. In this Review, we describe GBM delta dynamics, examining these changes through the Drivers-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses framework. Since the early Holocene, the GBM delta has evolved in response to a combination of tectonics, geology, changing river discharge and sea level rise, but the dynamics observed today are driven by a complex interplay of anthropogenic interferences and natural background processes. Contemporary geomorphic processes such as shoreline change, channel migration, sedimentation and subsidence can increase flooding and erosion, impacting biodiversity, ground and water contamination and local community livelihoods. Continued human disturbances to the GBM delta, such as curtailing sediment supplies, modifying channels and changing land use, could have a more direct influence on the future geomorphic balance of the delta than anthropogenic climate change and sea level rise. In order to contribute to long-term delta sustainability, adaptation responses must therefore be informed by an understanding of geomorphic processes, requiring increased transdisciplinary research on future delta dynamics at centennial timescales and collaboration across all governing bodies and stakeholders.

Analyzing the past changes in the characteristics of compound flood events is critical to understand the changing flood risks associated with the combination of multiple drivers/hazards. Here, we examined the evolution of the compound flood days (defined as days of concurrent extreme precipitation and extreme storm surge exceeding the 90th percentiles) based on the observed precipitation and storm surge data across the globe. Results show that the annual number of compound flood days increased significantly by 1-4 per decade (alpha = 0.1) on the east coast of the US and northern Europe, while the annual number of compound flood days decreased significantly in southern Europe and Japan. The increasing trends in precipitation under extreme storm surge and storm surge under extreme precipitation were found extensively across the world except in Japan, suggesting that more intense precipitation appeared when extreme storm surges occurred, and higher storm surge emerged when extreme precipitation occurred. Comparatively, the global fractional contributions of storm surge (i.e., 65%) on changes in compound flood days were higher than that of precipitation (i.e., 35%), demonstrating that storm surge was more likely to dominate the changes in the number of compound flood days. This study presents the spatial and temporal characteristics of the compound flood events at the global scale, which helps better understanding the compound floods and provides scientific references for flood risk management and an indispensable foundation for further studies.

However, the impacts of loads acting on a building object caused by unlikely phenomena such as: fire, explosion, flood, vehicle impact, plane impact, excessive snowfall, and excess wind gusts are still being ignored when analyzing the structure of building objects in the combinatorics of loads. The paper presents a multi-criteria approach to accidental actions and analyzes design situations and load combinations in relation to accidental actions. The existing legal acts were used to define the concept of a construction disaster. The authors verified, on the basis of applicable legal acts and design guidelines, individual analysis strategies for ensuring the safety of building objects and divided them into consequence classes of structural damage. They collected and analyzed the number of construction disasters which occurred in Poland between 1995-2019 (25 years) based on the data from the General Office of Building Control. The number of disasters was divided by voivodeships and causes and supplemented with the data on the number of people injured. The article presents the direction of research development that could be undertaken in order to eliminate future catastrophes caused by the omission of the analysis of the impact of accidental actions at the design stage. Statistical analyses were carried out to show whether land use, population density, and weather factors (wind) affect the number of recorded disasters. It has been shown that regions that have preserved the sustainable development of their territories are less vulnerable to disasters resulting from extreme weather events.

Design/methodology/approach First, the quality of the historical rainfall data series in 44 years (1975-2018) at Ca Mau station was assessed using the standard normal homogeneity test and the Pettitt test. Second, the appraised rainfall data series are used to establish the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curve for the study area. Findings Based on the findings, a two-year return period, the extreme rainfall intensities (ERIs) ranged from 9.1 mm/h for 8 h rainstorms to 91.2 mm/h for 0.25 h. At a 100-year return period, the ERIs ranged from 18.4 mm/h for 8 h rainstorms to 185.8 mm/h for 0.25 h. The results also show that the narrowest uncertainty level between the lower and upper limits recorded 1.6 mm at 8 h for the two-year return period while the widest range is at 42.5 mm at 0.25 h for the 100-year return period. In general, the possibility of high-intensity rainfall values compared to the extreme rainfall intensities is approximately 2.0% at the 100-year return period. Originality/value The results of the rainfall IDF curves can provide useful information for policymakers to make the right decisions in controlling and minimizing flooding in the study area.

An Integrated Methodology to Study Riparian Vegetation Dynamics: From Field Data to Impact Modeling	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						flow-vegetation interactions</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; impact models</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; model calibration</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; riparian vegetation</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>; stochastic processes</AUTHOR_KEYWORD>	SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; FOREST; BIOMASS; FLOW; ECOLOGY; RIVERS	Riparian environments are highly dynamic ecosystems that support biodiversity and numerous services and that are conditioned by anthropogenic activities and climate change. In this work, we propose an integrated methodology that combines different research approaches-field studies and numerical and analytical modeling-in order to calibrate an ecohydrological stochastic model for riparian vegetation. The model yields vegetation biomass statistics and requires hydrological, topographical, and biological data as input. The biological parameters, namely, the carrying capacity and the flood-related decay rate, are the target of the calibration as they are related to intrinsic features of vegetation and site-specific environmental conditions. The calibration is here performed for two bars located within the riparian zone of the Cinca River (Spain). According to our results, the flood-related decay rate has a spatial dependence that reflects the zonation of different plant species over the study site. The carrying capacity depends on the depth of the phreatic surface, and it is adequately described by a right-skewed curve. The calibrated model well reproduces the actual biogeography of the Cinca riparian zone. The overall percentage absolute difference between the real and the computed biomass amounts to 9.3% and 3.3% for the two bars. The model is further used to predict the future evolution of riparian vegetation in a climate-change scenario. The results show that the change of hydrological regime forecast by future climate projections may induce dramatic reduction of vegetation biomass and strongly modify the Cinca riparian biogeography.

The native anurofauna is rich in species number and endemisms, but has long been regarded as a generalist community originated from neighboring biomes. The accelerated degradation of Cerrado habitats caused by agriculture is bound to affect local anuran communities. This review aims to investigate the effects of anthropogenic activities on local amphibians. Despite a clear paucity, the existing studies indicate that, while this community may be more resilient to some anthropogenic activities (e.g. fire) than their forest counterparts, agricultural environments are strongly dominated by generalist species. Susceptibility to agro-cattle land-uses appears to be determined by specializations, especially regarding habitat and breeding strategies. Natural vegetation fragments are important for maintaining diverse anuran communities in agroecosystems. Agrochemicals cause histopathologic alterations and potential decreased fitness. Chytridiomycosis has been recorded in species extant in the biome, including endemics. The anurofauna appears to be especially sensitive to hydroelectric dams, as even previously common, widespread and generalist species declined or disappeared after dam flooding. Latest predictions indicate the occupation of the Cerrado will proceed northward, which, coupled with climate change, will cause great loss of biodiversity. Only a small portion of suitable natural habitats will remain in northern Cerrado, with amphibian richness being reduced to less than half. We conclude that less popular biomes may benefit from trait-oriented reviews to assess and guide future scientific and conservation projects.	[Ribeiro, Joana; Soares, Amadeu M. V.

The Richelieu River is the last section of the complex Richelieu basin, which is composed of the large Lake Champlain located in a valley between two large mountains. Previous attempts in reproducing the Richelieu River flow relied on the use of simplified lumped models and showed mixed results. In order to prepare a tool to assess accurately the change of flood recurrences in the future, a state-of-the-art distributed hydrological model was applied over the Richelieu basin. The model setup comprises several novel methods and data sets such as a very high resolution river network, a modern calibration technique considering the net basin supply of Lake Champlain, a new optimization algorithm, and the use of an up-to-date meteorological data set to force the model. The results show that the hydrological model is able to satisfactorily reproduce the multiyear mean annual hydrograph and the 2011 flow time series when compared with the observed river flow and an estimation of the Lake Champlain net basin supply. Many factors, such as the quality of the meteorological forcing data, that are affected by the low density of the station network, the steep terrain, and the lake storage effect challenged the simulation of the river flow. Overall, the satisfactory validation of the hydrological model allows to move to the next step, which consists in assessing the impacts of climate change on the recurrence of Richelieu River floods.

We adapted the Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (TM) (PIRS (TM)) methodology, originally developed for flood hazards, to heat and piloted it in five geographically diverse U.S. cities. We used PIRS (TM) for Heat to analyze how policies across community plans would affect urban heat and compared spatial patterns in policy attention with indicators of vulnerability. We find that heat mitigation policies are not targeting the highest heat risk areas.

Owing to the disaster risk management, there is a need to determine the Dead Fuel Index (DFI) threshold of the fire occurrence area and analyze the spatio-temporal variation of DFI to apply prevention measures efficiently and facilitate sustainable fire risk management. This study used the MODIS Burned Area Monthly L3 (MCD64A1), Landsat Global Burned Area (BA) products, and MODIS Surface Reflectance 8-Day L3 (MOD09A1) data from 2001 to 2020 to calculate the values of the DFI in the study area before the occurrence of fire. The results showed that: (1) The inversion of the meadow steppe DFI values in the fire area was distributed in the range of 14-26, and the fire rate was the highest in the range of 20-22. The inversion of the typical steppe DFI values in the fire area was distributed in the range of 12-26, and the fire rate was the highest in the range of 16-22. (2) Areas with high fire DFI values included Khalkhgol, Matad, Erdenetsagaan, Bayandun, Gurvanzagal, Dashbalbar in Mongolia, and scattered areas of the Greater Khingan Mountains (forest edge meadow steppe area), East and West Ujumqin Banner, and Xin Barag Right Banner. The highest fire probability of fire occurred during October and April. (3) The DFI values were sensitive to changes in altitude. The results of this study may provide useful information on surface energy balance, grassland carbon storage, soil moisture, grassland health, land desertification, and grazing in the study area, especially for fire risk management.

Here, we present Rb/Sr data for the past 300 years for sediments collected from Chaonaqiu Lake in the Liupan Mountains of the western Chinese Loess Plateau as a decadal-scale record of weathering intensity. To validate the application of this weathering proxy, we correlated the record with those of other major elements, rock-forming minerals, and paleoclimatic proxies. We found that Rb/Sr ratios are influenced mainly by Sr activity within the lake catchment (where Sr is likely sourced from albite). In addition, higher (lower) Rb/Sr ratios of bulk sediments from Chaonaqiu Lake are correlated with lower (higher) fractions of terrigenous detritus (SiO2, Ti, K2O, Al2O3, and Na2O). These indicate that the Rb/Sr ratios of bulk sediments in Chaonaqiu Lake are closely linked to terrigenous detritus input on decadal scales and also correlate well with TOC (a precipitation indicator) and other high-resolution paleoclimate records (e.g., tree rings and drought/flood index) in neighboring regions, with higher (lower) Rb/Sr ratios corresponding to more (less) precipitation. Lake bulk sediment Rb/Sr ratios are dominated by the input of terrigenous detritus over decadal timescales. Our data show that physical and chemical weathering in the Chaonaqiu Lake watershed have opposing influences on Rb/Sr ratios of bulk sediment, competing to dominate these ratios of lake sediments over different timescales, with ratios reflecting the relative importance of the two types of weathering.

The dynamics of a plant population are influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors that interfere with the phenotype of the individual, indicating how species develop in the occupied environment. Riparian plant species are subject to environmental fluctuations, such as periodic flooding regimes and severe droughts, which may result from climate change. Aims. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological growth responses of individuals of Inga vera subsp. affinis (DC.) T.D.Penn. in controlled drought and flooding conditions by observing variations in functional traits using controlled experiments. Methods. Individuals were subjected to partial flooding and dry periods, and functional traits, such as leaf area, root height and dry mass, were analysed. The difference between treatments was tested using unifactorial statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Key results. Fifteen-day-old individuals of Inga vera subsp. affinis kept under flooding conditions showed lower root height and dry mass compared to plants exposed to drought treatment; 50-day-old plants under flooding conditions also presented lower root dry mass than did plants in drought treatment, maintaining the result after the resilience period.Conclusions Root dry mass was the most affected variable in individuals of Inga vera subsp. affinis under flooding conditions, even after the recovery period. In general, plants in the control and drought treatments did not differ significantly considering the analysed variables. Implications. Given the current climate change conditions, an increase in the frequency and duration of extreme events, such as floods and droughts, is expected. Thus, understanding how phenotypical traits of species already adapted to flooding conditions behave under water stress and waterlogged conditions for longer periods of time is essential to explain plant responses and predict future survival scenarios for the species.

The PSIDS have a high ranking in the Climate Risk Index and the World Risk Index. Financial losses due to climate-induced disasters, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), are also high in the Pacific region. While climate risk insurance solutions could play a key role in the efficient distribution of recovery resources, there are many challenges to their successful implementation. Effective climate risk insurance products for the vulnerable sections of these societies are almost non-existent in this part of the world. Among the worst climate-induced disasters to affect the PSIDS are those related to cyclones and floods. These not only adversely impact the welfare of the households affected by these disasters, but they lower the long-term development potential of the countries involved. There is also evidence to suggest that climate-induced disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity over time due to climate change. It is against this background that an inquiry into the necessity for climate risk insurance products in the context of PSIDS should take place. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the literature addressing climate risk insurance as a risk mitigation or climate adaptation tool for managing the climate-induced financial vulnerabilities in the PSIDS. The paper explores the affordability of climate risk insurance, particularly among the vulnerable sections of society, and discusses the challenges of implementing an appropriate climate risk insurance model in the region. Finally, it examines recent climate risk insurance initiatives that have been attempted by multilateral agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations' Pacific Financial Inclusion Practice (UNCDF), Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme (PICAP), and respective local governments.

These lakes are known to destabilize the glaciers by enhancing their frontal ablation, causing higher than average glacier area and mass losses. Thus, to comprehend the dynamics of proglacial lakes and their influence on the overall glacier health, we study the lake-terminating Dulung Glacier located in the Suru sub-basin, Ladakh, western Himalaya and compare it with the adjacent land-terminating Chilung Glacier. The pronounced melting of the Dulung Glacier, supported by glacier topography (surface gradient between accumulation and ablation zone) and valley morphology (wider near the snout and narrower downwards), seems to be the prime reason for the formation, accommodation and sustenance of the proglacial lake. The expansion in proglacial lake (.008 km(2)a(-1)) during 1977-2018 is accompanied by an enhanced degeneration of the Dulung Glacier (mass balance: -.47 +/- .06 m w.e.a(-1), shrinkage rate: .3 +/- .001% a(-1); retreat rate: 32 +/- .7 ma(-1), surface ice velocity reduction: 16%), which has accelerated post-1993. In comparison, land-terminating Chilung Glacier shows lower degeneration rates (mass balance: -.28 +/- .02 m w.e.a(-1); shrinkage rate: .2 +/- .001% a(-1); retreat rate: 17 +/- 0.7 ma(-1), surface ice velocity reduction: 8%) during 1971-2018. This suggests a substantial impact of the proglacial lake in enhancing the Dulung Glacier's sensitivity towards climate change compared to the Chilung Glacier. If the current rate of lake expansion continues, it would further enhance the Dulung Glaciers' degeneration rates, thus impacting its stability.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has one of the fastgrowing populations with more than half of the global growth between now and 2050. The challenge now lies in feeding the ever-growing population that is exerting pressure on the limited available resources. Doubling the agricultural productivity of small-scale farmers by 2030 (SDG 2.3) remains a daunting task for researcher and policy makers to address on the continent that now relies much on imports of food. Exploitation of the untapped massive land resources for agricultural production poses threats to sustainability. However, the challenges of global warming cannot be left out of this discussion since it has direct impact on future productivity on the continent. Climate change that has been projected to mostly affect the poorer countries also present trials to the food system through increased diseases and weather extremes of floods and droughts. Questions are yet to be answered on which tradeoffs and synergies if any need to be made to achieve zero hunger in Africa by 2030. This synopsis critically breaks down the conflicts, tradeoffs and synergies of how a continent with such massive agricultural production potential can navigate sustainably to achieve zero hunger, self-sufficiency and exports prospects while conserving the environment and natural resources. Evident deployment of new and improved technologies especially advanced biotechnology tools will be critical in achieving zero hunger by 2030. The adaptation needs of the continent are broad including institutional, social, physical and infrastructural needs, ecosystem services and environmental needs, and financial and capacity uncertain impacts.

J	Ameel, L				Ameel, Lieven			The Destruction of Amsterdam Flood Allegories in Contemporary Dutch Literature	TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR NEDERLANDSE TAAL-EN LETTERKUNDE			English	Article								This article examines representations of urban destruction and of rising waters in Pieter Boskma's Tsunami in de Amstel (2016) and in Guido van Driel's De ondergang van Amsterdam (2007). It foregrounds the ways in which these texts reflect productively on visualisations and narrative frames of catastrophe, and how they propose alternative temporalities (in the case of Boskma) and alternative visual perspectives (in van Driel) for imagining possible urban end times. At the background of this article is an increased tendency in ecocritical approaches to read representations of destructive climate change (in prose literature, in particular) in terms of their implications for understanding real-world radical climatological and environmental change. Such perspectives are complemented here with an examination of allegorical readings of flood in a poetry collection and graphic novel.

J	Fan, LL; Du, L				Fan, Linlin; Du, Ling			Combined effects of climatic factors on extreme sea level changes in the Northwest Pacific Ocean	OCEAN DYNAMICS			English	Article						ESLs; Climate change; Partial correlation-joint return period; Coastal flooding risk	WATER LEVELS; STORM-SURGE; RISE; TIDE; REANALYSIS	Extreme sea level events (ESLs) act as a comprehensive consequence of climate change, and a better understanding of the impact processes of climatic factors on ESLs variability is essential for obtaining a coastal sustainable development strategy. In this work, hourly sea-level data from 699 worldwide tide gauges between 1960 and 2013 were used to analyze the ESLs variability, and we selected 72 representative tide gauges in the Northwest Pacific, which stood out in terms of ESLs intensity, duration and occurrence. Under the climate change framework, The Northwest Pacific is a key area that subjected to stronger, longer, and more frequent ESLs after 1990, and reef coast ESLs gradually shifted their sensitivity from intensity to occurrence. TC-summer and winter are the peak seasons of ESLs during the year. The effects of water level discrepancy (WLD) on ESLs are increasing, and the growing impacts even exceeded the impact of sea-level at a few Indonesian tide gauges. Low frequency variations of sea-level are provided as the background of ESLs variabilities on a seasonal time scale and secular change, with more than 80% of tide gauges experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. In terms of magnitude, the high tide level is the major climatic factor to ESLs along the Northwest Pacific coast. The nested Gumbel-Hougaard copula function is built to evaluate the ESLs partial correlation-joint return period, which introduces the combined effect of WLD, sea-level variability, high tide level, and wind. Sea-level variability, WLD, and wind all shorten the ESLs joint return periods at more than 70% tide gauges, particularly, wind exhibits as a significant shortening climatic factor throughout the Northwest Pacific. Meanwhile, the high tide level shows significant and complicated contribution to the ESLs, which fluctuated according to the complex features of the tidal wave system, and this complexity makes it possible to increase the return period. An individual climatic factor influenced weakly on ESLs joint return period when a second climatic factor is introduced considering the interactions between different climatic factors. More tide gauges will likely exhibit complex features of the ESLs joint return period, and some tide gauges that have a shortened ESLs joint return period may even show an increase. Considering the coastal flooding risk framework, coastal flooding risk is growing in the decadal fluctuation, so the enhanced forecasting and prevention strategy against future ESLs will provide an effective blueprint for adaption and mitigation.

Community resilience is a relatively recent approach to resilience, increasingly used in the natural hazards and climate change literature. This study aims to assess the community resilience of a flood-prone district, the Saadi neighborhood, in Shiraz, Iran. Based on an extensive literature review, an indicator-based framework was outlined to measure community resilience to flash floods using five dimensions: social, community capital, economic, institutional, and infrastructural and housing resilience. The primary data on community flood resilience assessment was collected through a survey using questionnaires. Using simple random sampling, 374 individuals from the residents of the study area were selected. The data were ranked and analyzed through qualification methods, descriptive statistics and expert panel weighting system. The overall composite community resilience and the community resilience indices' scores were .56 out of 1 for the selected community, indicating a moderate level of resilience. The findings showed that institutional and infrastructure/housing conditions had a limited impact on community resilience. However, social trust and community capital were crucial for aiding the community's rapid recovery from a flood disaster and preparing for future floods. Policymakers and resilience planners, thus, should focus on the lessons that can be learnt from the past floods, particularly in terms of infrastructure and institutional resilience, as these have a significant impact on the overall resilience of local communities.

J	Norizan, NZA; Hassan, N; Yusoff, MM				Norizan, Nur Zainul Arifin; Hassan, Norhaslina; Yusoff, Mariney Mohd			Strengthening flood resilient development in malaysia through integration of flood risk reduction measures in local plans	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Resilience; Disaster risk reduction; Flood risk reduction; Urban planning; Local plan	ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; CITIES	The increasing flood hazards due to climate change and development pressures have called for the integration of disaster resilient attributes through holistic flood risk reduction measures in development plans. Strengthening flood resilience in development planning therefore is not only to prevent risk, but also to reduce vulnerability as well as inculcate preparedness to adapt and better respond to disaster. In Malaysia, the notion of disaster resilience has become a recent development agenda in response to disaster risks especially flooding since the country is highly prone to such hazard. Flood reduction measures have become the key elements in Malaysia's development plans at all levels, but little is known about the range of such measures being integrated in local development plan, which is a statutory development plan that guides planning control decisions and enable local communities to participate in local development agenda. Therefore, this study seeks to analyse the extent to which flood risk reduction measures are being integrated into local plans in Malaysia towards flood resiliency. The study, however, is limited to qualitative approach based on literature and content analysis of selected local plans. The finding suggests that all studied plans have integrated most measures to avoid risk and reduce vulnerability although measures on disaster preparedness were inadequate. There is a need thus, to further strengthen disaster resilience measures in the local development plans to ingrain preparedness and adaptation with more inclusive participatory civil societies and stakeholders.

Streamflows are directly influenced by these forces, however, their cumulative effects over time arc considered as indirect effects. This study investigated the distinct effects of precipitation, temperature, and htunan activities on hydrological droughts in five major river basins in South Korea. Change points in the hydrological data were identified after the 1990s in all basins by the sequential Mann-Kendall test. We used two water balance models, the ABCD and the GR2M, in this study, and their integration was used for streamflow simulations. We applied the standardized runoff index (SRI) to identify hydrological drought under different data-driven scenarios (climate change, constant temperature with varying precipitation, constant precipitation with varying temperature, and human influence). Natural and anthropogenic variations had a greater effect on drought severity than on drought duration. Variation in precipitation increased streamflow by 12.42%, followed by human activity at 0.71%; temperature decreased streamflow by -0.7% on average. Precipitation was a dominant factor that increased drought severity by 4138%, followed by human activity at 15.85%; temperature decreased drought severity by -0.86% on average. This study improves understanding of the response of streamflow and hydrological drought to precipitation, temperature, and human activities, which is beneficial for decision makers and water managers in developing adaptive strategies to alleviate extreme natural disasters.

The lower NSR region is particularly valuable as it is inhabited by approximately 6.7 million people. The basin has limited hydraulic conservancy infrastructure and insufficient ability to cope with climate change risks. Studying the hydrological characteristics and changes in the basin provides the scientific basis for rational protection and development of the basin. However, owing to the limitation of observation data, previous studies have focused on the local area and neglected the study of the lower reaches, which is not enough to reflect the spatial characteristics of the entire basin. In this study, the ECMWF 5th generation reanalysis data (ERA5) and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) were applied to develop a geomorphology-based hydrological model (GBHM) for reconstructing hydrological datasets (i.e. GBHM-ERA5 and GBHM-MSWEP). The reconstructed datasets covering the complete basin were verified against the gauge observation and compared with other commonly used streamflow products, including Global Flood Awareness System v2.1, GloFAS-Reanalysis dataset v3.0, and linear optimal runoff aggregate (LORA). The comparison results revealed that GBHM-ERA5 is significantly better than the other four datasets and provides a good reproduction of the hydrological characteristics and trends of the NSR. Detailed analysis of GBHM-ERA5 revealed that: (1) A multi-year mean surface runoff represented 39% of precipitation over the basin during 1980-2018, which had low surface runoff in the upstream, while areas around the Three Parallel Rivers Area and the estuary had abundant surface runoff. (2) The surface runoff and discharge coefficient of variations in spring were larger than those in other seasons, and the inter-annual variation in the downstream was smaller than that in the upstream and midstream regions. (3) More than 70% of the basin areas showed a decreasing trend in the surface runoff, except for parts of Nagqu, south of Shan State in Myanmar, and Thailand, where surface runoff has an increasing trend. (4) The downstream discharge has dropped significantly at a rate of approximately 680 million cubic metres per year, and the decline rate is greater than that of upstream and midstream, especially in summer. This study provides a data basis for subsequent studies in the NSR basin and further elucidates the impact of climate change on the basin, which is beneficial to river planning and promotes international cooperation on the water- and eco-security of the basin.

Specifically, this paper presents a methodology to prob-abilistically estimate regional hurricane loss considering both hurricane intensity and size as well as projected sea surface temperature change as a function of climate change. It is most common to characterize the hurricane wind hazard using a measure of intensity only. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for storm size when characterizing the hurricane hazard in order to properly estimate/predict the spatial extent of damage. For purposes of regional loss estimation, therefore, considering maximum wind speed only may not be adequate. A storm with larger size but lower intensity might result in more damage and hence greater total loss than a smaller, more intense storm. Here, the maximum wind speed (intensity) and the radius of maximum winds (spatial extent) are selected as the two dominant indicators (parameters) characterizing the hurricane (event) hazard. The resulting bivariate hazard model is then used as input to a regional loss estimation model to illustrate its potential application. Only hurricane wind damage (and associated losses from both wind damage and water intrusion) is considered in this study. Collateral damage due to flood or storm surge is not addressed here. Simulated events impacting this region are extracted from a synthetic hurricane database (developed by the author and his colleagues) and the joint distribution of intensity and size is established to characterize the hurricane hazard. Regional loss for each simulated hurricane event is then estimated using the loss estimation module in HAZUS_MH. Finally, distributions of regional loss at different (event) hazard levels are generated. A future climate scenario (increasing sea surface temperature) is next considered and the joint distribution of hurricane intensity and size and the resulting loss distribution curve is recomputed. The results are then able to be compared to those under the current climate scenario. Such comparisons can help to inform codes and standards committees, for example, as they consider whether and how to take potential climate change impacts (in the design lifetime) into account. They also can inform ongoing public discourse around mitigation and adaptation, whether hardening of buildings and other infrastructure systems, community resilience planning, construction practices, or related policies.

J	Fanaian, S; Fanaian, F				Fanaian, Safa; Fanaian, Farnoosh			A tug of war between centralization and decentralization: the co-evolution of urban governance and water risks in Guwahati, India	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						global South; intermediate city; historical institutionalism; multi-level perspective theory	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM; MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE; TRANSITIONS; CITY; RIVER; SUSTAINABILITY; EVOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS	Intermediate cities in Asia and Africa house more than 60% of the world's urban population. More than 54% of the people here face high levels of water stress and are increasingly vulnerable to water-related risks such as floods, limited access to safe drinking water and water pollution. These urban water risks are complex outcomes of climate change, land use changes, governance failures, and social inequities. This study examines the co-evolution of three water risks and governance responses through the case of Guwahati, India. Guwahati, on the Brahmaputra River in the Northeast of India, serves as a case of an intermediate city to demonstrate changes in water risk governance trends. We focus on studying the connected governance responses to changes in three interrelated water risks, i.e., domestic water supply, urban floods, and river pollution. The shifts in the socio-political structures for these risks are assessed by combining historical institutionalism with multi-level perspective theory. The results show that despite the growing diversity of actors and devolution of responsibilities in cities to mitigate water risks, there is an ongoing tug-of-war between centralized and decentralized modes of decision-making. Contrary to the recommendations for decentralized urban governance, the trend is currently tugging towards a centralized decision-making mode. However, when differences arise between the local and national, local actors within their limited frames of action manage to circumnavigate nationally dictated mandates to fit local needs.

BP. Numerous subfossil palaeomeanders of different sizes have been discovered in the valley floor. Here, we present the first results of multiproxy research on the paleo-oxbow lake fill, one of the oldest in the region. The wide range of palaeoecological analyses resulted in reconstructions of vegetation history, climatic, hydrological and habitat changes. The studied oxbow was an aquatic ecosystem with diverse invertebrate fauna until the end of Younger Dryas when it transformed into a limno-telmatic habitat. The sediment composition indicates active denudation processes and several episodes of turbulent hydrological conditions. Such an increased river activity could have caused flooding, resulting in an allochthonous matter supply to the oxbow lake in Late Vistulian. Environmental changes were strictly related to the regional features of the catchment, the transformation of soils, and the hydrogeological conditions. The chironomid-and pollen-inferred climatic reconstructions indicate periods of high and low continentality. The chironomid record indicates relatively cool summer conditions in the Allerod, especially ca. 13,000 cal. BP, possibly related to the Gerzensee Oscillation. On the other hand, a distinct increase of summer temperatures in Younger Dryas (up to 16 degrees C) was recorded. Such a situation was also confirmed in some other studies from the region, suggesting that it might be the effect of some specific, local palaeoclimatic conditions.

Taphonomy and depositional history of the Southfork Quarry (Cypress Hills Formation, late Eocene) in southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Paleogene; fluvial; Western Canada; Chadronian; Megacerops coloradensis	MOUNTAIN FORMATION; MIDDLE MIOCENE; FAUNA; OLIGOCENE; RIVER; BONE; COMPONENT; MAMMALS; EXAMPLE; CYCLES	The Eocene to Miocene Cypress Hills Formation (CHF) spans 28 million years and forms the conglomeratic caprock of the Cypress Hills and Swift Current plateaus in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta. These stacked fluvial, flood plain, and lacustrine deposits preserve the only high latitude, non-polar mammalian fossil assemblage (Uintan to Hemingfordian land mammal stages) in Canada. The Quarry is the oldest CHF (Chadronian 1, late Eocene) site documented in the Cypress Hills region north of the town of Eastend. The Quarry was originally discovered in 1962, after bones were found to be eroding out of the base of a road cut north of the ghost town of South Fork on the southeastern flanks of the Cypress Hills. Numerous field campaigns have resulted in the collection of fossils from a multitaxonomic bonebed. This paper presents a detailed sedimentologic, paleontologic, and taphonomic study to establish a depositional environment framework of the Southfork Quarry. This site was deposited at the onset of the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition, a critical time of climate change during the Paleogene. Six facies and two facies associations are characterized for the Quarry, shifting from a braided-fluvial system to a debris flow-filled incised channel. Patterns of skeletal accumulations and bone surface modification indicate that the assemblage accumulated over a significant interval of time in different depositional environments. This study provides critical insight into environmental shifts driven by climate change and relates these findings to a broader understanding of the Eocene-Oligocene transition in North America.

As a result, assessing and mapping the potential risks of flood on maps become crucial to mitigate risks and enhance adaptation plans. This research paper ponders a systematic methodological approach by considering quantitative data obtained from secondary sources to generate maps of flood-induced risks and vulnerability in the Barguna district. The specific method contemplates four major steps as: (i) used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to generate comprehensive weights of hazard exposure and vulnerability; (ii) prepared a hazard exposure map using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach; (iii) deployed the indexing method to calculate the vulnerability indices for the study area; and (iv) generated the comprehensive flood risk maps by integrating AHP results, MCDM outcomes, and vulnerability indices upon employing geographic information systems (GIS). The status of the flood risk of the study area are identified and quantified as very high (168 sq. km, 12.91%), high (321 sq. km, 24.74%), moderate (368 sq. km, 28.37%), low (316 sq. km, 24.37%), and very low (125 sq. km, 9.61%). Also, results demonstrate that the southern and northeastern parts of the study area are likely to be categorized as higher risk of potential flooding. Furthermore, a flood risk zonation map is prepared to better explain the underlying dynamics of the associated risk components in different regions. Note that, the results of this study are critical for policymakers to complement development strategies by reducing flood related risks while engaging multiple stakeholders.

Mapping susceptible areas of a watershed is a key measure to develop an assessment of restoration strategies to protect people from flooding, but it is difficult to pinpoint the best place to start. Studies about flooding in urban areas and priority areas for restoration have been conducted separately; however, the interface between these themes has been less explored. Therefore, this paper presents two methods to develop flood susceptibility maps, as well as priority restoration areas: Areas of Variable Inflow (AVI) and the most Hydrologically Sensitive Areas (HSA+). The AVI calculation was developed using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). The HSA + calculation was based on criteria that are among the most used in flood studies, combined using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). All AVI and HSA+ within Riparian Preservation Areas (RPA) and without vegetation cover were considered priority areas for restoration. AVI occupied 16.6759 km(2) (18.63%), with 2.1172 km(2) as a priority (3.76% of the RPA). HSA + included 12.4863 km(2) (13.95%), with 3.3603 km(2) as a priority (5.97% of the RPA). Most AVI and HSA+ were located outside the RPA, which indicates the necessity for additional conservation on the watershed, even though restoration within RPA must be the priority. Both methods may be applied in any watershed, but we indicate that HSA + provides better results since it considers a wider range of criteria. Since flooding events are rising due to climate change, prioritizing restoration efforts becomes indispensable.

J	Zhou, WY; Leung, LR; Lu, J				Zhou, Wenyu; Leung, L. Ruby; Lu, Jian			Seasonally Dependent Future Changes in the US Midwest Hydroclimate and Extremes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Atmospheric circulation; Extreme events; Climate change; Ensembles	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; INTENSIFICATION; SIMULATIONS; CIRCULATION; PROJECTIONS; JET	This study investigates the responses of the hydroclimate and extremes in the U.S. Midwest to global warming, based on ensemble projections of phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and the multimodel initial-condition large-ensemble simulations. The precipitation response features a seasonally dependent change with increased precipitation in April-May but reduced precipitation in July-August. The late-spring wetting is attributed to the enhanced low-level moisture-transporting southerlies, which are induced by regional sea level pressure anomalies linked to the poleward shift of the North American westerly jet (NAWJ). The late-summer drying is attributed to the weakened storm track, which is also linked to the poleward NAWJ shift. The seasonally dependent future changes of the Midwest precipitation are analogous to its climatological seasonal progression, which increases over late spring as the NAWJ approaches the Midwest and decreases over late summer as the NAWJ migrates away. In response to the mean precipitation changes, extremely wet late springs (April-May precipitation above the 99th percentile of the historical period) and extremely dry late summers (below the 1st percentile) will occur much more frequently, implying increased late-spring floods and late-summer droughts. Future warming in the Midwest is amplified in late summer due to the reduced precipitation. With amplified background warming and increased occurrence, future late-summer droughts will be more devastating. Our results highlight that, under a time-invariant poleward jet shift, opposite precipitation changes arise before and after the peak rainy month, leading to substantial increases in the subseasonal extremes. The severity of such climate impacts is obscured in projections of the rainy-season mean.	[Zhou, Wenyu; Leung, L.

In this study, we analysed the effects of climate variability on the temporal and spatial variations in population dynamics of the green crab Carcinus maenas in the Mondego estuary (Portugal), between 2003 and 2018. In this 15-year period, a greater recruitment of C. maenas was observed during drought periods, periods which was matched by an increase in secondary production. Ontogenic stage segregation was also observed, with juveniles being found mainly in the further upriver areas of the estuary. The estuarine population was mainly composed of the green morphotype, with the orange and red morphotypes present in more downstream areas of the estuary. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed high spatial and temporal variability of C. maenas in the estuary which was related with environmental changes over the 15-year period. A correlation between C. maenas biological features and several local-scale (salinity and river runoff) and large-scale (North Atlantic Oscillation index and Eastern Atlantic pattern) environmental variables was identified through cumulative sums analysis (CUSUM), indicating a strong environmental control on C. maenas population dynamics. This paper shows the importance of relatively long-term datasets to unravel the effects of extreme weather events due to climate change on key epibenthic estuarine species, and also how they might cope with a changing marine environment.

Global costs of protecting against sea-level rise at 1.5 to 4.0 °C	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Adaptation; Dike; Cost; Damage	ANTARCTIC ICE-SHEET; CLIMATE-CHANGE; 2.0-DEGREES-C RISE; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; SCENARIOS; MODEL; 1.5-DEGREES-C; TEMPERATURES; ADAPTATION	Sea levels will rise, even with stringent climate change mitigation. Mitigation will slow the rate of rise. There is limited knowledge on how the costs of coastal protection vary with alternative global warming levels of 1.5 to 4.0 degrees C. Analysing six sea-level rise scenarios (0.74 to 1.09 m, 50th percentile) across these warming levels, and five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, this paper quantifies the economic costs of flooding and protection due to sea-level rise using the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modelling framework. Results are presented for World Bank income groups and five selected countries from the present to 2100. Annual sea flood damage costs without additional adaptation are more influenced by socio-economic development than sea-level rise, indicating that there are opportunities to control risk with development choices. In contrast, annual sea dike investment costs are more dependent on the magnitude of sea-level rise. In terms of total costs with adaptation, upper middle, low middle and low income groups are projected to have higher relative costs as a proportion of GDP compared with high income groups. If low income countries protected now, flood costs could be reduced after 2050 and beyond. However, without further adaptation, their coasts will experience growing risks and costs leaving them increasingly reliant on emergency response measures. Without mitigation or adaptation, greater inequalities in damage costs between income groups could result. At country level, annual sea flood damage costs without additional adaptation are projected to rapidly increase with approximately 0.2 m of sea-level rise, leaving limited time to plan and adapt.

In southern Asia, fascioliasis is a problem in livestock from the Near East to Bangladesh, where recent human infection reports are worrying. In this region, Fasciola gigantica is transmitted by species of the Radix auricularia superspecies group. In the densely populated northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, livestock appears infected throughout. The economic importance of buffaloes highlights the need to control their very high infection rates. Methods In the Gorakhpur area, a molecular method based on the two specific primer sets of genomic DNA was applied to fasciolids from buffaloes slaughtered in local abattoirs and cercariae from R. acuminata snails from freshwater collections. Results PCR products and sequences demonstrated that the cercariae belonged to F. gigantica and that R. acuminata acts as vector for its transmission to buffaloes. The 72.0% rate found in one transmission focus appears to be the highest worldwide record of fasciolid infection in a lymnaeid population. Lymnaeid prevalences and burdens found close to human communities indicate a very high infection risk. Conclusion This method is simple, fast and cheap because there is no need for sequencing, it differentiates between fasciolid species and between fasciolids and other trematodes infecting R. acuminata, facilitates epidemiological surveys, and is useful for surveillance to evaluate the efficiency of control measures. Within climate change predictions, future increases of rain events and floods suggest the need for control and surveillance efforts in this endemic area.

However, most of the knowledge on BGI is produced in the global North, overlooking the diversity of urban contexts globally. Here, we review the literature on BGI for flood risk mitigation and water quality improvement in Southeast Asian cities to understand the scope of practical knowledge and identify research needs. We searched for evidence of local types of BGI in peer-reviewed and grey literature and assessed the performance of BGI based on hydrological, societal, and environmental metrics. The body of literature on BGI in Southeast Asia is small and dominated by wealthier countries but we found evidence of uptake among researchers and practitioners in most countries. Bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, and green cover received the most attention in research. Evidence from modelling and laboratory studies confirmed the potential for BGI to address flooding and water quality issues in the region. However, practical knowledge to mainstream the implementation of BGI remains limited, with insufficient primary hydrological data and information on societal and environmental impacts. In addition, the performance of BGI in combination with grey infrastructure, under climate change, or in informal settlements is poorly studied. Future research and practice should focus on producing and sharing empirical data, ultimately increasing the regional knowledge base to promote efficient BGI strategies.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flooding; Fluctuation frequency; Coastal wetland; Phenotypic plasticity; Intraspecific differentiation	FLOODING STRESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES; BIOMASS; SUBMERGENCE; MACROPHYTES; SALINITY	Greater differences in hydrologic conditions are expected between coastal and inland wetlands with global climate change. Local adaptation has been considered as a significant driver of intraspecific differentiation in heterogeneous habitats. The common reed Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan wetland species with high genetic variability and adaptability. In our study, reeds collected from coastal and inland wetlands were subjected to three stable water level gradients and two fluctuation frequencies in a common garden experiment. We measured their aboveground and belowground biomass, height, density, stem diameter, leaf water potential, specific leaf area, and photosynthetic parameters. Our results showed that P. australis exhibited high tolerance to stable and fluctuating water levels up to 30 cm depth. Increased shoot elongation rate and water-use efficiency promoted the establishment of P. australis in flooding habitats. The common reeds in the high-frequency water level fluctuation had a shorter shoot height and a lower shoot density than those in the low-frequency one. The coastal populations performed better under high (30 cm) and low (0 cm) water levels than the inland populations, which preferred shallow water (15 cm). The adaptation strategies of coastal and inland reeds to fluctuation frequencies were no different. We concluded that local adaptation might occur in P. australis populations due to different water levels rather than fluctuation frequency in coastal and inland wetlands. Our findings could provide a theoretical basis on the effects of flooding on intraspecific variation of wetland plants in future environmental change scene. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

These risk, discourses, and practices occur at multiple scales that are embedded within one another and draw their significance from cross-scalar connections; from global estimates of ocean density and emission scenarios, local design criteria for flood management, networks of tidal gauges, and individual and collective experiences of loss and change. Thus social actors responding to the complex physical challenges posed by climate change across space and time must deal with an inherent politics of building shared understanding and agreeing on (or not) desirable courses of action. These dynamics produce 'scalar politics,' i.e. strategies for defining and managing perceived risks at specific scales, resulting in more or less equitable and effective responses to the uneven consequences of SLR. To highlight the scalar politics of knowledge systems in adaptation planning, we present findings from two case studies of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Florida, USA. Drawing on our findings, we propose the concept 'scalar knowledge politics of risk.' As knowledge claims flow between global, regional, and local decision-making spaces, we identify five scales at which knowledge systems experience friction: 1) construction of the global climate; 2) regional downscaling of climate impacts; 3) local definition of risks; 4) transformation of on-the-ground social-ecological-technical systems and infrastructures; and, 5) evaluation of interventions. Through our case study investigation of the scalar politics of SLR adaptation, we hope to help illuminate and inform strategies to overcome long-standing barriers to effective and inclusive urban adaptation.

The palynological analysis of the paleocommunities shows, in a first stage of the mid Holocene, the predominance of marsh grasslands and hygrophilous communities that indicates humid to sub-humid environmental conditions. In a later stage of the mid Holocene, the paleocommunities show a characteristic association of wetlands, which together with the presence of Typha sp., would indicate sub-humid to humid conditions and waterlogged or flooded soils with slow-moving water. For the late Holocene, the paleocommunities show, initially, the presence of a grass-dominated herbaceous steppe, indicating environmental disturbances, which in the fossil record could reflect the combination of intense wind action under a dry climate. In a later stage, the frequency and variety of species characteristic of humid environments increase, dominated by marshy-herbaceous species, in addition to the development of the hygrophilous forest. Consequently, since the mid Holocene, the main climate factors responsible for the observed changes in wetland conditions were the location and intensity of the Atlantic and Pacific anticyclones in addition to changes in sea level. These forces mainly affected the distribution of precipitation, causing significant changes in the vegetation communities.

Coastal groundwater will rise with sea level, affecting water quality, the structural integrity of infrastructure, and natural ecosystem health. SLR-induced groundwater rise has been studied in coastal areas of high aquifer transmissivity. In this regional study, SLR-induced groundwater rise is investigated in a coastal area characterized by shallow unconsolidated deposits overlying fractured bedrock, typical of the glaciated NE. A numerical groundwater-flow model is used with groundwater observations and withdrawals, LIDAR topography, and surface-water hydrology to investigate SLR-induced changes in groundwater levels in New Hampshire's coastal region. The SLR groundwater signal is detected more than three times farther inland than projected tidal flooding from SLR. The projected mean groundwater rise relative to SLR is 66% between 0 and 1 km, 34% between 1 and 2 km, 18% between 2 and 3 km, 7% between 3 and 4 km, and 3% between 4 and 5 km of the coastline, with large variability around the mean. The largest magnitude of SLR-induced groundwater rise occurs in the marine and estuarine deposits and peninsulas with tidal water bodies on three sides. Groundwater rise is dampened near streams. Groundwater inundation is projected to contribute 48% of the total inundated area from both SLR-induced groundwater rise and marine tidal flooding in the city of Portsmouth, with consequences for built and natural resources. Freshwater wetlands are projected to expand 3% by the year 2030, increasing to 25% by the end of the century, coupled with water-depth increases.

Modeling Soil Porewater Salinity Response to Drought in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						porewater salinity; drought; saltwater intrusion; tidal freshwater forested wetlands; hydraulic conductivity; evapotranspiration	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SOUTH-CAROLINA; SALTWATER INCURSION; TAXODIUM-DISTICHUM; ORGANIC-MATTER; SAVANNA-RIVER; SALT-MARSH; GROWTH; HYDROLOGY; STRESS	There is a growing concern about the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion via tidal rivers, streams, and creeks into tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) due to sea level rise (SLR) and intense and extended drought events. However, the magnitude and duration of porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 practical salinity units, psu) and the controlling factors remain unclear. In this study, we developed a TFFW soil porewater salinity model, in which the feedback mechanisms between soil salinity and evapotranspiration and hydraulic conductivity were incorporated. We selected sites (upper, middle, lower tidal freshwater forest sites, and oligohaline marsh site) along the coastal floodplains of two rivers, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA), that represent landscape salinity gradients from tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold. Plain Language Summary Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide valuable ecosystem services to society including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, water quality improvement, and habitat for critical wildlife species. However, TFFW are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) and extreme drought events. Salinity stress to TFFW is often reflected in elevated soil porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 psu). Soil porewater salinity magnitude and dynamics at sites along two coastal floodplains, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA) exposed to drought-induced saltwater intrusion during 2008-2016 were studied using a physical and ecological process-driven soil salinity model. The mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity at TFFW sites increased significantly with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, even without SLR, compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, thus posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services in TFFW. Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator and the soil porewater salinity model can be used for predicting changes in the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of salinity stress to TFFW sites under future climate change. Key Points Drought-induced saltwater intrusion significantly increases soil porewater salinity in soils of tidal freshwater forested wetlands Tidal freshwater forest sites located near the tidal marsh boundary will suffer more severe salinity stress with climate change Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator for tidal freshwater forested wetland condition	[Wang, Hongqing] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70816 USA; [Krauss, Ken W.; Stagg, Camille] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA USA; [Noe, Gregory B.] US Geol Survey, Florence Bascom Geosci Ctr, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA; [Swarzenski, Christopher M.] US Geol Survey, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Duberstein, Jamie A.; Conner, William H.] Clemson Univ, Baruch Inst Coastal Ecol & Forest Sci, Georgetown, SC USA; [Deangelis, Donald L.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Miami, FL USA	United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Clemson University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey	Wang, HQ (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70816 USA.	wangh@usgs.gov	Noe, Gregory/A-1365-2010; Wang, Hongqing/D-2575-2014	Stagg, Camille/0000-0002-1125-7253; Wang, Hongqing/0000-0002-2977-7732; Krauss, Ken/0000-0003-2195-0729; Noe, Gregory/0000-0002-6661-2646	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Land Change Science Research and Development Program; USGS Ecosystems Mission Area; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [SCZ-1700531]	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Land Change Science Research and Development Program(United States Geological Survey); USGS Ecosystems Mission Area; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))	This research was supported by funds from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Land Change Science Research and Development Program, the USGS Ecosystems Mission Area, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture (Grant SCZ-1700531).

The changes in glacier melt may lead to droughts as well as floods in the Himalayan basins, which are vulnerable to hydrological changes. This study used an integrated glaciohydrological model, the Glacier and Snow Melt - WASMOD model (GSM-WASMOD), for hydrological projections under 21st century climate change by two ensembles of four global climate models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and two bias-correction methods (i.e., the daily bias correction (DBC) and the local intensity scaling (LOCI)) in order to assess the future hydrological changes in the Himalayan Beas basin up to Pandoh Dam (upper Beas basin). Besides, the glacier extent loss during the 21st century was also investigated as part of the glacio-hydrological modeling as an ensemble simulation. In addition, a high-resolution WRF precipitation dataset suggested much heavier winter precipitation over the high-altitude ungauged area, which was used for precipitation correction in the study. The glacio-hydrological modeling shows that the glacier ablation accounted for about 5% of the annual total runoff during 1986-2004 in this area. Under climate change, the temperature will increase by 1.8-2.8 degrees C at the middle of the century (2046-2065), and by 2.3-5.4 degrees C until the end of the century (2080-2099). It is very likely that the upper Beas basin will get warmer and wetter compared to the historical period. In this study, the glacier extent in the upper Beas basin is projected to decrease over the range of 63 %-87% by the middle of the century and 89 %-100% at the end of the century compared to the glacier extent in 2005. This loss in glacier area will in general result in a reduction in glacier discharge in the future, while the future streamflow is most likely to have a slight increase because of the increase in both precipitation and temperature under all the scenarios. However, there is widespread uncertainty regarding the changes in total discharge in the future, including the seasonality and magnitude. In general, the largest increase in river total discharge also has the largest spread. The uncertainty in future hydrological change is not only from GCMs, but also from the bias-correction methods and hydrological modeling. A decrease in discharge is found in July from DBC, while it is opposite for LOCI. Besides, there is a decrease in evaporation in September from DBC, which cannot be seen from LOCI. The study helps to understand the hydrological impacts of climate change in northern India and contributes to stakeholder and policymaker engagement in the management of future water resources in northern India.

The surface water drainage becomes necessary to lower the water table head and further prevent flooding and waterlogging. The study examines the evolution of drainage apropos to climate change and land subsidence in the three main Ravenna coastal basins. Our findings show that the evolution of drainage is influenced by land subsidence, climate change variability, droughts, vertical seepage, and local water management. Land subsidence causes an increase in upward-directed vertical seepage of saline water through the shallow unconfined aquifer into the drainage channels of the coastal basins, thus leading to an increase in drainage through time. At a seasonal timescale, the rate of pumping depends on antecedent rainfall and soil-water storage. The warming extremes indices, specifically drought indices, show to be more significant than rainfall indices trends to monitor drainage evolution. Drought indices permit easy comparison of dryness or wetness severity with drainage evolution along their time scale. The co-occurring anthropogenic and natural factors involving in the increasing drainage rate will affect decadal and seasonal water management policies in the area. The implications of increasing drainage rates, long periods of drought with limited rainfall, and increasing temperature will further worsen freshwater availability in this coastal area already experiencing soil and water salinization. However, drainage of this low-lying territory has effectively mitigated rising water tables and avoided flooding. Our study has shown that each coastal basin behaves differently in terms of sensitivity to land subsidence and climate extremes. Therefore, when using drainage data time series for water management purposes, one should account for past management practices and for the specific sensitivity of each basin to external factors.

We employ state-of-the-art global climate models from the CMIP6 project under the SSP245 scenario to evaluate changes in river runoff using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Our findings indicate that temperature fluctuations play a crucial role in streamflow dynamics, given that the primary sources of river runoff in the Upper Indus Basin are snow and glacier melting. We project a substantial increase of approximately 18% in both minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation pattern increases of 13-17%, and a significant rise in streamflow by 19-30% in the future, driven by warmer temperatures. Importantly, our analysis reveals season-specific impacts of temperature, precipitation, and streamflow, with increasing variability in projected annual changes as we progress into the mid and late 21st century. To address these changes, our findings suggest the need for integrated strategies and action plans encompassing hydroelectricity generation, irrigation, flood prevention, and reservoir storage to ensure effective water resource management in the region.

Understanding cascading risks through real-world interdependent urban infrastructure	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Cascading failures; Interdependent infrastructure; Risk analysis; Critical infrastructure; Urban infrastructure; Resilience; Network modeling	RESILIENCE; SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; FAILURE; IMPACTS	The prevalence of cascading failures is growing as infrastructure becomes more interdependent and climate change exacerbates more extreme hazards. After such events, the general focus is on the magnitude of direct damage or loss; it is less understood how events trigger failures throughout other infrastructure. In this work, we present a methodology to model direct and indirect impacts from an event for a multi-system network, including interconnected infrastructure and end users. We perform a case study of New Zealand's second largest city, Christchurch, investigating electricity, water supply, and wastewater networks following a range of coastal flooding events and climate change scenarios. For a 10-year average recurrence interval event given no sea-level rise, there is a 216% increase from directly impacted end users to the total number of end users that have lost at least one utility. For the same scenario, this metric is 71%, 129%, and 131% for end users who have lost electricity, water, and wastewater, respectively. The results show a larger estimate of impact on residents and a more geospatially-varied loss of service. This methodology provides insight for utility operators, emergency response, and communities on node criticality, areas of impact, and resource requirements after an event occurs.	[Brunner, L.

J	Carey, M; Moulton, H				Carey, Mark; Moulton, Holly			Inequalities of ice loss: a framework for addressing sociocryospheric change	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change; ice and climate; mountain glaciers	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLACIERS; FLOOD; PERCEPTIONS; GLACIOLOGY; NARRATIVES; RESPONSES; PROGRESS; IMPACTS; HISTORY	Cryospheric change occurs in unequal spaces. Societies living near ice are divided by race, class, gender, geography, politics and other factors. Consequently, impacts of ice loss are not shared equally, and everyone experiences cryospheric changes differently. Responsibility for recent ice loss is also driven by a relatively small portion of humanity: those who emit the most greenhouse gases. Additionally, people who study the cryosphere come from institutions and societies where inequality is often systemic, making research on ice and snow a symptom of and contributor to social inequality. To better understand unequal effects of cryospheric change within and across diverse communities, including research communities, this paper focuses on three areas, drawing primarily from glacier-related work: (1) the social context of cryospheric changes; (2) attribution and responsibility for cryospheric changes and (3) imbalances in knowledge about the cryosphere. Addressing these dimensions of ice loss requires transdisciplinary approaches that connect research to societies and link glaciology and other cryospheric sciences with social sciences and humanities. These concepts, cases and suggestions to help address inequalities also reveal that no singular conceptualization of sustainability exists. Different societies, residents and researchers possess distinct understandings of and goals for 'ice in a sustainable society'.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Migration decisions; environmental events; adaptation planning; Bangladesh	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLACE ATTACHMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CYCLONE; RISK; THRESHOLDS; HOUSEHOLDS; SALINITY; MOBILITY	Migration is often understood to be a livelihood strategy to cope with the effects of environmental threats and climate change. Yet, the extent to which migration decisions differ due to the type, severity, and frequency of environmental events has been little explored. This paper employs household surveys in southwestern Bangladesh to explore this research gap. A multinominal regression model is used to simulate reported future migration decisions (200 sample households) in the context of both rapid-onset (i.e. cyclone and flood) and slow-onset (salinity, siltation, and riverbank erosion) environmental phenomena. Results show: i) previous disaster experience and increasing conflict in the community motivate migration in the near future in the context of slow-onset phenomena (salinity); (ii) economic strength and self-efficacy increase non-migration intention in both contexts of sudden and slow-onset events; and (iii) the extent and pattern of these influences on migration differ across demographics, including education, religion, and age. Importantly, this analysis shows that the relationship between migration decisions and the type, severity, and frequency of environmental events is influenced by socioeconomic conditions. Therefore, this research supports future adaptation planning specifically tailored to the type and exposure of extreme environmental events.

J	Ayyad, M; Hajj, MR; Marsooli, R				Ayyad, Mahmoud; Hajj, Muhammad R.; Marsooli, Reza			Artificial intelligence for hurricane storm surge hazard assessment	OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial Neural Network; Storm surge; Tropical cyclones; Return period	NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; MODEL; WIND	Risk-informed coastal management requires assessment of extreme flood hazards from a large number of storm scenarios. To account for impact of climate change based on potential variations in greenhouse gas concentration and climate models, the number of storm scenarios would be even larger. Although physics-based hydrodynamic numerical models could predict flood levels and their impact from storm scenarios, the high computational cost of the solutions hinders the ability to perform the required number of simulations. Towards alleviating that cost, we show that physics-based simulations can be combined with Artificial Neural Network models to support more faster and effective prediction of low-probability events that account for uncertainties associated with climate change. We show this capability by predicting 10, 100, and 1,000 years return periods for peak storm surge height at a specific location on an idealized coastline. A large data set of synthetic tropical cyclones is generated from physics-based simulations and used for training, validating and testing the constructed neural network model. The ANN predicted values are validated against values from the physics-based simulations. The advantage of the combined approach is that, once the training was complete, it was performed in a fraction of the time required for the physics-based simulations.

The evaluation of FIR is essential for mitigating economic losses, and even casualties. This study proposes an innovative spatial framework integrating improved k-nearest neighbor (kNN), remote sensing (RS), and geographic information system (GIS) to analyze FIR for tourism sites. Shanghai, China, was selected as a case study. Tempo-spatial factors, including climate, topography, drainage, vegetation, and soil, were selected to generate several flood-related gridded indicators as inputs into the evaluation framework. A likelihood of FIR was mapped to represent possible inundation for tourist sites under a moderate-heavy rainfall scenario and extreme rainfall scenario. The resultant map was verified by the maximum inundation extent merged by RS images and water bodies. The evaluation outcomes deliver the baseline and scientific information for urban planners and policymakers to take cost-effective measures for decreasing and evading the pressure of FIR on the sustainable development of urban tourism. The spatial improved-kNN-based framework provides an innovative, effective, and easy-to-use approach to evaluate the risk for the tourism industry under climate change.

However, NBS realization depends critically on the governance framework that enables the NBS policy process. Drawing from three case studies in Nocera Inferiore (Italy), Munich (Germany), and Wolong (China), we identify key governance enablers-the contextual preconditions, policy processes, and institutions-that proved essential for NBS initiation, planning, design, and implementation. In the three cases, interviews confirm the success of the NBS measures and their benefits in terms not only of DRR but of multiple ecological and social-economic co-benefits. Results highlight critical governance enablers of NBS, including: polycentric governance (novel arrangements in the public administration that involved multiple institutional scales and/or sectors); co-design (innovative stakeholder participatory processes that influenced the final NBS); pro-NBS interest and coalition groups (organized pressure groups that advocated for an NBS); and financial incentives (financing community-based implementation and monitoring of NBS). Findings show that the transition to NBS can contribute to multiple global agendas, including DRR, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development.	[Martin, Juliette G.

The root of these challenges lies in the downright explosion in global population over the last decades combined with a staggering increase of urbanization rates leading to an unprecedented level of demand for food, water, materials and space. Consequently, growing scarcity of essential resources are an ever increasing threat towards global peace and stability. This conflict potential is exacerbated by global warming and the associated sea level rise, which can once again be traced back to the rapidly growing demand for energy and food of the world's economies. In this paper we develop a comprehensive chain of cause and effect surrounding these global developments. Furthermore, we discuss how floating infrastructure, through its application to renewable energy generation, food production, flood protection and even urban expansion, is capable of decoupling multiple linkages in the chain, thus presenting itself as a promising mid- to long-term strategy for addressing these global challenges.

Local weather affects body condition of three North American songbird species on the Texas Coast	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						avian ecology; climate change; conservation; hurricane; physiology; resilience	DISTANCE MIGRATORY BIRD; GENERALIZED ADDITIVE-MODELS; AVIAN COMMUNITY RESPONSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; FITNESS; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; FLUCTUATIONS; TEMPERATURE	Body condition is a frequently used physiological indicator of avian health and can be affected by an array of environmental variables. Although a number of studies have investigated the specific effects of individual weather variables on body condition in birds, few have analyzed the effects of both temperature and precipitation within the context of an extreme weather event such as hurricanes. In this study, we examined the relationship between breeding-season body condition and daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, and monthly total precipitation for three passerine bird species at the Welder Wildlife Refuge near Rockport, Texas. We also evaluated yearly changes in body condition over a 12-year period for northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), painted buntings (Passerina ciris), and white-eyed vireos (Vireo griseus), focusing on the extreme precipitation event of Hurricane Harvey, which caused heavy localized flooding. We found that body condition declined with average daily minimum and maximum temperatures, while precipitation had varied, species-specific effects in the three species analyzed. Our results also suggest that northern cardinals experienced a notable reduction in average body condition in the 2 years following Hurricane Harvey. Taken together, we conclude that short-term precipitation and temperature drivers can be important correlates of body condition in songbirds and that severe weather events may reduce body condition in some bird species.

Often, the steady and progressive trends (or presses) of rising global temperature are the central focus in how climate impacts are described. However, observations of extreme weather events (or pulses) increasingly show that the intensity, duration and/or frequency of acute events are also changing, resulting in greater impacts on communities and the environment. Describing how the influence of extreme events may shape water management in the Colorado River Basin in clear terms is critical to sound future planning and efforts to manage risk. Three scenario planning workshops in 2019 and 2020 were held as part of a Colorado River Conversations series, identifying potential impacts from multiple intersecting extreme events. Water managers identified climate-related events of concern in the Colorado River Basin that necessitate greater attention and adaptive responses.

Event scale hydrograph responses highlight impacts of widespread stream burial and urban infrastructure failures	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						buried streams; hydrograph analysis; infrastructure; rainfall-runoff responses; stormwater; urbanization	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE; URBANIZATION; QUANTIFICATION; INFILTRATION; RUNOFF; SEWERS; PATTERNS; BASEFLOW; LEAKAGE	Fast hydrologic responses to storms in urban areas are often attributed to high percentages of impervious surfaces; however, another factor affecting urban storm response is channel burial. No previous studies have documented storm event responses in buried streams despite how common stream burial is in urban areas, with some US cities having over 75% of all headwater channels buried. Understanding event dynamics is particularly important as climate change predictions suggest an increase in frequency of high intensity storms and urban flooding. This study used 15-min precipitation and discharge data over a period of 6.5 years to categorize storm event responses in Nine Mile Run, an urban watershed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where 98% of all channels are buried. Extensive stream burial led to lower watershed retention capacity and resulted in faster storm event responses relative to other urban streams with comparable imperviousness. Additionally, urban water subsidies in the form of sewer overflows, hydrant flushing, or water line breaks can have measurable contributions to flow event responses and result in seemingly unfeasible runoff ratios. This study demonstrates novel watershed runoff responses in systems dominated by subsurface infrastructure, which play a key role in urban water balance. Additionally, this study highlights the fact that stream restoration is not a universal solution to urban stream flashiness because downstream restoration cannot resolve the impacts of upstream burial.

However, public perception of water infrastructure at risk of flooding has not been explicitly addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate flood risk perception, the factors that influence it, and evaluations of water infrastructure systems. To examine this, data were obtained from a public survey of 755 respondents in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. Risk perception is measured as three components: worry, awareness, and preparedness. Structural equation modeling was used to develop and test a model tracing the interrelationships between risk perception, disaster experience, satisfaction with infrastructure services, knowledge of water infrastructure, socioeconomic characteristics, and political views. Results show that flood risk perception elements (awareness, worry, preparedness) significantly influence public evaluation of water infrastructure conditions and mediate the impact of flood experience, service satisfaction, and knowledge. Evaluation of water infrastructure is positively associated with knowledge and service satisfaction but negatively with flood experience. The study also confirms the importance of socio-economic characteristics in shaping public risk perception and evaluation of infrastructure. These findings imply multiple ways that decision-makers may enhance flood risk management plans and adaptation processes of water infrastructure systems in coastal urban areas.

Urban basins have less storage capacity and more rapid runoff, so urban rivers rise more quickly during storms and have higher peak discharge rates than rural catchments. An exemplary case of this situation is the city of Milan (northern Italy) and its whole territory that extends towards the north collecting meteoric precipitation through the Seveso, Olona and Lambro (SOL) rivers. To assess the impact of anthropogenic development on urban catchment scale hydrology, a reanalysis of 40 years of simulations was carried out with the Curve Number (CN) map based on current land use and compared to simulations using the CN maps based on past land use. A coupled hydro-meteorological system was built that combined a physically based rainfall-runoff hydrological model FEST-WB, developed by the Politecnico di Milano, with the ERA5-Land hourly dataset for the period 1981 to 2020, that was provided by the ECMWF under the framework of the Copernicus Climate Change Service Programme. The study (named SOL40) analyses 40 year trends in the main meteorological (air temperature, precipitation) and hydrological variables (runoff) over the SOL area and tried to quantify and separate the impact of land use change from that of climate change.

This research used precipitation indices to describe variations in extreme precipitation and analyzed the characteristics of extreme precipitation in four climatic (arid, semi-arid, semi-humid and humid) regions across China. The equidistant cumulative distribution function (EDCDF) method was used to downscale and bias-correct daily precipitation in eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). From 1961 to 2005, the humid region had stronger and longer extreme precipitation compared with the other regions. In the future, the projected extreme precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer, and there will be large areas with substantial changes in maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5) and precipitation intensity (SDII). The greatest differences between two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are in semi-arid and semi-humid areas for summer precipitation anomalies. However, the area of the four regions with an increasing trend of extreme precipitation is larger under the RCP8.5 scenario than that under the RCP4.5 scenario. The increasing trend of extreme precipitation in the future is relatively pronounced, especially in humid areas, implying a potential heightened flood risk in these areas.

J	Schlef, KE; François, B; Brown, C				Schlef, Katherine E.; Francois, Baptiste; Brown, Casey			Comparing Flood Projection Approaches Across Hydro-Climatologically Diverse United States River Basins	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RESERVOIR INDEXES; RISK; STATIONARITY; DEAD; TEMPERATURE; TRANSLATE; INCREASES; MODELS	The challenge of estimating design flood magnitude under climate change has led to the development of multiple approaches to long-term flood projection: stationarity, informed-parameter (composed of both trend informed and climate informed), and hydrologic simulation. This is the first study to compare these approaches across a large set of hydro-climatologically diverse basins located throughout the contiguous United States, grouped into distinct clusters based on catchment and flood characteristics. The comparison is achieved using a split-sample test conducted over the historic period; the climate (specifically, precipitation) informed and hydrologic simulation (specifically, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model) approaches are forced with observations and downscaled general circulation model (GCM) simulations. The results provide a quantitative perspective on key long-term flood projection issues. The precipitation informed approach can be informative for projections of regional change; the hydrologic simulation approach can be informative for direction of change for a single basin. When forced with GCM outputs, precipitation informed is both more accurate and more precise than hydrologic simulation, after accounting for model error. For hydrologic simulation, forcing with GCMs will add positive bias for basins in the Rocky Mountains and Southwest and will add negative bias with large uncertainty across GCMs for basins in the lower Midwest, the South, and the mid-Atlantic seaboard. The results illustrate the need for continued improvement in long-term flood projection approaches and for design paradigms incorporating uncertainty.

There are several factors which influence the motivation to implement flood risk management strategies such as property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) measures. This paper assesses and evaluates the role of risk communication, which is a vital and overarching driver or barrier in the successful implementation of PLFRA measures. We explored this issue through a bootstrapped Q-methodology with 20 residents in the urban area of Graz, Austria, who have been affected by flood events in the past. Additionally, semi-structured interviews concerning risk communication were conducted with the participants to understand the preferred risk communication modes. The results show that respondents have a high level of perceived self-efficacy (most have implemented PLFRA measures), that there is general distrust in public protection measures and that there is a high understanding of residual risk. Considering the communication modes preferred by a majority of respondents, face-to-face interaction with unbiased experts is more attractive than online applications. Additionally, citizens want to be engaged in decision -making processes concerning public protection measures in their area. This calls for participatory processes in flood risk management which involve mutual knowledge transfer and social learning.

For this reason, there is a need to incorporate both human and climatic components in models of flood risk. This study simulates behavioral influences on the evolution of community flood risk under different future climate scenarios using an agent-based model (ABM). The objective is to understand better the ways, sometimes unexpected, that human behavior, stochastic floods, and community interventions interact to influence the evolution of flood risk. One historic climate scenario and three future climate scenarios are simulated using a case study location in Fargo, North Dakota. Individual agents can mitigate flood risk via household mitigation or by moving, based on decision rules that consider risk perception and coping perception. The community can mitigate or disseminate information to reduce flood risk. Results show that agent behavior and community action have a significant impact on the evolution of flood risk under different climate scenarios. In all scenarios, individual and community action generally result in a decline in damages over time. In a lower flood risk scenario, the decline is primarily due to agent mitigation, while in a high flood risk scenario, community mitigation and agent relocation are primary drivers of the decline. Adaptive behaviors offset some of the increase in flood risk associated with climate change, and under an extreme climate scenario, our model indicates that many agents relocate.

Using the Pooled Mean Group estimation method, this study investigates the long run and short run relationship of ENSO impact on Southeast Asia paddy production from 1961 to 2014 with Oceanic Ni?o Index, Ni?o 3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies, Southern Oscillation Index and Multivariate ENSO Index. This study also investigates four different ENSO intensities with Multivariate ENSO Index to determine their long run and short run impact on paddy production. The findings reveal that the ENSO effect is exclusively captured by Multivariate ENSO Index among four climate change variables. Furthermore, ENSO arrival during the paddy planting season caused a paddy reduction in the long run. Specifically, the arrival of a moderate La Ni?a during the paddy planting season has a greater impact on paddy reduction in the long run compared to a strong El Ni?o. In addition, moderate and strong La Ni?a caused higher paddy production in the short run. Further research can be carried out by including spatial and temporal ENSO impacts on paddy planting season with single cultivation method.

Probabilistic assessment of port operation downtimes under climate change	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; WAVE CLIMATE; OCEAN WAVES; FLOOD RISK; IMPACTS; OPERABILITY; PROJECTIONS; REANALYSIS; EROSION; MODELS	Disruptions in harbor operations have significant implications for local, regional and global economies due to ports strategic role as part of the supply chain. A probabilistic evaluation of port operations considering the influence of climate change is required in order to secure optimal exploitation during their useful life. Here, we propose a hybrid statistic-dynamical framework combining a weather generator and a metamodel. The stochastic generator is based on weather types to project climate variability on hourly multivariate dependent climate drivers outside ports. The metamodel efficiently transforms hourly sea conditions from the entrance of the harbor towards the inside port adding the advantages of a physical process model. Thousands of hourly synthetic time series based on present climate conditions and future ones were transferred inside the port to perform a probabilistic analysis of port operations. Future forcing conditions were defined adding several sea level rise (SLR) scenarios, sampled from their probability distribution, to the synthetic sea level fluctuation time series. Wave amplification due to nonlinear interactions between wave and sea level variations and changes in the reflection coefficients inside the port induced by SLR were modelled. Probabilistic future changes of operation downtimes were quantified considering the uncertainty associated with the historical forcing conditions outside the port and likely SLR scenarios. The methodology was applied to a specific case study on a regional port located in the north coast of Spain, were port operability due to wave agitation was assessed.

Assessing the impacts of climate change on climatic extremes in the Congo River Basin	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Congo River Basin; Climate indices; Droughts; Floods; Precipitation; Evapotranspiration; Downscaling; RCM; SPEI; SPI	MODEL; AFRICAN	The Congo River Basin, located in central Africa, is the second-largest river basin in the world, after the Amazon. It has a drainage area of approximately 3.7 M km(2) and is home to 75 million people. A significant part of the population is exposed to recurrent floods and droughts, and climate change is likely to worsen these events. Climate change studies of the Congo River basin have so far focused on annual and seasonal precipitation, but little attention was paid to extreme climatic events. This study aims to assess future changes in rainfall-induced flash floods and drought regimes in the Congo basin from the present day to 2100, using four selected extreme climatic indices as proxies to these two natural disasters. The indices are the total annual precipitation (PCPTOT), the number of days where rainfall is above 20 mm (PCP20), the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The indices were calculated with the statistically downscaled output of eleven Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-AFRICA) under two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP 8.5 (high emissions scenario) and RCP 4.5 (moderate emissions scenario). Precipitation and temperature simulated by the RCMs were statistically downscaled using quantile mapping, while wind speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity were projected using K-nearest neighbor downscaling. The evolution of the indices was then assessed between the reference period (1976-2005) and three future periods (2011-2040, 20412070, and 2071-2100). Multimodel average results suggest that (i) independently of the scenario and period, PCPTOT and SPI will increase in the north, east, and western extremities of the basin and decrease in the basin's center. (ii) The maximum increase (+ 24%) and decrease (- 6%) in PCPTOT were both projected under RCP 8.5 in the 2071-2100 period. (iii) PCP20 will increase independently of the period and scenario. Under RCP 8.5, in the 2071-2100 period, PCP20 will increase by 94% on average over the whole watershed. (iv) The SPEI results suggest that in all periods and scenarios, the rise in evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures will offset annual precipitation increases in the north, east, and western extremities of the basin. Increased evaporation will exacerbate the decrease in annual precipitation in the center, leading to increased drought frequency in the entire basin.

J	Doshi, D; Garschagen, M				Doshi, Deepal; Garschagen, Matthias			Ruptures in perceived solution spaces for adaptation to flood risk: Heuristic insights from Mumbai and general lessons	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptation options; Solution space; Social contract; Actor-oriented; Feasibility assessment; Mumbai	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISHING COMMUNITIES; VULNERABILITY	Adaptation to increasing impacts of climate change will require societies to design portfolios of risk management solutions by selecting from an array of available adaptation options. A major step on the way towards a strong social contract for adaptation is understanding how different actors view different adaptation options. Here we adopt an actor-oriented multi-dimensional framework to understand how different actors evaluate their perceived adaptation solution space. The aim is to understand who identifies which adaptation options and how they are assessed. We build on the feasibility assessment used in IPCC's sixth assessment report and explore the framework by applying it to the solution space for flood risk in Mumbai. We draw on empirical data collected through key informant interviews with state, civil society and academic actors. Our findings show that, overall, actors see most need for adaptation measures in relation to institutional changes, e.g. in relation to planning procedures and a shift in risk management paradigms. While actors show consensus on the importance of green infrastructure, we find stark differences in their perception of grey infrastructure measures. In terms of the factors perceived to enable or constrain adaptation, actors agree on the pivotal role of institutional aspects as even more important than financial or technical factors. This study makes an empirical and analytical contribution to advance feasibility assessments by including actor perceptions and their evaluation of options in real world settings.

A multi-vulnerability and exposure assessment approach	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Climate adaptation planning; Climate change vulnerability; Multi-criteria analysis; Sustainable urban planning; GIS technique	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DESIGN; MODEL	Urban planning for adaptation to climate change privileges the construction of cognitive frameworks developed through the use of new spatial technologies and open-source databases. The significant and most highly innovative aspect concerns how resilience to CC under conditions of vulnerability and risk is defined, monitored and assessed.Based on these premises, this paper aims to explore a new methodology of climate vulnerability, exposure and risk analysis through multicriteria assessment techniques by activating a case study in the coastal municipality of Jesolo (Italy).Taking into consideration three main weather-climate impacts (Urban Flooding, Coastal Flooding and Urban Heat Island) the methodology searches for the best geo-referenced data that can best describe the recognizing impact of the cumulative impact condition through testing a GIS-based multi-attribute exploratory procedure. Intersectoral and multilevel vulnerability conditions at different spatial scales are configured.The analysis methodology continues using open source data (from Open Street Map) to construct local exposure information layers. Exposure combined with spatial vulnerability conditions allows the generation of multi-hazard mapping.Experimentation with multi-hazard climate-oriented spatial assessment can guide planning and public decision-making in new policy domains and target mitigation and adaptation actions in land planning, management and regulation practices.Finally, the proposed methodology can activate stakeholder engagement processes within municipalities to discuss the actual perceived risk and begin a collaborative journey with citizens to identify best practices and solutions to adopt in the areas indicated by the risk mapping.

Move, migrate, or tolerate: Quantifying three tactics for cold-water fish coping with warm summers in a large river	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						behavioral thermoregulation; climate change; floodplain river; refuge; thermal heterogeneity; tolerance	COASTAL CUTTHROAT TROUT; CLIMATE-CHANGE REFUGIA; WILLAMETTE RIVER; THERMAL TOLERANCE; CHINOOK SALMON; REDBAND TROUT; TEMPERATURE; ABUNDANCE; HABITAT; RAINBOW	Mainstem rivers are important for provisioning cold-water fisheries and often support fluvial life histories that grow much larger than resident counterparts in tributaries. However, mainstem rivers are also warmer than tributaries during summer and more tightly coupled to regional climate. A key challenge is to understand how fluvial life histories cope with summer temperatures in mainstem rivers, both now and in a warmer future. Here, we outline three options: tolerance, exploitation of cool microhabitats, or migration to cooler tributaries. We quantified the relative prevalence of these responses in the wild using a Lagrangian approach. Specifically, we used temperature transmitting radio-tags to track coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) habitat use across 100 km of the Willamette River, which exhibited a maximum temperature of 22 degrees C. We found that 89.8% of fish stayed in the mainstem and tolerated high temperatures; 6.5% of the population exploited cool floodplain alcoves; and 3.7% moved into a cool tributary, the McKenzie River. We also found that on average, larger fish opted to use cold-water refuge habitats rather than tolerate mainstem river temperatures. The expression of all three coping tactics suggests this population has adaptive capacity to respond to future warming. More work is needed to understand how the relative expression of these tactics change depending on the severity of heat stress or nontemperature attributes of mainstem, floodplain, and tributary habitat.

As a result, the importance of predicting future climate has become even direr. The statistical downscaling approach was introduced as a solution to provide high-resolution climate projections. An effective statistical downscaling scheme aimed to be developed in this study is a two-phase machine learning technique for daily rainfall projection in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The proposed approaches will counter the emerging issues. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on a symmetric correlation matrix is applied in order to rectify the issue of selecting predictors for a two-phase supervised model and help reduce the dimension of the supervised model. Secondly, two-phase machine learning techniques are introduced with a predictor selection mechanism. The first phase is a classification using Support Vector Classification (SVC) that determines dry and wet days. Subsequently, regression estimates the amount of rainfall based on the frequency of wet days using Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Relevant Vector Machines (RVMs). The comparison between hybridization models' outcomes reveals that the hybrid of SVC and RVM reproduces the most reasonable daily rainfall prediction and considers high-precipitation extremes. The hybridization model indicates an improvement in predicting climate change predictions by establishing a relationship between the predictand and predictors.

Dammar Char is situated in the southeastern (SE) coastal region of Bangladesh that has experienced frequent coastal hazards and disasters throughout the year. The present study has constructed a vulnerability index utilizing the quantitative and qualitative data based on household surveys to evaluate the vulnerability of the people and community of Dammar Char. Data were collected from 180 respondents during November-December 2018. The results demonstrate that, on average, the people living in the studied area have a high vulnerability (value of the vulnerability index 0.7015) to coastal hazards and disasters. The vulnerability level differs from individual to individual based on their gender, educational status, financial capacity, structural strength of houses, perception of the respective hazards and disasters, etc. Females have experienced more vulnerability than their adult male counterparts. The natural vulnerability was higher than socioeconomic and physical vulnerability due to the increase in unpredictable extreme climate-induced coastal events. To combat the adverse impacts of coastal hazards and disasters, the local Dammar Char inhabitants have adopted several adaptation measures. The adapted measures are homestead gardening, working in seasonal day labor, fish drying, rearing sheep, and ducks, constructing plinths for elevating the floor of the house, extensive banana cultivation, and storage of dry foods to reduce their vulnerability.

This study presents results of using Local and Indigenous Knowledge in selecting indicators for mapping the vulnerability of people to flood hazards in an informal settlement context. Using Quarry Road West informal settlement, the study employed a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach which involved a household survey (n = 359), interviews with key informants (n = 8) and a focus group discussion (n = 1). The study findings reveal that flood vulnerability in the study area is not only a result of the proximity of the houses to the Palmiet River, the M19 freeway and Quarry Road, but also as a result of the nature of the soil and the type of materials people use to build their houses. Furthermore, findings reveal that using both Local and Indigenous Knowledge possessed by community members, a minimal number (sixteen) of context-specific indicators for mapping flood vulnerability in the study area were selected. The study also finds that flood vulnerability in the study area is a result of physical, socio-economic and institutional problems. Therefore, using Local and Indigenous Knowledge to select indicators for mapping flood vulnerability helps to provide a better understanding of flood vulnerability in an informal settlement and this gives decision-makers and other stakeholders a glimpse of adaptive measures that can be implemented to increase people's resilience.

J	Park, K; Choi, SH; Yu, I				Park, Kiyong; Choi, Sang-Hyun; Yu, Insang			Risk Type Analysis of Building on Urban Flood Damage	WATER			English	Article						climate change; urban flood damage; flood risk; vulnerability; exposure	REDUCTION	Climate change caused by global warming has resulted in an increase in average temperature and changes in precipitation pattern and intensity. Consequently, this has led to an increase in localized heavy rain which intensifies the uncertainty of the development of urban areas. To minimize flood damage in an urban area, this study aims to analyze the flood risk effect on buildings by ranking the risk of flood damage for each building type and sorting the long-term land use plan and the building type that requires particular consideration. To evaluate the flood risk of each building type, vulnerability analysis and exposure analysis were conducted in five regions of the Ulsan City. The vulnerability analysis includes determination of each building type by using the building elements which are sensitive to flood damage. In terms of the exposure analysis, environmental factors were applied to analyze the flood depth. The mapping based on the results from two analyses provided the basis for classifying the flood risk into five classes (green, yellowish green, yellow, orange, red). The results were provided in the urban spatial form for each building type. This analysis shows that the district near the Taehwa river is the area with the highest risk class buildings (red and orange class buildings). Notably, this area plays a pivotal functional role in administrating the Ulsan City and has a high density of buildings. This phenomenon is explained by city development which is centered around the lowland; however, given the high value of property, the potential risk is proven to be high.

The use of physics-based models of natural hazards in risk-informed planning and decision-making frameworks may provide an improved understanding of site-specific hazard scenarios, allowing various decision makers to more accurately consider the consequences of their decisions on risks in future development. We present results of physics-based simulations of flood, earthquake, and debris flow scenarios in a virtual urban testbed. The effect of climate change, in terms of increasing rainfall intensity, is also incorporated into some of the considered hazard scenarios. We use our results to highlight the importance of using physics-based models applied to high-resolution urban plans to provide dynamic hazard information at the building level for different development options. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that including building elevations into digital elevation models is crucial for predicting the routing of hazardous flows through future urban landscapes. We show that simulations of multiple, independent hazards can assist with the identification of developing urban regions that are vulnerable to potential multi-hazard events. This information can direct further modelling to provide decision-makers with insights into potential multi-hazard events. Finally, we reflect on how information derived from physics-based hazard models can be effectively used in risk-sensitive planning and decision-making.

Coastal foredunes represent the most important natural flood barriers along coastlines worldwide, but their area has been squeezed dramatically because of a continuing urbanization of coastlines, especially in Europe. Dune development is steered by the development of vegetation in interaction with sand fluxes from the beach. Marram grass (Calamagrostis arenaria, formerly Ammophila arenaria) is the main dune building species along most European coasts, but also in other continents where the species was introduced. Engineering of coastal dunes, for instance by building dunes in front of dikes, needs to be based on a solid understanding of the species' interactions with the environment. Only quantitative approaches enable the further development of mechanistic models and coastal management strategies that encapsulate these biomorphogenic interactions. We here provide a quantitative review of the main biotic and physical interactions that affect marram grass performance, their interactions with sand fluxes and how they eventually shape dune development. Our review highlights that the species' spatial organization is central to dune development. We further demonstrate this importance by means of remote sensing and a mechanistic model and provide an outlook for further research on the use of coastal dunes as a nature-based solution for coastal protection.</p>	[Bonte, Dries; Batsleer, Femke; Vandegehuchte, Martijn L.; Van De Walle, Ruben; Matheve, Hans; Hillaert, Jasmijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium; [Provoost, Sam; Hillaert, Jasmijn] Res Inst Nat & Forest, Brussels, Belgium; [Reijers, Valerie] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vandegehuchte, Martijn L.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Dan, Sebastian; Suzuki, Tomohiro] Flanders Hydraul Res, Antwerp, Belgium; [Rauwoens, Pieter; Strypsteen, Glenn] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Brugge, Belgium	Ghent University; Research Institute for Nature & Forest; Utrecht University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Flanders Hydraulics Research (FHR); KU Leuven	Bonte, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Ghent, Belgium.	dries.bonte@ugent.be	Rauwoens, Pieter/JFB-3225-2023; Dan, Sebastian/IQS-2658-2023; Batsleer, Femke/GPK-8164-2022; Bonte, Dries/AAH-3913-2021; Provoost, Sam/H-7278-2013	Rauwoens, Pieter/0000-0002-8226-6536; Batsleer, Femke/0000-0001-5893-5966; Bonte, Dries/0000-0002-3320-7505; Provoost, Sam/0000-0003-2751-5269; Van De Walle, Ruben/0000-0001-5519-0153; Hillaert, Jasmijn/0000-0002-3761-8846; Dan, Sebastian/0000-0003-2470-1939; Vandegehuchte, Martijn L./0000-0003-1283-4654	Interreg 2 seas project Endure [BOF.24Y.2021.0012.01]; Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)	Interreg 2 seas project Endure; Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)(FWO)	This research was done with financial support by the Interreg 2 seas project Endure.

A call for reducing tourism risk to environmental hazards in the Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Editorial Material						tourism safety; hazard preparedness; climate change; mobility; access; overcrowding; commercialisation; systems dynamics	LAKE OUTBURST FLOODS; EVEREST BASE CAMP; CARRYING-CAPACITY; KEDARNATH DISASTER; UTTARAKHAND; NEPAL; LANDSLIDES; MANAGEMENT; REGION; VULNERABILITY	As mountain tourism rapidly expands in remote landscapes, there is a critical need for improved disaster risk management to ensure the safety of tourists and industry workers, safeguard infrastructure designed to support tourism and service industries (e.g., transportation), as well as protect the local economies that have come to depend on tourism revenue. Drawing from recent disasters in the Himalaya, we present evidence that the promotion of safe and sustainable tourism is out of sync with the proliferation of inbound tourists who are prone to many types of environmental hazards. The key driver of this situation is commercialisation. Other factors include increased mobilities/access of tourists who are often unaware of or ill-prepared to cope with hazards; lack of regulations with respect to overcrowding, safety and building codes increased exposure to climate change phenomena; and limited disaster response capabilities, including responsibility at the local level. In this perspective we argue that this particularly complex situation is best addressed through the lens of a dynamic system, whereby strong leadership, increased regulation of access and participation, and enhanced professionalism via training are key leverage points in countering uncontrolled commercialisation that drives increased risk to known hazards. The inclusion of tourism into disaster risk management systems is also needed where hazard risks and tourist traffic are high, as tourists are part of the transient population who are often unfamiliar with local conditions and ill-prepared to cope with extreme adversity.

This paper compares contrasting policies and programs in two Canadian jurisdictions, Pointe Gatineau, Quebec and Constance Bay, Ontario-both of which experienced major flooding from the Ottawa River in 2017 and 2019. The floods highlighted the need for government interventions, including disaster recovery compensation and property buyouts, to support homeowners through the recovery process. This research adopts the Protect, Accommodate, Retreat and Avoid (PARA) framework to characterize and evaluate the different policy responses to the flood events in the two provinces in the broader context of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Through qualitative research methods, the study assessed the strengths and weakness of the provincial policy responses, explained why different policies were created in Ontario and Quebec (despite sharing a common river and flood risks), described how the policy deployment strategies evolved and examined how the programs prompted homeowners to make the decision to either retreat or rebuild. Both case studies involved reviewing flood timelines and recovery efforts, examining the disaster recovery policies implemented and assessing the application of property buyouts in flooded communities. The case studies were then compared to draw out cross-case insights. The paper concludes with lessons for designing effective property buyout programs. This study is intended to assist policymakers to make informed, evidence-based decisions that can protect communities from inundations risks and build long-term resilience against flood hazards.

The aim of this study was to complete flood modeling of the Ceviz Stream, which passes through flood-prone Ceviz village, located on a major coastal highway in Ordu Province in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey. More intense rainfall events in the region due to the impact of climate change have led to an increase in flood events in recent years. Due to insufficient flow data in the study area, synthetic unit hydrograph methods were used to estimate flood flow rates. A MIKE FLOOD 1D/2D coupled model was used to describe the overflow zones. The model was calibrated with the data from the major flood event in 2018. Modeling results were assimilated into the ArcGIS environment and different types of flood danger maps were created. Flood risk was calculated with the Dinh, FRMG and FEMA methods, and the results were compared. The results of the study demonstrated that people in Ceviz village and public and private assets are under considerable threat of flooding. Government agencies in Ordu Province can use the generated data and mapping to assist in the development of a holistic suite of policies, plans and actions that minimize the societal and economic impacts of flooding on Ceviz village and coastal highway users.

Uncertainties in coastal flood risk assessments in small island developing states	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; STORM-SURGE; DAMAGE; MODEL; SCALE; CONFIGURATION; IMPACTS; SYSTEM	Considering the likely increase in coastal flooding in small island developing states (SIDSs) due to climate change, coastal managers at the local and global levels have been developing initiatives aimed at implementing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and adaptation measures. Developing science-based adaptation policies requires accurate coastal flood risk (CFR) assessments, which in the case of insular states are often subject to input uncertainty. We analysed the impact of a number of uncertain inputs on coastal flood damage estimates: (i) significant wave height, (ii) storm surge level and (iii) sea level rise (SLR) contributions to extreme sea levels, as well as the error-driven uncertainty in (iv) bathymetric and (v) topographic datasets, (vi) damage models, and (vii) socioeconomic changes. The methodology was tested through a sensitivity analysis using an ensemble of hydrodynamic models (XBeach and SFINCS) coupled with a direct impact model (Delft-FIAT) for a case study of a number of villages on the islands of Sao Tome and Principe. Model results indicate that for the current time horizon, depth damage functions (DDFs) and digital elevation models (DEMs) dominate the overall damage estimation uncertainty. When introducing climate and socioeconomic uncertainties to the analysis, SLR projections become the most relevant input for the year 2100 (followed by DEM and DDF). In general, the scarcity of reliable input data leads to considerable predictive uncertainty in CFR assessments in SIDSs. The findings of this research can help to prioritize the allocation of limited resources towards the acquisitions of the most relevant input data for reliable impact estimation.

A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions-in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely, how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design, out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies, and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection. We conclude with a summary of recommendations for dynamic water resources planning under climate change through the lens of optimal control.

J	van der Pol, TD; Hinkel, J				van der Pol, Thomas David; Hinkel, Jochen			Uncertainty representations of mean sea-level change: a telephone game?	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							ROBUST DECISION-MAKING; FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; SCENARIOS; VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY; EXPOSURE	For the long-term management of coastal flood risks, investment and policy strategies need to be developed in light of the full range of uncertainties associated with mean sea-level rise (SLR). This, however, remains a challenge due to deep uncertainties involved in SLR assessments, many ways of representing uncertainties and a lack of common terminology for referring to these. To contribute to addressing these limitations, this paper first develops a typology of representations of SLR uncertainty by categorising these at three levels: (i) SLR scenarios versus SLR predictions, (ii) the type of variable that is used to represent SLR uncertainty, and (iii) partial versus complete uncertainty representations. Next, it is analysed how mean SLR uncertainty is represented and how representations are converted within the following three strands of literature: SLR assessments, impact assessments and decision analyses. We find that SLR assessments mostly produce partial or complete precise probabilistic scenarios. The likely ranges in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are a noteworthy example of partial imprecise probabilistic scenarios. SLR impact assessments and decision analyses mostly use deterministic scenarios. In conversions of uncertainty representations, a range of arbitrary assumptions are made, for example on functional forms of probability distributions and relevant confidence levels. The loss of quality and the loss of information can be reduced by disregarding deterministic and complete precise probabilistic predictions for decisions with time horizons of several decades or centuries and by constructing imprecise probabilistic predictions and using these in approaches for robust decision-making.

To tackle these issues, the specific urban water management strategy known as Sponge City has been implemented in China since 2013. This is a complex method and one involving many challenges. This paper critically assesses the approaches associated with conventional urban water management. The Sponge City concept and its adoption are then scrutinized to comprehensively assess the limitations and opportunities. It emerges that Sponge City has four main principles, these being: urban water resourcing, ecological water management, green infrastructures, and urban permeable pavement. The uncertainties in Sponge City design and planning, and financial insufficiencies are the most serious problems that can risk the failure of the Sponge City concept. While significant barriers exist, the opportunities for implementing a Sponge City are evident. To obtain multi-ecosystem services of Sponge City, it should be implemented at the watershed scales and be flexible, depending on different decision levels or catchment characteristics. It is essential to apply an intelligent decision-making mechanism and consider the need for close cooperation between various agencies with which the central government can work. A suitable sized and harmonious Sponge City, ensuring a good balance between socio-economic development and environmental conservation, is the ideal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through a mixed-methods narrative approach, we found that most of our respondents exhibited positive attachment to their communities, aligning with previous studies in rural settings. Using a conceptual model of place attachment (Raymond et al. 2010), the study identified five dimensions of attachment among the respondents: place identity, place dependency, family bonding, friend bonding, and nature bonding. The most dominant narratives centered around practical ties to the area through family and place dependency, combined with symbolic attachments in the form of nature and identity. Place attachment through generational ties, closeness to nature, and access to historical knowledge influenced residents' risk perception, here displayed as heightened awareness of flash flood-related risks. This risk awareness did however not translate directly into feeling at risk. Findings point to residents' underestimating risk close to home, which could partially be explained by strong place attachment. Coping behavior was mainly motivated by previous hazard experiences. Place dependency and family bonding contribute to explaining the resident's reluctancy to relocate as a coping strategy. We found that place attachment can act as both a mediator and a moderator between risk perception and coping behavior, and the relationship between place attachment, risk perception, and coping behavior is complex. While no clear causal relationship was established, understanding common elements in risk narratives can enhance community resilience and inform strategies to address community concerns.

Land-use change and climate change are now affecting forests globally, influencing seedling establishment directly via changes in light availability and precipitation and indirectly by affecting herbivory. The present study evaluated the ecological complexity of seedling establishment in response to interactions between these factors. The growth and survival of a pioneer species and two later successional species were measured in a factorial experiment testing the effects of land-use change, water availability, and herbivory. The study was conducted on Mt. Gorongosa in central Mozambique, a protected area that is experiencing high levels of land-use change and is in need of forest restoration. The pioneer species, Erythrina lysistemon, gained the most height in undisturbed, shaded environments where it invested resources in accessing light. Erythrina lysistemon grew the most in diameter in open areas. Khaya anthotheca, a later successional species, gained more biomass in disturbed, high light areas. The growth of Millettia stuhlmannii, another later successional species, was not affected by light. Drought conditions reduced survival of the later successional species, while flooding limited the survival of the pioneer species. Herbivory increased in disturbed areas and was nega-tively correlated with E. lysistemon root biomass. In summary, this study indicates land-use change and cli-mate change may alter seedling establishment and community composition. Restoration efforts should focus on increasing seedling survival because although survival is limited in disturbed sites, seedlings that do sur-vive grow successfully.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

Mainstreaming nature-based solutions: What role do Communities of Practice play in delivering a paradigm shift?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk management; Social learning; Triple -loop learning framework	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; WATER GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; COPRODUCTION; ACTORS	As the urgency to adapt to climate change intensifies, nature-based solutions (NBS) are receiving increasing attention. To mainstream NBS, a fundamental shift in environmental management is required. This study evaluates the role that Communities of Practice (CoP) can play as platforms to foster social learning to drive such a paradigm shift. A Natural Flood Management (NFM) CoP in Yorkshire, UK, was used as a case study. A unique research design combined opportunistic data collected prior to the inception of the CoP and purposive data collected during and after its formation. Opportunistic data captured information from stakeholders regarding NFM engagement and challenges around its instalment and delivery. Purposive data was used to examine the ability of a CoP to foster social learning, overcome the challenges identified prior to its establishment and evaluate the extent to which a CoP contributes to inducing a NBS paradigm shift, using a multi-loop social learning framework. Results demonstrate that the CoP was effective in delivering social learning and improving NFM instalment and delivery. While most evidence of social learning point to incremental rather than trans-formational changes, it did reveal abundant questioning of the current framing of flood management. Further-more, the CoP seems to have encouraged some participants to re-think the current governance structures for NFM and the boundaries of current actor networks, raising promise that, if sustained in the longer term, the CoP could induce a paradigm shift. Further research should conduct longitudinal studies to examine the CoP's development overtime and its potential for overcoming current constraints.

Understanding how early human coped with flooding will shed light on the increase of contemporary social resilience to projected intensified extreme climate change. However, assessment of such ancient human response to hydrological changes remains difficult due to the paucity of records for flood risk coupled with ancient human activities. Here, we present a two-millennium continuous reconstruction of water level changes for Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater body, using microbial tetraethers extracted from a well-dated sedimentary core. The rising trend of lake water level over the past 2000 years indicates an increase in flood risks for this fertile region that has long been populated by ancient human settlements. A comparison with spatial-temporal distribution of ancient cities and towns in the lake basin reveals that, during the first millennium, human settlements passively retreated outwards and upwards away from the lake to minimize flood risk due to the rising lake water. However, a reversal pattern occurred at similar to 1000 CE, witnessing human settlements to moving closer to lakeshore during the second millennium despite of the high water table. The strategic shift, accompanied by a booming economy in southern China during the Song Dynasty, was possibly facilitated by technology innovations, such as intensified water conservancy construction and enhanced shipbuilding, in and around the lake basin. Such an enhanced social resilience in responding to flood risks as early as 1000 years ago remains as a common practice today although the unprecedented scale of anthropogenic climate change in the near future may post additional and unexpected challenges.

Recovering the lost potential of meadows to help mitigate challenges facing California's forests and water supply	CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE JOURNAL			English	Article						climate change; Creek Fire; floodplain connectivity; potential operational delineation; process-based restoration; reservoir sedimentation; Sierra Nevada	SIERRA-NEVADA MOUNTAINS; SUMMER LOW FLOWS; HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES; WESTERN CASCADES; RESTORATION; CLIMATE; STORAGE; EROSION; RUNOFF; IMPACT	Groundwater systems in snow-dominated drainage areas supply cool baseflows that support instream and downstream users late into the dry season. Yet, these catchments are becoming rarer with climate change and anthropogenic pressures that threaten groundwater systems. Restoration of low-gradient meadows and streams can recover a catchment's natural storage potential, especially in Mediterranean biomes such as the Sierra Nevada of California where summer groundwater recharge is scarce. The degradation of meadows due to intense human modification has decreased groundwater elevations and shifted wet meadow plant communities toward more xeric forest and shrub communities. We applied machine learning tools to find potential "lost meadows" that may no longer support high groundwater elevations or meadow vegetation but do exhibit basic geomorphic and climatic characteristics similar to existing meadows. The model reveals potential meadow habitat in the Sierra Nevada of nearly three times its current extent. We offer two conceptual applications of the model for incorporating meadows in watershed restoration planning. The first application focuses on strategically expanding wet meadows already associated with fuel breaks for increasing wildfire resistance. The second shows how meadow restoration in post-wildfire landscapes could increase capture of sediment from burned hillslopes where increased sediment storage would benefit water storage. Meadows are important habitats that have become degraded due to long-term overuse. Re-envisioning their potential extent shows that, with restoration, meadows could also serve as components of California's multi-tiered efforts to manage pressing threats to its forests and water supply.

J	Sakijege, T; Dakyaga, F				Sakijege, Tumpale; Dakyaga, Francis			Going beyond generalisation: perspective on the persistence of urban floods in Dar es Salaam	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Review						Urban flooding; System theory; Sub-Saharan Africa; Dar es Salaam; Global south	RIVER-BASIN; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; RISK; URBANIZATION; MUMBAI	The paper discusses the persistence of floods focusing attention on the city of Dar es Salaam (DSM), where over 10% of the Tanzanian population resides. Beyond the metaphor of exploding population growth, the city has witnessed recurring floods. Whilst studies abound on the vulnerability and socio-economic losses associated with flood hazards, limited studies exist about the persistence of flood hazards in DSM. This study attempts to analyse (i) the various factors that exacerbate flooding in Dar es Salaam; and (ii) the extent of interdependency and interconnection of the various factors. A thorough systematic desk review of the literature was conducted focusing on Dar es Salaam. The literature surveyed shows how colonial planning legacy has (in)directly shaped the geomorphology of DSM, and instigated the persistence of present-day floods. Specifically, rapid spatial urbanization in informality, weak capacity in spatial development control, limited coverage of drainage infrastructure, geomorphology, climate change and variability, and low coverage of solid waste collection were discovered as the major factors exacerbating floods in DSM. Besides the interdependency and interconnected nature of these factors, the review showed how the persistence of flood hazards in Dar es Salaam is influenced by the coexistence and synergistic forces of the aforementioned: rapid spatial urbanization with informality, weak capacity in spatial development control, limited coverage of drainage infrastructure, geomorphology, climate change and variability and low coverage of solid waste collection. The study recommends that urban planners pay attention to city-specific context and the interlinked nature of the factors exacerbating floods in tailoring interventions.

Invasion windows for a global legume invader are revealed after joint examination of abiotic and biotic filters	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Demographic dynamics; disturbance; ecological novelty; environmental change; flooding; habitat filtering; pulsed resources	EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; INFLORESCENCE SIZE; NATURAL ENEMIES; RESISTANCE; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; DROUGHT; TOLERANCE	Successful alien plant invasion is influenced by both climate change and plant-plant interactions. We estimate the single and interactive effects of competition and extreme weather events on the performance of the global legume invader Lupinus polyphyllus (Lindl.). In three experimental studies we assessed (i) the stress tolerance of seedling and adult L. polyphyllus plants against extreme weather events (drought, fluctuating precipitation, late frost), (ii) the competitive effects of L. polyphyllus on native grassland species and vice versa, and (iii) the interactive effects of extreme weather events and competition on the performance of L. polyphyllus. Drought reduced growth and led to early senescence of L. polyphyllus but did not reduce adult survival. Fluctuating precipitation events and late frost reduced the length of inflorescences. Under control conditions, interspecific competition reduced photosynthetic activity and growth of L. polyphyllus. When subjected to competition during drought, L. polyphyllus conserved water while simultaneously maintaining high assimilation rates, demonstrating increased water use efficiency. Meanwhile, native species had reduced performance under drought. In summary, the invader gained an advantage under drought conditions through a smaller reduction in performance relative to its native competitors but was competitively inferior under control conditions. This provides evidence for a possible invasion window for this species. While regions of high elevation or latitude with regular severe late frost events might remain inaccessible for L. polyphyllus, further spread across Europe seems probable as the predicted increase in drought events may favour this non-native legume over native species.

J	Jones, DM; Doberstein, B				Jones, Devon M.; Doberstein, Brent			Encouraging co-benefits in climate-affected hazard adaptation: Developing and testing a scorecard for project design and evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Co-benefits; Hazard; Adaptation; Resilience; Climate change; Disaster risk reduction	RISK REDUCTION; FLOOD RISK; GREY INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CHANGE MITIGATION; HUMAN HEALTH; FRAMEWORK; RESILIENCE	Hazard risk is evolving with climate change. Many climate-affected hazards are becoming more common, more severe, and less predictable. As a result, strengthening community resilience is more important than ever. Recognizing that many factors impact vulnerability, hazard adaptation should seek to address vulnerability on all fronts. This is where co-benefits become valuable. Here, the term 'co-benefits' is defined as the secondary or unintended goals of a hazard adaptation project that are additional to the project's primary function, but complementary to its objective of increasing community resilience. Co-benefits strengthen communities both by addressing hazard impacts and by increasing their capacity to cope with risks. To encourage the integration of co-benefits into more adaptation projects, this paper presents decision-makers with a tool to systematically consider project co-benefits. A scoping literature review following best practices provided insight into the current conceptualization of co-benefits in the scholarly hazards literature. It found that co-benefits help projects cope with uncertainty, that they are most valuable in situations where hazard adaptation has to compete with other pressing needs for limited resources, and that they are most commonly achieved through green concept projects (e. g., nature-based solutions). Building on this synthesis, the co-benefits identified in this review were then used to create a co-benefits scorecard. The scorecard provides insight for project design and evaluation, giving decision-makers a systematic way to consider different kinds of co-benefits and the degree to which a project pursues those benefits.

These changes further alter the physical properties of the catchment. The combined effects of these changes on runoff are analyzed from upstream to downstream of the Yarlung-Zangpo River (YR) basin in southeastern Tibetan Plateau using statistical methods and a modified Budyko equation with consideration of glacier melting. Major results show that in the study period of 1980-2015 there was a jump in the mean annual temperature and precipitation around 1997. Since 1997, accelerated glacier melt and the thaw of permafrost have contributed to a nearly 80.9% increase in surface runoff in the upstream region of the YR basin. Meanwhile, the increase of runoff in the same period in downstream areas of the basin with warm and wet climates is smaller and has been mostly from an increase in annual precipitation. Part of that increase is offset by changes in catchment properties following the warming, such as the increase in vegetation coverage. Results of runoff responses to climate change and catchment properties across different sub-basins in the YR basin and between the two time periods separated in 1997 suggest that continued warming would reduce the buffering effect of glacial and permafrost on runoff in upstream areas of the basin, shortening the runoff response time to precipitation and increasing flood and drought vulnerability of the YR basin.

Unfortunately, aquatic ecosystems in the country are under serious threat and conditions are deteriorating. In 2018-19, the government of Ecuador sponsored a series of workshops to examine the conservation status of Ecuador's freshwater fishes. Concerns were identified for 35 species, most of which are native to the Amazon region, and overfishing of Amazonian pimelodid catfishes emerged as a major issue. However, much of the information needed to make decisions across fish groups and regions was not available, hindering the process and highlighting the need for a review of the conservation threats to Ecuador's freshwater fishes. Here, we review how the physical alteration of rivers, deforestation, wetland and floodplain degradation, agricultural and urban water pollution, mining, oil extraction, dams, overfishing, introduced species and climate change are affecting freshwater fishes in Ecuador. Although many of these factors affect fishes throughout the Neotropics, the lack of data on Ecuadorian fish communities is staggering and highlights the urgent need for more research. We also make recommendations, including the need for proper enforcement of existing environmental laws, restoration of degraded aquatic ecosystems, establishment of a national monitoring system for freshwater ecosystems, investment in research to fill gaps in knowledge, and encouragement of public engagement in citizen science and conservation efforts. Freshwater fishes are an important component of the cultural and biological legacy of the Ecuadorian people. Conserving them for future generations is critical.

This article examines how the Kashechewan First Nation, located in the flood-prone Subarctic southwestern James Bay region of Canada, is affected by the frequent risk of spring flooding. Kashechewan, an isolated and remote Indigenous community, is located along the Albany River in northern Ontario. Kashechewan First Nation has been evacuated 14 times to at least 22 host communities across Ontario since 2004 (consecutively from 2004 to 2008 and 2012-2019) because of actual flooding events or flooding risk and the potential failure of the dike that surrounds the community. Through a collaboration with the First Nation, qualitative semi-structured interviews were completed with 41 participants. Results show that spring flood risk has significantly increased the community's physical and socio-cognitive vulnerability. Flooding frequently impacts community infrastructure, traditional spring hunting and harvesting, and the local economy. It also significantly increases the stress and anxiety of residents every year as spring approaches. Dealing with the regular flooding risk and recurring emergency experiences have improved the community's disaster preparedness and coping capacity, but residents' evacuation experiences negatively affect their well-being during and after the evacuations. The short-term responses to the physical vulnerability of people frequently experiencing the elevated hazards risks help increasing specific resilience-building and coping capacity in the short-run. However, such short-term responses can also produce greater vulnerability in the long-term. Similarly, if the long-term adaptation responses for resilience-building do not consider the short-term coping capacities and community-specific ground realities, they can significantly increase the physical vulnerability of residents.

Delayed mixing of iron-laden tributaries in large boreal rivers: Implications for iron transport, water quality and monitoring	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Athabasca River; Climate Change; Colloids; Field-flow fractionation; Large River Confluences; Trace elements	OIL SANDS REGION; TRACE-ELEMENTS; ATHABASCA RIVER; COLLOIDS; MATTER; CARBON; COAGULATION; GROUNDWATER; DEPOSITION; FRACTION	Boreal river systems globally provide specialized habitats and conduits for the transfer of nutrients, iron and trace elements (TEs) from wetlands and groundwaters to lakes and oceans. Many large boreal rivers are also the site of controversy due to their dual purpose providing ecosystem services for Indigenous peoples and supporting industrial activity; however, water quality monitoring in these systems is more complex than realized. This work demonstrates the impacts of delayed tributary mixing in a typical large boreal river on the properties and transport of Fe-bearing colloids, and water quality monitoring, in two subsequent autumns. The forms and concentrations of Fe colloids were conserved through the mixing zone for more than 100 km, despite salinity changes. Delayed mixing for ca. 60-80 and more than 100 km led to TE concentration differences of more than five-fold across the river. Using traditional samples from the middle of the river, the coincidence of mixing zones with areas of potential industrial impact obscured the potential contributions of some TEs, and caused the erroneous attribution of other TEs to industry at concentrations that were double upstream values. Adequate water quality monitoring and source attribution in large boreal rivers thus requires high-resolution spatial sampling, both across the river and upstream-downstream of potential natural and industrial sources. Since mixing behavior and water quality in large boreal rivers are highly sensitive to hydrologic changes such as seasonal fluctuations, drought/floods, and climate change, fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render traditional monitoring approaches unsuitable.

Changes in North Atlantic Atmospheric Circulation in a Warmer Climate Favor Winter Flooding and Summer Drought over Europe	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						North Atlantic Ocean; Atmospheric circulation; Climate change; Climate classification; regimes; General circulation models; Europe; Teleconnections	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; WEATHER REGIMES; JET-STREAM; HEMISPHERE WINTER; SYNOPTIC PATTERNS; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; OCEAN; BLOCKING; MODELS	Changes in atmospheric circulation under increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are important because of their implications for weather extremes and associated societal risks. However, uncertainties in models and future projections are still large and drivers behind circulation changes are not well understood. Particularly for Europe, a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is considered important as it affects SST patterns and ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and, subsequently, European climate. Here we detect and characterize changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Atlantic under increasing CO2 concentrations in simulations of a very high-resolution, fully coupled climate model (CM2.6) with a realistic representation of the AMOC. We use an objective clustering technique (self-organizing maps) and validate the model's clusters against reanalysis data. We compare the frequency of those patterns in a CO2 doubling experiment, characterized by an AMOC decline, with those in a preindustrial run, and find statistically significant changes. The most robust findings are 1) a similar to 30% increase in zonal flow regimes in February, relevant for flood risk in northwestern Europe, and 2) a similar to 60% increase in anticyclonic (high pressure) circulation directly west of the United Kingdom in August, relevant for western and central European drought. A robust decrease in the frequency of Scandinavian blocking is also seen across most months and seasons. Despite the uncertainties regarding atmospheric circulation response to climate change, our findings contribute to the increasing evidence for the emergence of robust high-impact changes over Europe.

A Robust Method to Update Local River Inundation Maps Using Global Climate Model Output and Weather Typing Based Statistical Downscaling	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Extreme floods; Weather types; Rainfall variability; Climate change; Statistical downscaling	DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; CIRCULATION; IMPACT; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; REGIME; LINKS	Global warming is changing the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events. This requires updating local rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and flood hazard maps according to the future climate scenarios. This is, however, far from straightforward, given our limited ability to model the effects of climate change on the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall at small scales. In this study, we develop a robust method to update local IDF relations for sub-daily rainfall extremes using Global Climate Model (GCM) data, and we apply it to a coastal town in NW Spain. First, the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation, described by means of Lamb Circulation Type classification (LCT), and rainfall events with potential for flood generation is analyzed. A broad ensemble set of GCM runs is used to identify frequency changes in LCTs, and to assess the occurrence of flood generating events in the future. In a parallel way, we use this Weather Type (WT) classification and climate-flood linkages to downscale rainfall from GCMs, and to determine the IDF curves for the future climate scenarios. A hydrological-hydraulic modeling chain is then used to quantify the changes in flood maps induced by the IDF changes. The results point to a future increase in rainfall intensity for all rainfall durations, which consequently results in an increased flood hazard in the urban area. While acknowledging the uncertainty in the GCM projections, the results show the need to update IDF standards and flood hazard maps to reflect potential changes in future extreme rainfall intensities.

Investigating mass balance of Parvati glacier in Himalaya using satellite imagery based model	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WESTERN HIMALAYA; CHANDRA BASIN; BEAS BASIN; REGION; ACCUMULATION; DYNAMICS; SNOWLINE; DECADES; RETREAT; INDEX	Accurate assessment of glacier mass loss is essential for understanding the glacier sensitivity to climate change and the ramifications of glacier retreat or surge. The glacier melt affects the runoff and water availability, on which the drinking and irrigation water supplies and generation of hydroelectric energy depend upon. The excessive glacial retreat may cause flood, glacial lake outburst flood, avalanches and sea level rise which are likely to affect the lives and livelihood of the people and damage the infrastructure. Here, we present a remote sensing based modeling framework to improve the understanding of accumulation and ablation processes and to quantify the glacier mass balance using multispectral satellite imageries, as several glacierized regions of the world are still poorly monitored because the field measurements for continuous monitoring on a large scale or in a complex harsh terrain are costly, time consuming and difficult. The developed modeling framework has been applied to the Parvati glacier in the western Himalaya to investigate glaciological processes and estimate the surface mass loss using 19 years of satellite images from 1998 to 2016. It spreads over 425.318 km(2) and more than 50% of the area is accumulation area. The study shows that the Parvati glacier is not in equilibrium and its behavioural response changes year to year characterized with high rate of mass loss. The value of accumulation area ratio varies between 0.33 and 0.70 with an average value of 0.55, indicating a negative mass loss. The mean specific mass loss is -0.49 +/- 0.11 m w.e. and the total mass loss is 3.95 Gt., indicating strong influence of climate change and effect on river flows and water availability.

This involved 209 farmers that were selected through a multistage sampling procedure in the Northern region of Ghana. The data was analysed using double hurdle and ordered probit regressions. From the result, the study established that most of the farmers were willing-to-insure their farms and were willing-to-pay a positive price for farm insurance. The decision to insure farm was significantly influenced by education, farmer group membership and floods. On the other hand, farmer group membership, remitters, windstorm, climate perception and location in a rich class district, extension access, commercial production, floods, drought and off-farm diversification significantly influenced the premium farmers were willing to pay. It is concluded that most of the farmers recover faster from climate shocks as nearly all the farmers indicated an ability to recover from climate shocks with shorter time periods. Generally, the factors that had significant effect on the recovery period of the farmers were age, education, number of children, access to extension service, contract farming, farmer group membership, farm size, sex, number of household adults, access to credit and farm insurance. Therefore, farm insurance is an important strategy of making farming households recover faster from climate shocks. As such, there is the need to introduce farm insurance policies to crop farmers in the region at an agreed price between farmers and insurance providers.

Agriculture is the most affected sector as 95% of cultivated area is rainfed. This review addressed trends in moisture stress and the impacts on crop production, highlighting adaptation possible strategies to ensure food security in southern Africa. Notable changes in rainfall patterns and deficiencies in soil moisture are estimated and discussed, as well as the impact of rainfall variability on crop production and proposed adaptation strategies in agriculture. Climate moisture index (CMI) was used to assess aridity levels. Southern Africa is described as a climate hotspot due to increasing aridity, low adaptive capacity, underdevelopment and marginalisation. Although crop yields have been increasing due to increases in irrigated area and use of improved seed varieties, they have not been able to meet the food requirements of a growing population, compromising regional food security targets. Most countries in the region depend on international aid to supplement yield deficits. The recurrence of droughts caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) continue devastating the region, affecting livelihoods, economies and the environment. An example is the 2015/2016 ENSO drought that caused the region to call for international aid to feed about 40 million people. In spite of the water scarcity challenges, cereal production continues to increase steadily due to increased investment in irrigated agriculture and improved crop varieties. Given the current and future vulnerability of the agriculture sector in southern Africa, proactive adaptation interventions are important to help farming communities develop resilient systems to adapt to the changes and variability in climate and other stressors.

Feeding this future world requires scientifically informed innovations in agriculture. Here, we describe how a rice gene conferring tolerance to prolonged submergence has helped farmers in South and Southeast Asia mitigate rice crop failure during floods. We discuss how planting of this new variety benefited socially disadvantaged groups. This example indicates that investment in agricultural improvement can protect farmers from risks associated with a changing climate.

About 4.43 million people living in the Indian Sundarbans face a lack of freshwater availability due to the erratic behaviour of monsoon rains, frequent cyclonic storms, intrusion of saline water, and other factors, all of which affect the fisheries and agriculture activities of this area. In this study, estimates of freshwater availability through past and predicted future rainfall and evapotranspiration change scenarios in the Sundarbans are presented. Due to the lack of high-quality in-situ data, various sources of gridded rainfall and evapotranspiration data were used. Between 1948 and 2010, half of the 19 administrative blocks showed a decreasing trend of monsoonal rainfall while the rest showed an increasing trend. Freshwater availability showed a decreasing trend during the monsoon season over different blocks of the Sundarbans, which is a matter of great concern for fisheries and agricultural activities. Statistical downscaling was used to generate future rainfall and evapotranspiration scenarios, using coarse resolution Global Climate Models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase five for a smaller area like the Sundarbans. Downscaled Global Climate Models project an increasing trend in future monsoon rainfall in both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The increasing rainfall can trigger excessive run-off and flooding, which would in turn affect aquaculture infrastructure and damage lentic aquaculture productions across the Sundarbans. However, increased rainfall may expand the flood plain area and extend the feeding grounds of fish. Hence, the impact of rainfall change is quite unpredictable. Proper adaptation techniques may be required to harness the positive impacts while preventing negative effects.

Accurate assessment of coastal flood risk is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation under changing environment. The objective of the study is to propose an integrated framework for future flood risk assessment by Bayesian-based time-varying model and expected annual damage (EAD) in the coastal city. To decrease the uncertainty of non-stationary frequency, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and time-varying parameter distri-bution (TVPD) models were employed to establish the non-stationary distributions of rainfall and tides, and copula function was adopted to determine the joint and co-occurrence probability. Subsequently, to reflect flooding probability and inundation damage simultaneously, the EAD was applied to quantify flood risk by copula function and hydrodynamic model. The variation and uncertainty of flood risk were also investigated under changing environment. Taking Haidian Island in Hainan Province, China as a case study, the results show that the non-stationary distributions of rainfall and tides can be appropriately derived based on BMA and TVPD models. The joint and co-occurrence probabilities increase significantly under non-stationary scenario with the average rates of 33.22 % and 64.82 %, respectively. Moreover, the EAD will be underestimated by 20.56 %- 69.84 % in 2030-2060 year without considering non-stationarity, and the uncertainty of EAD rises with the increase of the design year. The approach and result of our study can help decision makers evaluate the future flood risk in the coastal city, and provide support for sustainable flood management to adapt the climate change.

For this purpose, sub-daily river discharge for the entire Italian territory was simulated with the CETEMPS hydrological model (CHyM) using as climate forcing both observational datasets and regional climate simulations completed with the ICTP Regional Climate Model (RegCM4). First, simulated precipitation and river discharge were evaluated against observational products, showing both models good performance in simulating Italian precipitation and discharge characteristics. Then, projections of these variables were explored for two time slices, near (2020-2049) and far (2070-2099) future, under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, with RegCM4 driven by output from a global climate model projection. The RegCM4 outputs were also bias-adjusted by means of the N-dimension multivariate bias correction (MBCn) method. We found that, although the bias correction leads to a benefit in capturing mean precipitation, the improvement is less clear for extreme precipitation. In terms of discharge, however, bias correction has a noticeable impact on mean discharge as well as average yearly peak flow and hourly peak flow at return periods of 10, 50, and 100 years. Nevertheless, for a large part of the Italian territory, projected changes in mean precipitation and discharge do not show significant differences when bias correction is applied, while for extreme events only similar to 30 % of river points show significant sensitivity to bias correction. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, an increase in yearly peak flow is evident over most of the Italian peninsula, with values increasing from 30 % to more than 100 % for the mid and far time slices respectively, especially over the Po River and along the eastern coasts of Italy. Similar conclusions are found for the hourly peak flows of 10, 50, and 100-year return periods. These indicators thus suggest a general increase in flood hazard expected over the region.

The Suwannee River Estuary of Florida's Big Bend Coastline has historically been a productive and diverse estuarine ecosystem supported by significant freshwater inputs from the Suwannee River. In recent years, significant changes in land use and climatic conditions have resulted in lower discharges from the Suwannee. Our objectives were to explore the impact of freshwater inputs from the Suwannee River on the estuarine forage fish and sportfish communities downstream. We built a trophic-dynamic food web model in Ecopath with Ecosim to simulate different levels of discharge and evaluate how changes in discharge (drought and floods) would influence the trophic structure of the food web. Using the fitted model, we applied a series of different short-term and long-term flow projections under different climatic scenarios to evaluate impacts on fish functional groups and sportfish biomass. Simulations suggested that ecological production was more influenced by drought conditions than flood conditions. In our short-term scenarios, the drought simulations produced biomass changes that were approximately twice as substantial as the flood scenarios. When making comparisons to other published EwE models, we generally observed smaller changes in biomass production. Although this model focused on the influence of bottom-up effects, we observed strong top-down control of snook (Centropomus undecimalis) on the system. Several functional groups were particularly sensitive to changes in snook abundance which included spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), sand seatrout (C. arenarius), and other members of the family Sciaenidae. Because snook have recently colonized the estuary, likely as a result of warmer winter temperatures, this finding has implications for climate change and natural resource management.

Planned relocation is considered a last resort as a form of adaptation to the impacts of climatic and environmental change. The health impacts of planned relocation are poorly understood. This paper draws on data from multi-year research with residents of the iTaukei (Indigenous) Fijian village of Vunidogoloa. We used qualitative research methods to examine experiences of planned relocation, including residents' accounts of their health and quality of life. In-depth interviews and group discussions were conducted with villagers living in a site of relocation, at four points in time (2015, 2016, 2019, and 2020). Twenty-seven people in Vunidogoloa, Fiji, participated in in-depth interviews, several on more than one occasion. Six group discussions with between eight to twelve participants were also conducted. Qualitative analytic software (NVivo) was used to analyse interview transcripts and identify themes. Villagers report both health benefits and challenges following planned relocation. Key facilitators for good health include movement away from some environmental risks to health, adequate drinking water and sanitation, food security including through farms and kitchen gardens, livelihood opportunities, improved access to schools and health services, and appropriate housing design. However, residents also refer to unanticipated risks to health including increased consumption of packaged goods and alcohol, disruptions to social structures and traditional values, and disrupted place attachment following movement away from a coastal site of belonging with consequences for mental wellbeing. Therefore, planned relocation has altered the social determinants of health in complex ways, bringing both health opportunities and risks. These results highlight the need for context-specific planning and adaptation programs that include meaningful involvement of community members in ongoing decision making, and call for an understanding of diverse social determinants of health that emerge and evolve in contexts of planned relocation.

J	Seddighi, H; Seddighi, S				Seddighi, Hamed; Seddighi, Sadegh			How much the Iranian government spent on disasters in the last 100 years? A critical policy analysis	COST EFFECTIVENESS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION			English	Article						Policy analysis; Budgeting; Disasters; Resources allocation; Climate change	BILLION-DOLLAR WEATHER; EARTHQUAKE; DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; RUPTURE; COST; RISK; GIS	Background During the past 20 years, Iran has been experiencing a significant increase in the occurrence of disasters mainly due to the emergence of anthropogenic climate change. This paper aims at analyzing the trend of national budget allocation in Iran over the last 100 years to evaluate the focus of the Iranian state on the four phases of Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery and propose modifications. Methods It is used a critical policy analysis with what's the problem represented approach. In this approach is focused on problematization and policy gaps. The most important policy statement in any government is the budget. During the first screening, 1028 regulations and laws were found from 1910 to 2020. After full text screening, 494 regulations and laws related to budget allocation to disasters were analyzed. Results The Iranian government has spent around 29 billion USD on disasters during the last 100 years. Droughts, earthquake and flood have costs the government more than other disasters, accounting for more than 14, 6.9, and 6.1 billion USD, respectively, in the allocated budget. Most of the Iranian government expenditure during the last 100 years on various disasters such as drought, flood, earthquake, and COVID-19 has been spent on involuntary costs including Response and Recovery. Mitigation and Preparedness are the two critical disaster management phases with very small shares of national budgeting. Conclusions From policy audit and policy gaps it is concluded that Iranian governments during last 100 years, problematized the issue of "disasters strike" and not "disasters' risks". In time of disasters, governments tried to solve the issues or impacts of disasters with budgeting to response and recovery.

Enhancing climate resilience of vertical seawall with retrofitting - A physical modelling study	APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH			English	Article						Overtopping discharge; Wave-by-wave overtopping volume; Coastal resilience; Retrofitting seawalls; Recurve wall; Climate change adaptation; Coastal flooding	WAVE LOADS; PROTECTION; VEGETATION	Coastal defence structures are playing a vital role in protecting coastal communities from extreme climatic conditions and flooding. With climate change and sea-level rise in the next decades, the freeboard of existing coastal defences is likely to be reduced and the probability of wave overtopping for these coastal defences will increase. The wave overtopping from coastal defences increases the probability of coastal inundation and flooding, imposing threat to the communities which are living in low-lying coastal areas. Retrofitting of existing seawalls offers the potential to enhance coastal resilience by allowing them to adapt and respond to changing climatic conditions. This study investigates a range of possible physical configurations and optimum retrofit geometry to maximize the protection of existing seawalls from wave overtopping. A comprehensive physical modelling study of four retrofit prototypes, including recurve wall, model vegetation, reef breakwater and diffraction pillars, was conducted to examine their performance in mitigating wave overtopping, when placed in front of a vertical seawall. All the tests were conducted on 1:20 smooth beach slope. Each test case consisted of approximately 1000 pseudo-random waves based on the JONSWAP spectrum. The physical modelling experiments were designed to include both impulsive and non-impulsive wave conditions. This study provides new predictive relations and decision support tool needed to evaluate overtopping risks from existing seawalls with retrofits under various hydrodynamic conditions. The analysis of experimental measurements demonstrates that wave overtopping from retrofitting structures can be predicted with similar relations for vertical seawalls, and by using a reduction factor which varies with geometric shapes. Statistical measures and sensitivity analysis show that recurve walls have the best performance in reduction of wave overtopping volume followed by model vegetation and reef breakwater. The measurements show the insignificance of diffraction pillars, at least for the selected configurations investigated, in mitigating wave overtopping.

This intensification will increase the risk of floods, soil erosion, and droughts in the world's dry regions. Exploring the precipitation's irregularity and the daily precipitation concentration in Central Asia (CA) has significant implications for regional agricultural development and ecosystem services. However, the irregularity of precipitation was poorly understood throughout the entire CA due to the sparse meteorological observations. Using the daily Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP-V2.2) from 1979 to 2016 across CA, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of the daily precipitation concentration index (CI) and the precipitation diversity and analyzed their attributes and implications. The results demonstrated that the CI was significantly negatively correlated with the precipitation frequency and amount. The distribution of the precipitation frequency diversity (H-fre) and the precipitation amount diversity (H-amount) showed an opposite pattern with the CI, implying that the low H-fre and H-amount values were corresponding to a high precipitation concentration. The high CI values were found in the Tarim Basin and near the Aral Sea, revealing a strong irregularity in precipitation. The decrease regarding the light precipitation frequency or increase in the torrential precipitation frequency generated the increasing precipitation frequency diversity, corresponding to a wide-spread significant reduction of the CI in CA. The decreased CI and increased precipitation diversity over past decades were likely related to the warming phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The shift from light to extreme precipitation will trigger the risk of flooding and soil erosion and bring about big challenges for water resources management in the arid and semi-arid regions.

Fluvial activity in major river basins of the eastern United States during the Holocene	HOLOCENE			English	Article						climate change; eastern United States; flooding; fluvial sediments; Holocene; meta-analysis; radiocarbon; rivers	ATLANTIC COASTAL-PLAIN; BLUE-RIDGE MOUNTAINS; LOWER OHIO RIVER; LATE PLEISTOCENE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALLUVIAL STRATIGRAPHY; NORTH-CAROLINA; WEST-VIRGINIA; MID-HOLOCENE; ICE-AGE	In the eastern United States, existing paleo-reconstructions in fluvial environments consist primarily of site-specific investigations of climate and human impacts on riverine processes. This paper presents the first meta-analysis of fluvial reconstructions focused on regional watersheds of the eastern United States, including the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee, South Atlantic-Gulf Coast, Ohio, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regional watersheds. Chronologies of fluvial activity (i.e. alluvial deposition) and stability (i.e. landscape stability) were developed by synthesizing data from existing, published, and site-specific fluvial reconstruction studies conducted across the eastern United States. Overall, regional watersheds show variable patterns of synchronicity across watersheds and did not demonstrate cyclic behavior through the Holocene. During the last millennium, only the Lower Mississippi and Ohio regional watersheds exhibit high rates of fluvial activity active during the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' (650-1050 yr BP), while nearly all other regional watersheds in the eastern United States were active during the 'Little Ice Age' (100-500 yr BP). These findings imply that fluvial activity may be more spatially restricted during warmer/drier climatic conditions than during cooler/wetter periods. We find an increase in fluvial activity during the era of Euro-American colonization (400 yr BP to present) in the southeastern United States but not the northeastern United States, implying a heterogeneous response of fluvial systems to human activities in the eastern United States related to climatic, cultural, and/or physiographic variability. These new insights gained from fluvial chronologies in the eastern United States demonstrate the utility of regionally synthesized paleo-records to understand large-scale climate variation effect on rivers.

A risk-based analytical framework for quantifying non-stationary flood risks and establishing infrastructure design standards in a changing environment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Non-stationary hydrologic extremes; Non-stationary Monte Carlo; Risk of failure of hydrologic infrastructure; Design standards for hydrologic infrastructure; Total expected lifecycle costs of infrastructure; Climate change impacts on hydrologic design	21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGIC EXTREMES; RETURN PERIOD; GREAT-LAKES; WATER; MODEL; STATIONARITY; TRENDS; RELIABILITY; EVENTS	In a rapidly changing environment, analysis of risks associated with non-stationary hydroclimatic extremes has many important implications for resilient and sustainable water resources management, including the evaluation of risk for existing systems and the design of new infrastructure. This study develops a new risk-based analytical framework called the Non-Stationary Monte-Carlo (NSMC) to better address various problems associated with non-stationarity of hydrologic extremes. Current approaches in the literature evaluating non-stationary Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of extremes events commonly use trend extension or multivariate analysis based on observed data, which often fail to account for larger changes in the future. To avoid these problems, NSMC explicitly accounts for the projected changes in hydroclimatic extremes by analyzing the changing PDFs of extremes for each future year based on statistically downscaled climate projections and hydrologic simulations. Using Monte Carlo techniques, NSMC generates a Super Ensemble (SE) of extremes, the statistics of which can be readily applied to various problems in non-stationary flood frequency analysis. For example, we show that the estimation of design standards based on Design Life Level (DLL) or Average Risk of Failure (ARF) metrics can be reduced to a simple look-up process of quantiles in the SE of extremes. A case study analyzing extreme high streamflow and a hypothetical levee design for the Wabash basin (IN, USA) demonstrates the applicability of NSMC to real-world flood risk problems. Furthermore, this study also shows an example case of using NSMC to identify cost-effective design standards for new infrastructure combining future changing risk of failure, project design lifespan, and present value of future replacement costs.

Following these changes, climate extremes-the rare events that reside in the tail of the distribution of essential climate variables-are expected to be further intensified, more frequent, and prolonged. Changes in extremes would vary spatially from region to region and thus need regional assessment for future adaptation planning. This study assesses the climate extremes at 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 4 degrees C of global warming over Bangladesh which is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Future changes in climate extremes are assessed using a subset of extreme temperature and precipitation indices devised by Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Projections from high-resolution regional climate model ensembles are used to derive extreme climate indices. Our analysis shows overall upward changes in warm indices and downward changes in cold indices at higher specific warming levels. We found a much higher increase in extreme rainfall compared with the annual total rainfall. Increasing variability of rainfall indices is found at higher specific warming levels. Our analysis also suggests a higher increase of temperature during the winter and post-monsoon seasons, as well as an increase in the 1-day and 5-day maximum rainfall during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. A significant regional difference is found in almost all the rainfall indices. The forecasted increase of extreme rainfall and consecutive dry days (CDD) over the northeast region indicates a possibility of an increase of flash floods in the future. Moreover, the increase in the extreme rainfall over the southeast region will increase the chances of landslides.	[Khan, Md Jamal Uddin; Islam, A. K. M. Saiful; Bala, Sujit Kumar; Islam, G. M.

In this study, maximum precipitation and maximum temperature indices were derived for Isfahan province, in central Iran, over the historical (1992-2017) and future (2020-2100) periods. Precipitation and maximum temperature data from the REMO model under RCP4.5 scenario were used to investigate changes in extreme values over the future period. The results showed that extreme precipitation in the historical and future periods has respectively a decreasing and increasing trend. Based on the extreme indices, temperature in the study area has a significant increasing trend in the baseline and future period. Various combinations of extreme precipitation indicators were created for joint modeling by copula theory. Copula modeling for the three weather stations for which REMO had satisfactory performance in simulating extremes over the historic period showed that the average return period of extreme precipitation combinations will be reduced in the future period compared to the historical period at Daran and Shahreza, while the average return period of combinations will have both increasing and decreasing trends at Naeen. Recommendations for Resource Managers Knowing information about the probability of occurrence of extreme precipitation with a certain value that exceeds a certain threshold will help planning for water resource systems under drought conditions and future increasing temperature. The joint return period of extreme precipitation can help to know the return period of extreme events such as floods and droughts. The findings of this study are important to assess the prediction of climate extreme. Also, these results can be useful to provide the appropriate strategies for water resources managers in drought conditions under future increasing temperature.

The aragonite-detritus laminae couplets comprising the lacustrine formations that were deposited in the Dead Sea are considered as faithful monitors of the freshwater supply to the lakes. We count a total of -5600 laminae couplets deposited in the last 45 kyr (MIS3-MIS1) at the Dead Sea center, which encompass the upper 142 m of the ICDP Core 5017-1. The present study shows that aragonite and detritus laminae are thinner and occur at high frequency during MIS 3-2, while they are much thicker and less frequent during MIS 1. By analyzing multiple climateconnected factors, we propose that significant lake-level drops, enhanced dust input, and low vegetative cover in the drainage basin during the last deglaciation (22-11.6 ka) have considerably increased erodible materials in the Dead Sea watershed. We find a decoupling existed between the significant lakelevel drop/lake size reduction and lamina thickness change during the last deglaciation. We argue that during the Last Glacial and the Holocene, the variation of lamina thickness at the multiple-millennium scale was not controlled directly by the lake-level/size change. We interpret this decoupling implying the transport capacity of flash-floods is low and might be saturated by the oversupply of erodible materials, and indicating a transport-limited regime during the time period. We suggest the observed thickness and frequency distribution of aragonite-detritus laminae points to the high frequency of small magnitude floods during the Last Glacial, in contrast to low frequency, but large -magnitude floods during the Holocene.

Gendered vulnerability and its implications for people's ability to cope with and adapt to climatic stressors was investigated in four poor rural communities in Dimla, Kaunia, Hatibandha, and Patgram upazilas (sub-districts) in Rangpur division in the lower Teesta basin area in northwest Bangladesh. These areas are strongly affected by seasonal floods, flash floods, river bank erosion, and drought throughout the year. Socioeconomic stressors coupled with these climatic stressors lead to a high level of gendered vulnerability among the villagers, which is likely to be exacerbated in extreme climatic situations. Asymmetrical gender divisions make women disproportionately vulnerable and decrease their coping and adaptive capacity in changed situations. The study showed that women are the most vulnerable amongst vulnerable groups, not simply as a result of their gender roles and responsibilities, but more as a result of discriminatory social norms and practices such as lack of property ownership, lack of education, early marriage, the dowry system, and acceptance of domestic violence against women, which further create barriers to women's mobility and economic empowerment. Women are conditioned to remain at home and not participate, or to wait for men to accompany them to most activities taking place in the public space. Although significant numbers of women have been engaging in income generating activities, creating cooperative funds, and saving money, this is still within the confines of their private space. Government policy to empower women through free education is partly effective but the dominant patriarchal practice of early marriage and dowry discourage women from coming forward. The study concludes that the prevalent gender discriminatory norms and practices must be addressed to achieve gender transformative change, which is an essential requirement for gender equity and inclusive social development. Government policies and programs should be revised to address women's practical and strategic needs for gender transformative change.

J	Lomborg, B				Lomborg, Bjorn			Welfare in the 21st century: Increasing development, reducing inequality, the impact of climate change, and the cost of climate policies	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article							SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; TROPICAL CYCLONES; INCOME INEQUALITY; HURRICANE DAMAGES; ECONOMIC DAMAGE; LAND SUBSIDENCE; GLOBAL POVERTY; FIRE HISTORY; CARBON	Climate change is real and its impacts are mostly negative, but common portrayals of devastation are unfounded. Scenarios set out under the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) show human welfare will likely increase to 450% of today's welfare over the 21st century. Climate damages will reduce this welfare increase to 434%. Arguments for devastation typically claim that extreme weather (like droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes) is already worsening because of climate change. This is mostly misleading and inconsistent with the IPCC literature. For instance, the IPCC finds no trend for global hurricane frequency and has low confidence in attribution of changes to human activity, while the US has not seen an increase in landfalling hurricanes since 1900. Global death risk from extreme weather has declined 99% over 100 years and global costs have declined 26% over the last 28 years. Arguments for devastation typically ignore adaptation, which will reduce vulnerability dramatically. While climate research suggests that fewer but stronger future hurricanes will increase damages, this effect will be countered by richer and more resilient societies. Global cost of hurricanes will likely decline from 0.04% of GDP today to 0.02% in 2100. Climate-economic research shows that the total cost from untreated climate change is negative but moderate, likely equivalent to a 3.6% reduction in total GDP. Climate policies also have costs that often vastly outweigh their climate benefits. The Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will cost $819-$1,890 billion per year in 2030, yet will reduce emissions by just 1% of what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Each dollar spent on Paris will likely produce climate benefits worth 11 cent. Long-term impacts of climate policy can cost even more. The IPCC's two best future scenarios are the "sustainable" SSP1 and the "fossil-fuel driven" SSP5. Current climate-focused attitudes suggest we aim for the "sustainable" world, but the higher economic growth in SSP5 actually leads to much greater welfare for humanity. After adjusting for climate damages, SSP5 will on average leave grandchildren of today's poor $48,000 better off every year. It will reduce poverty by 26 million each year until 2050, inequality will be lower, and more than 80 million premature deaths will be avoided. Using carbon taxes, an optimal realistic climate policy can aggressively reduce emissions and reduce the global temperature increase from 4.1 degrees C in 2100 to 3.75 degrees C. This will cost $18 trillion, but deliver climate benefits worth twice that. The popular 2 degrees C target, in contrast, is unrealistic and would leave the world more than $250 trillion worse off. The most effective climate policy is increasing investment in green R&D to make future decarbonization much cheaper. This can deliver $11 of climate benefits for each dollar spent. More effective climate policies can help the world do better. The current climate discourse leads to wasteful climate policies, diverting attention and funds from more effective ways to improve the world.

The possible feedback to a national real-time risk knowledge base during extreme events (flooding and drought) is also discussed. Under climate change conditions, Denmark is likely to experience more rain in winter, more evapotranspiration in summer, intensified cloudbursts, drought, and sea level rise. These challenges were addressed as part of the Joint Governmental Digitalization Strategy 2016-2020 for better use and sharing of public data about the terrain, water, and climate to support climate adaptation, water management, and disaster risk reduction. This initiative included the development of a new web-based data portal (HIP portal) developed by the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Infrastructure (SDFI). GEUS delivered 5 terabytes of hydrological model data to the portal, with robust calibration methods and hybrid machine learning (ML) being key parts of the deliverables. This paper discusses the challenges and potentials of further developing the HIP digital twin with 'plug-in digital twins' for local river basins, including feedback to the national level.

Consequently, it is unclear whether, and if so how, long-term climate changes affect the magnitude/frequency of sediment density flows. One approach to answering this question is to analyze a comprehensive geological record that comprises deposits that can be reliably linked to modern sediment flow processes. To address this question, we investigated the unique ICDP Core 5017-1 from the Dead Sea (the largest and deepest hypersaline lake on the Earth) depocenter covering MIS 7-1. Based on an understanding of modern sediment density flow processes in the lake, we link homogeneous muds in the core to overflows (surface flood plumes, rho(flow)<rho(water)), and link graded turbidites and debrites to underflows (rho(flow)>rho(water)). Our dataset reveals (1) overflows are more prominent during interglacials, while underflows are more prominent during glacials; (2) orbital-scale climate changes affected the flow magnitude/frequency via changing salinity and density profile of lake brine, lake-level, and source materials.

Breeding forages with climate resiliency in temperate/tropical transition zones	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; forage breeding; pest resistance; recurrent selection	ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES; PHENOTYPIC TRAITS; WHITE CLOVER; RED-CLOVER; REGISTRATION; TOLERANCE; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; SELECTION	As the earth's climate changes, the ability of breeders to select for traits within forage species that impart adaptability to these changes will be critical for the maintenance of grassland agricultural systems. Temperate - tropical climate transition zones (between 27 and 31 degrees N and S latitude) have proven to be ideal zones for breeding species with variable climate adaptation. Programs located in these regions have the advantage of exposure to alternating extreme warm and cold temperatures, drought and flood conditions, and a multitude of biotic pests including fungi, viruses, insects and nematodes. In this paper we will present examples of how forage breeding programs in north-central Florida have capitalized on these distinct advantages for selection of cultivars with resiliency to changing climate variables. Breeding programs in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) will be discussed as examples for moving cool season species into warmer climates. Species attributes that contribute to climate resiliency will be identified and described. The ability to identify small changes in genetic photoperiod responses in these regions, are illustrated as an advantage when the objective is development of earlier or later maturity. Transition zones also provide suitable environments for biotic stresses, from both tropical and temperate areas, including fungal diseases, nematodes, and insects, offering desirable field environments for screening and genetic improvement.

Floods are one of the major natural disasters in China, and they occur with high frequency and wide impact in the country, causing serious losses. Since the 1990s, they have become more frequent. China has made remarkable achievements in flood risk management, but the problems and challenges of this in the context of climate change and urbanization are still serious and require in-depth analysis and targeted adaptations. During the summer of 2020, southern China suffered from catastrophic flooding; however, the losses from this flooding were much lower than those of previous major floods. Herein, the flood disasters of the Yangtze River Basin in China in 1998 and 2020 are compared and analyzed from atmospheric, hydrological, socioeconomic, and disasterloss perspectives and the reasons behind the observed differences are examined and discussed. The findings indicate that risk-management capabilities, such as engineering defense capabilities, environmental recovery capabilities, forecasting and early-warning capabilities, and emergency response capabilities, have achieved remarkable results. The results show that disaster loss has been largely reduced because of China's achievements in disaster risk reduction measures. The problems and challenges faced by China's flood risk management are analyzed, and detailed watershed comprehensive flood risk management recommendations are put forward to reduce the losses caused by flooding.

J	Yazdani, M; Haghani, M				Yazdani, Maziar; Haghani, Milad			A dynamic emergency planning system for relocating vulnerable people to safe shelters in response to heat waves	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Dynamic planning; Transportation; Vulnerable people; Heatwave; Disaster risk management	EVACUATION RESPONSE; URBAN; HEALTH; IMPACT; ISLAND; DEFINITION; MODEL	A significant proportion of the world's population is ageing. As a result, numerous authorities and governments are formulating strategies to improve their citizens' services. Nevertheless, climate change and natural hazards have revealed the need for additional emergency plans tailored to the needs of the elderly. While recent studies have focused on certain types of disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, heat waves have not received as adequate attention in disaster response research. Using a model of emergency response developed in this study, we propose a dynamic optimization method to facilitate the rapid relocation of vulnerable people to designated shelters in order to minimize their exposure to heat waves. The proposed model views the problem as a dynamic evacuation planning in which requests for assistance from the emergency centre are received after the collection of people from their homes has begun. Subsequently, using some efficient optimisation methods, the strategy gets updated on a regular basis. The proposed model is evaluated using a case study that takes into account a randomly generated set of locations and relocation request in a local government area in Sydney, Australia. Results indicate that the proposed method is capable of generating acceptable response plans for relocating elderly individuals in the shortest possible time during actual emergencies induced by heat waves. In terms of emergency preparation, administration, and policy, this study's findings have implications for countries with urban areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects.

In this study, C stocks were assessed in the Endangered seagrass Zostera capensis. in the Knysna, Swartkops and Nxaxo estuaries, South Africa. Mean biomass C storage was 2.39 & PLUSMN; 1.42 Mg C ha-1 (similar to the global seagrass average), while 177.65 & PLUSMN; 122.29 Mg C ha-1 was estimated in the top meter of sediment. Sediment organic C content was 0.99 & PLUSMN; 0.45% - markedly lower than the seagrass global average but within the range reported for other Zostera species - and displayed significant spatial variability within and between estuaries. Sediment C was particularly high in the eutrophic Swartkops, likely due to excessive wastewater discharge introducing organic matter to the estuary's seagrass habitats. Based on the C stocks determine in this study, it is estimated that approximately 315 970 & PLUSMN; 217 111 Mg C could be stored in South Africa's 1755 ha of Z. capensis habitats. However, these important blue carbon habitats face multiple threats, particularly climatic events like droughts and floods, and anthropogenic eutrophication. This study has provided the first comprehensive C stock assessment for Z. capensis and contributes to global blue carbon datasets. Furthermore, this work has reinforced the importance of protecting the Endangered seagrass by highlighting the important ecosystem service it provides through climate change mitigation and adaptation.

However, most flood risk categorization and prediction efforts have been focused on the hydrologic features of flood hazards, often not considering subsequent long-term losses and recovery trajectories (i.e., community's flood resilience). In this study, a two-stage Machine Learning (ML)-based framework is developed to accurately categorize and predict communities' flood resilience and their response to future flood hazards. This framework is a step towards developing comprehensive, proactive flood disaster management planning to further ensure functioning urban centers and mitigate the risk of future catastrophic flood events. In this framework, resilience indices are synthesized considering resilience goals (i.e., robustness and rapidity) using unsupervised ML, coupled with climate information, to develop a supervised ML prediction algorithm. To showcase the utility of the framework, it was applied on historical flood disaster records collected by the US National Weather Services. These disaster records were subsequently used to develop the resilience indices, which were then coupled with the associated historical climate data, resulting in high-accuracy predictions and, thus, utility in flood resilience management studies. To further demonstrate the utilization of the framework, a spatial analysis was developed to quantify communities' flood resilience and vulnerability across the selected spatial domain. The framework presented in this study is employable in climate studies and patio-temporal vulnerability identification. Such a framework can also empower decision makers to develop effective data-driven climate resilience strategies.

J	Li, S; Qin, Y				Li, Shi; Qin, Yi			Frequency Analysis of the Nonstationary Annual Runoff Series Using the Mechanism-Based Reconstruction Method	WATER			English	Article						frequency analysis; annual runoff; nonstationary; mechanism-based reconstruction	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD; STATIONARITY; RISK; RELIABILITY; TRENDS; DEAD	Due to climate change and human activities, the statistical characteristics of annual runoff series of many rivers around the world exhibit complex nonstationary changes, which seriously impact the frequency analysis of annual runoff and are thus becoming a hotspot of research. A variety of nonstationary frequency analysis methods has been proposed by many scholars, but their reliability and accuracy in practical application are still controversial. The recently proposed Mechanism-based Reconstruction (Me-RS) method is a method to deal with nonstationary changes in hydrological series, which solves the frequency analysis problem of the nonstationary hydrological series by transforming nonstationary series into stationary Me-RS series. Based on the Me-RS method, a calculation method of design annual runoff under the nonstationary conditions is proposed in this paper and applied to the Jialu River Basin (JRB) in northern Shaanxi, China. From the aspects of rationality and uncertainty, the calculated design value of annual runoff is analyzed and evaluated. Then, compared with the design values calculated by traditional frequency analysis method regardless of whether the sample series is stationary, the correctness of the Me-RS theory and its application reliability is demonstrated. The results show that calculation of design annual runoff based on the Me-RS method is not only scientific in theory, but also the obtained design values are relatively consistent with the characteristics of the river basin, and the uncertainty is obviously smaller. Therefore, the Me-RS provides an effective tool for annual runoff frequency analysis under nonstationary conditions.

Social dynamics of community resilience building in the face of climate change: the case of three Scottish communities	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Regenerative cultures; Community development; Action research; Resilience building; Capacity; Vulnerability; Systems; Social dynamics	ADAPTATION; CORRIDORS; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; CULTURE	Meeting global targets that maintain temperatures at 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels while adapting to the growing impacts of climate change requires significant and rapid societal change. Within this context, there has been growing interest in building community resilience to shocks and stressors and as a forward-looking process. Yet while there has been extensive attention to conceptual aspects, there has been much less on how this can be achieved in practice. This research worked with three communities in Scotland (UK) regularly exposed to flooding and other integrated challenges to learn from action about community resilience building. A carefully developed four-tiered transdisciplinary approach was applied that included: relationship-building; enhancing capacities to work with interconnections; enabling processes; and supportive action-oriented research. The findings of the analysis of the system dynamics that were occurring during the resilience-building process highlight that it is a complex and messy social process. Yet, it also shows that if quality and sufficient quantity of support and time to help surface and deliberate on underlying assumptions about communities and change is provided, it can be possible to stimulate emergence of beneficial reinforcing social dynamics that begin to support collaborative and systemic action. To further advance know how about resilience building, much greater focus will be needed on the 'how' of resilience. This, in turn, will require new framings of, and approaches for, community resilience and new framings of research, knowledge and knowing.	[Fazey, I.; Carmen, E.; Kenter, J. O.; Stringer, L.

Only the land-surface parts of hydrological cycles are directly visible and represented in local knowledge and water-related legislation. Human impacts on water cycles (HIWC) can, beyond climate change, arise through effects on local and regional hydrological processes, from both reduced and increased water use compared to a natural reference vegetation with which landscape structure and hydrology are aligned. Precipitationsheds, the oceanic and terrestrial origin of rainfall, depend on evapotranspiration and thus on vegetation. The political commitment to reduce agricultural impact on nature requires hydrological mimetrics to trickle down through institutions to actions. Existing metrics do not suffice. For example, the water footprint metric that relates agricultural water use to consumption decisions, suggests minimizing water use is best, ignoring full hydrological impacts. We explore principles, criteria and indicators for understanding HIWC, via modified evapotranspiration, effects on streamflow (downstream impacts) and atmospheric fluxes and precipitation (downwind impacts). Comprehensive HIWC mimetrics for a set of pantropical watersheds suggest hydrological mimicry options for forest-derived land use patterns through intermediate densities of trees with diversity in rooting depth and water use, interacting with soils, crops and livestock.

Early warning systems have four components: (1) risk knowledge, (2) monitoring and warning, (3) warning dissemi-nation and communication, and (4) response capability. While there is room to improve all four of these components, we argue that the largest gaps in early warning systems fall in the latter two categories: warning dissemination/communication and response capability. We illustrate this by examining the four components of early warning systems for the deadliest and costliest meteo-rological disasters of this century, demonstrating that the lack of EWS protection is not a lack of forecasts or warnings, but rather a lack of adequate communication and lack of response capa-bility. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts is unlikely to offer major benefits without resolving these gaps in communication and response capability. To protect vulnerable groups around the world, we provide recommendations for investments that would close such gaps, such as improved communication channels, impact forecasts, early action policies and infrastructure.

Sensitivity analysis and logical reasoning with operators identified a feasible operational rule curve for testing using the integrated performance analysis. The reservoir performance for the altered operations was compared to the baseline performance following current operations for both historical and projected future climate and water demand conditions. Key simulation results show that the altered operations strategy tested under historical climate and water demand conditions would increase RRV by 17%, 67%, and 7%, respectively, for the water supply objective and 34%, 346%, and 22%, respectively, for hydropower generation. For projected future conditions, the proposed operations strategy would increase RRV by 7%, 219%, and 11%, respectively, for water supply and 19%, 136%, and 13% for hydropower generation. Synthesis of the results suggests significant benefits for reliability and resilience of water supply and hydropower are possible with slight operational adjustments. Overall, the integrated performance analysis supports the need to develop an optimized operations rule for Tarbela to adapt to projected climate and demand scenarios.

Hydrological modelling of climate change impacts on river flows in Siberia's Lena River Basin and implications for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th National Hydrology Symposium - Hydrology - Advances in Theory and Practice	SEP 12-13, 2018	Univ Westminster, London, ENGLAND		Univ Westminster	Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC); climate change; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5); Lena; RCP4; 5		A hydrological model of Siberia's Lena River Basin is calibrated and validated against observed river discharge at five stations. Implications of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario for river discharge are assessed using projections from 41 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 General Circulation Models grouped into 12 genealogical-based groups as well as a group ensemble mean. Annual precipitation increases in all scenarios (1.7-47.4%). Increases in annual PET are of a similar range (6.0-45.5%). PET peaks in June compared to July for the baseline. All temperature changes exceed 1.5 degrees C (range: 2.2 degrees C-6.2 degrees C). The largest absolute increases are in winter (maximum +7 degrees C). Changes in mean annual discharge range from -8.5 to +69.9%. Ten GCM groups and the group ensemble mean project increases. Earlier snowmelt is dominant so the annual flood peaks in May compared with June for the baseline. Increased discharge of the Lena and other Eurasian rivers to the Arctic Ocean has the potential to impact Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Enhanced fluxes for four groups are capable of weakening the AMOC. Changes for other groups may contribute to weakening when combined with other sources of freshwater and warmer temperatures.

J	Parsons, M				Parsons, Melissa			Extreme floods and river values: A social-ecological perspective	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						disasters; disturbance ecology; flood management; resilience; risk		The social-ecological status of rivers is particularly pronounced during extreme flood events. Extreme floods are a substantial threat to people, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Efforts to address the threats of extreme floods are aligned largely with social values of flood risk mitigation, flood preparation, and avoidance of loss. However, extreme floods are also a fundamental driver of river ecosystems, aligned with ecological (biophysical) values of event effectiveness, river change, disturbance, biotic response, and heterogeneity. A survey of the public perceptions of extreme floods revealed that participants generally understood the ecological values of extreme floods through concepts of naturalness, climate change, and knowledge production. However, participants had less understanding of how river integrity might influence the response of rivers to extreme floods. Resilience can be used as a framework for uniting the social and ecological values of extreme floods because it embodies a common language of change, disturbance, and adaptation and complements the socially dominated discourse of risk and emergency management. Three strategies are given for river scientists to frame ecological values in parallel with the paradigms of the socially dominated discourse of extreme floods: be prepared to act following an extreme flood disaster, learn and use the language of the flood risk and emergency management sector, and undertake assessments of the ecological values of extreme floods to highlight the threats to those values that may occur with climate change and river modification.

On September 15, 2022, a large part of central Italy, particularly Marche and Umbria regions, was struck by an anomalous rainfall event that showed characteristics of a persistent convective system. An extraordinary cumulated rainfall of 419 mm was recorded by a rain gauge in the area in only 9 h. The rainfall triggered 1687 landslides in the area affected by the peak rainfall intensity and caused widespread flash floods and floods in the central and lower parts of the catchments. In this work, we describe the characteristics of the landslides identified during a field survey started immediately after the event. Most of the mass movements are shallow, and many are rapid (i.e., debris flows, earth flows) and widely affecting the road network. Landslide area spans from a few tens of square meters to 10(5) m(2), with a median value of 87 m(2). Field evidence revealed diffuse residual risk conditions, being a large proportion of landslides located in the immediate vicinity of infrastructures. Besides reporting the spatial distribution of landslides triggered by an extreme rainfall event, the data collected on landslides can be used to make comparisons with the distribution of landslides in the past, validation of landslide susceptibility models, and definition of the general interaction between landslides and structures/infrastructures.

Mangrove Trees Outperform Saltmarsh Grasses in Building Elevation but Collapse Rapidly Under High Rates of Sea-Level Rise	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						mangrove; saltmarsh; sediment accretion; sea-level rise; model; climate change	GULF-OF-MEXICO; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; COASTAL WETLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FORESTS; ACCRETION; EXPANSION; RESPONSES; VULNERABILITY; DYNAMICS	Mangrove trees are invading saltmarshes at subtropical ecotones globally, but the consequences of this vegetation shift for ecosystem sustainability remain unknown. Using the Coastal Wetland Equilibrium Model (CWEM) to simulate vegetation survival and sediment accretion, we predict that black mangroves, Avicennia germinans, can build soil elevation by 8 mm yr(-1), four times greater than saltmarshes at the same site, a finding that is broadly consistent with field measurements of elevation change. Mangroves build elevation more rapidly than saltmarshes by producing much greater live and labile belowground biomass, but when mangroves drown, they abruptly lose elevation due to the large volume of quickly decomposing necromass following flood-induced mortality. Under certain conditions, young mangroves can accumulate root mass faster than mature trees and, therefore, gain elevation more rapidly, but neither saltmarshes nor mangroves of any age survived a centenary sea-level increase of 100 cm. The acceleration of sea-level rise that coastal marshes are encountering raises the question of how coastal wetlands should be optimally managed and these results provide managers with predictive information on wetland building capacity of mangroves versus marshes. Plain Language Summary The conversion of coastal wetlands from non-woody marsh grasses to mangrove forests is proceeding now in subtropical transition zones due to a warming climate. Conversion of salt marsh habitats to mangrove forests will enhance coastal protection and carbon storage.

Temporal changes in hippo group size in response to changes in wading areas have been described in river systems, but hippo group dynamics remain generally understudied and have not been quantified in a seasonal floodplain. We used monthly census data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle between August 2016 and July 2017 to identify changes in hippo distribution, density, and group size at the most used wading areas in the seasonal floodplain in Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa. We found that hippos congregate into large groups when the wading area decreases in seasonal floodplain systems, similar to perennial river systems. Moreover, as the inundation area increased, overall individual and group density decreased, hippo abundance decreased, and the mean distance between groups increased. Periods of low water availability tend to coincide with periods of food scarcity; thus, competition for water may compound with competition for food, likely affecting cycles of population growth or decline. Increased unpredictability in seasonal and annual rainfall patterns because of climate change will affect the predictability and availability of hippo wading areas, which will likely affect the distribution, size, and persistence of hippo populations. The results of our study provide additional information necessary for the conservation and management of hippos in seasonal floodplain systems in the context of climate change.	[Fritsch, Camille J.

The ice layers that form in a cold snowpack when R.O.S. events occur have been shown to influence flowthrough processes and liquid water retention, with consequences for winter floods, groundwater recharge, and water resources management. This study explores interconnections between meteorological conditions, ice layer formation, and lateral flows during R.O.S. events throughout the 2018-2019 winter in meridional Quebec, Canada. Automated hydro-meteorological measurements, such as water availability for runoff, snow water equivalent, and snowpit observations, are used to compute water and energy balances, making it possible to characterize a snowpack's internal conditions and flowthrough regimes. For compatibility assessment, water and energy balances-based flowthrough scenarios are then compared to different hydro-meteorological variables', such as water table or streamlet water levels. The results show an association between highly variable meteorological conditions, frequent R.O.S. events, and ice layer formation. Lateral flows were mainly observed during the early stage of the ablation period. The hydrologically significant lateral flows observed in the study are associated with winter conditions that are predicted to become more frequent in a changing climate, stressing the need for further evaluation of their potential impact at the watershed scale.

Consequently, it is important to explore new methods and technologies that are aiming to upscale and fast-track afforestation and reforestation (A/R) endeavors, given that many of the current tree planting strategies are not cost effective over large landscapes, and suffer from constraints associated with time, energy, manpower, and nursery-based seedling production. UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-supported seed sowing (UAVsSS) can promote rapid A/R in a safe, cost-effective, fast and environmentally friendly manner, if performed correctly, even in otherwise unsafe and/or inaccessible terrains, supplementing the overall manual planting efforts globally. In this study, we reviewed the recent literature on UAVsSS, to analyze the current status of the technology. Primary UAVsSS applications were found to be in areas of post-wildfire reforestation, mangrove restoration, forest restoration after degradation, weed eradication, and desert greening. Nonetheless, low survival rates of the seeds, future forest diversity, weather limitations, financial constraints, and seed-firing accuracy concerns were determined as major challenges to operationalization. Based on our literature survey and qualitative analysis, twelve recommendations-ranging from the need for publishing germination results to linking UAVsSS operations with carbon offset markets-are provided for the advancement of UAVsSS applications.

These migrants often reside in urban slums and struggle to access public services, which are already short in supply for existing slum dwellers. Given the inadequacy of governmental efforts, nonprofits have assumed responsibility for providing essential services such as housing, healthcare, and education. Would local slum-dwellers in Dhaka be willing to support such nonprofits financially? We deploy an in-person survey experiment with three frames (generic migrants, climate migrants, and religiously persecuted Rohingya migrants) to assess Dhaka slum-dwellers' willingness to support a humanitarian charity that provides healthcare services to migrants. Bangladesh is noted as a climate change hotspot and its government is vocal about the climate issue in international forums. While we expected this to translate into public support for climate migrants, we find respondents are 16% less likely to support climate migrants in relation to the generic migrants. However, consistent with the government's hostility towards Rohingya, we find that respondents are 9% less likely to support a charity focused on helping Rohingya migrants. Our results are robust even when we examine subpopulations such as recent arrivals in Dhaka and those who have experienced floods (both of which could be expected to be more sympathetic to climate migrants), as well as those who regularly follow the news (and hence are well informed about the climate and the Rohingya crisis).

While climate changes are considered to be a cause for all significant recent variations in meteorological and hydrological parameters, there is still a need for the analysis at the smaller regional scale, especially of the seawater level changes. A regional analysis is essential for early warning of upcoming changes that could, firstly, affect islands and coastal areas and, subsequently, expand on larger areas. The determined regional changes could affect the salinity of drinking water sources, increase the presence of natural flooding, and impact land degradation. In this paper, an analysis of local seawater level fluctuations is provided for three available locations in Croatia distributed along the Adriatic Sea's coast. The rescaled adjusted partial sums (RAPS) method was used and applied on time series of the average daily seawater levels for each location. Visual interpretation of the RAPS method indicated the appearance of common regularities of the observed quantities, in this case, averaged daily seawater level changes. Also, it was shown that the regional shape and indentation of the coast did not have a strong effect on the seawater level's rise. Seasonal changes in the sea level are mostly periodic and, therefore, have symmetry visible in its behavior. Fluctuations in the dynamics of sea level studied in this paper were not regular and predictable with simple linear equations, but the symmetry was also found to be present in the irregularities identified with the RAPS method.

Furthermore, agriculture is the main income basis of local farmers; especially, in Northeast Thailand, the ratio of irrigated agricultural land was only 7.6%, and others were rainfed so that climate change makes agricultural production increasingly unstable and inflicts serious damages on the societies and economies of rural areas. In this study, we focused on weather-induced economic damages of upland crops, such as sugarcane and cassava. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of the seasonal rainfall amount and pattern on upland crop yields through correlation analysis using meteorological and agricultural statistical data. The sugarcane yield had a significant positive relationship with 4 months of accumulated rainfall. The cassava yield had a significant negative relationship with 5 months of accumulated rainfall. Secondly, a household survey was conducted to grasp the farmers' conditions of water use, cultivation, income balance, etc. The average household income was 341,160 Baht/year, 122,433 Baht/year derived from agriculture and 218,727 Baht/year from non-agricultural work. The variation in farmers' income in each province by crop changing was evaluated using interview results. For farmers' livelihood, a monoculture system should be avoided because of the system's normally high risk and its vulnerability. As a result of analysis, mixed farming of sugarcane and cassava is recommended to stabilize farming incomes both in flood and in drought years.

Adaptation is the predominant practice that farming communities undertake to deal with these climate-induced challenges. While significant attention has been devoted to farmers' adaptation strategies, little is known about how innovative practices are associated with the improvement of rural livelihoods. To address this gap, the paper attempts to investigate how farmers lead the process of rural innovations that constitute successful forms of adaptation to address the mixed impacts of dyke policies and climate change in two distinct agro-ecological zones (i.e. flooding and salinity) in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Drawing on qualitative information collected from focus group discussions and interviews across the case studies, the paper argues that farmers are the key innovation actors who contribute to improving rural farming and water management practices. The study suggests that the evolution of farmer-led innovations is mainly attributed to the operation of various informal learning networks that provide important platforms for the generation and diffusion of effective innovative practices across farming communities. It also highlights how farmers contribute their innovative knowledge to local adaptation policies. From the policy perspective, this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers' adaptation, which needs to be scaled out to better support agricultural water management in the delta.

Identifying trends in long-term (more than 30 year) data is possible through a variety of methodologies as well as classical Mann-Kendall (MK), Regression (R), Spearman's Rho (SR) methods in addition to the innovative trend analysis (ITA) approaches. The most used method in the literature is the MK trend determination test, but it has limited assumptions, and the trend slope is calculated according to Sen's median procedure. However, Sen's approach is an empirical methodology that considers a single median slope from all possible consecutive lag slopes. This paper provides the theoretical probability distribution function (PDF) that matches Sen's slopes, and an innovative probabilistic trend slope methodology is proposed with a set of slope risk levels, rather than statistical slope calculation. The application of the proposed methodology is presented for long-term Danube River annual discharge data in Romania and precipitation records at Antalya resort center in the south along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. A set of trend lines, objectively different risk levels, are obtained. It has been determined that there are decreasing and increasing monotonic trends in each historical time series record. Therefore, for extreme events, it is possible to consider a particular risk level trend characteristic, i.e., floods and droughts, rather than the classical mean or median level trend definition.

J	Peng, L; Wang, YF; Yang, L; Garchagen, M; Deng, XZ				Peng, Lu; Wang, Yifei; Yang, Liang; Garchagen, Matthias; Deng, Xiangzheng			A comparative analysis on flood risk assessment and management performances between Beijing and Munich	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Flood risk assessment; Urban floods; Flood management; Resilient city; Comparative analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; PATTERNS	With climate change and rapid urbanization, the prevalent flood disasters and associated risks in urban areas have become increasingly crucial global issues. Risk assessment is a basic step in flood management and mitigation, while flood management is important to achieve risk mitigation. A comprehensive assessment framework considering both pre-and post-disasters that can address flood risk is lacking. Therefore, this study developed an integrated framework by combining the assessments of flood risk and flood management performance. Taking Beijing and Munich as research objects, this study generated flood risk maps at the grid scale for the period 2000-2020 and comparatively assessed the performance of various flood management measures. The urban flood risk in Beijing showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing one from 2000 to 2020, exhibiting high spatial characteristics in the southeast and low spatial characteristics in the northwest. The flood risk in Munich showed an overall decreasing trend, with strong spatial characteristics in the center area but less so in suburban areas. The shift from low to high urbanization levels was the major factor increasing the regional flood risk. Therefore, effective flood management measures in urban areas could potentially mitigate the flood risk, and Munich had a higher flood management performance owing to its well-developed flood management systems. This study provides a new framework for flood risk assessment and resilient flood management and contributes to the development of practical measures for disaster mitigation in rapidly-developing urban areas.

As an inherent characteristic of an urban system that reflects the degree of effect of flooding and the capacity to cope with it, urban flood vulnerability is of great significance when analyzing and managing flood disasters. To produce a better profile of the current status and the development trend of urban flood vulnerability research, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace software based on 1134 articles sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results showed that the annual publication number exhibited an ascending trajectory, which was characterized by three stages: the sprouting stage, the stable development stage and the rapid development stage. The United States, China and England were the most productive countries. Among the top co-cited journals were Natural Hazards, Natural Hazards and Earth System Science, Global Environmental Change and the Journal of Hydrology. In addition, the focus of this research can be succinctly summarized as vulnerability assessments and mapping, the impact of climate change and urbanization on urban flood vulnerability and the integration of urban flood vulnerability with flood risk and urban resilience. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the current status and development trends of research related to urban flood vulnerability, and it contributes an understanding of the key areas of focus in this field as well as insights into potential prospects for future investigation for researchers and practitioners.

In 2019, 935 new extreme events were detected in Turkey, with the most hazardous being heavy rain, floods, and windstorms. Ankara, the capital of Turkey, is one of the affected cities from these events. Understanding the characteristics of these events is crucial because extreme events have significant negative impact on social, physical. and economic environments. In this study,9 extreme-precipitation indices were determined and examined in terms of trends and statistical characteristics for the historical (1950-2015) and future (2015-2090) period at Ankara, Turkey. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-MR, and. GFDL-ESM2M model results under two representative concentration pathways (RCP), RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios at two grid cells (2733 and 2734) covering four major stations of Ankara were used to obtain future-period precipitation series. Moreover, extreme-value analyses were applied to daily precipitation data of historical (1950-2015) and projected (2050-2090) periods with peak-over-threshold (POT) and block maxima (BM) approaches, and the results were compared. Trend-test results, in general, yielded insignificant trends that were mostly negative. Results of extreme-value analyses show that Grid 2734 return-level values were considerably greater than those of Grid 2733. and variability increased with an increasing return period. Grid 2734 results also exhibited greater values than those of observation-period return levels, while return levels at Grid 2733 exhibited smaller values than the observation-period return-level values.

Native woodland establishment improves soil hydrological functioning inUKupland pastoral catchments	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						climate change; native woodland; natural flood management; soil hydrology; nature-based solutions; UK uplands	SMALL DARTMOOR CATCHMENT; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; LAND MANAGEMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; ENGLAND; IMPACT; VEGETATION; FLOODS; WATER; RESILIENCE	Extreme rainfall and flood events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. In UK upland areas, historical over-grazing and associated soil compaction have further exacerbated peak flood levels and flash-flood risk along many river catchments. As a result, the reinstatement of upland woodland is increasingly seen as a key component of an integrated suite of options forming part of natural flood management (NFM) associated with a 'public money for public goods' approach to European agriculture. Nevertheless, understanding the impact of native woodland establishment on upland soil hydrology remains relatively poor. We compare physical and hydrological properties from the surface soils of establishing woodland and grazed pasture across four flood vulnerable upland headwater catchments in Dartmoor National Park, SW England. We show upland native woodland establishment is a viable soil recovery option, with a doubling of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, increased 'wetness threshold' and reduced surface soil compaction and bulk density within 15 years of establishment. Our study supports the establishment of native woodland as an effective tool to improve the hydrological functioning of soils in upland pastoral catchments and the provision of flash-flood mitigation 'ecosystem services'. We caution, however, that land managers and policymakers must consider past and present management, soil type and catchment location when planning new NFM schemes if environmental benefits are to be maximised and 'public money for public goods, are to be commensurate with outcomes.

The study area in northern Bangladesh included two union council areas under the Panchagarh sub-district. Climatological data analysis, a detailed questionnaire survey, and focus group discussions were conducted to assess farmers' perceptions regarding the shifting and identification of hazards, their seasonal variation, and hazard prioritizations. The SMUG (seriousness, manageability, urgency, and growth) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) models were applied for hazard prioritization. Hailstorms were found to be the most prioritized hazard over droughts and flash floods as perceived by the community. The farmers' perceptions as evaluated through a questionnaire survey also support the findings of the SMUG and FEMA models. This was the first attempt to analyze the potential of hailstorms as a significant hazard in Bangladesh, and GIS maps showed their spatial distribution and temporal frequency across Bangladesh. This newly identified hazard is significantly diminishing farmers' motivation to continue farming and has the potential to affect sustainable agriculture. The farmers' perceptions, historical data analysis, use of the two models, institutional approach, hazard risk assessment, and vulnerability to the major sectors show that hailstorms should be considered as an important hazard in northern Bangladesh, and policymakers should pay urgent attention to minimize the threat to sustainable agriculture in northern Bangladesh.

J	Li, LY; Uyttenhove, P; Vaneetvelde, V				Li, Luyuan; Uyttenhove, Pieter; Vaneetvelde, Veerle			Planning green infrastructure to mitigate urban surface water flooding risk - A methodology to identify priority areas applied in the city of Ghent	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Flood resilient city; Greening strategy; Climate change adaptation; Geography Information System (GIS); Multi-criteria evaluation (MCE); Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)	CLIMATE; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; EUROPE; IMPACT; DAMAGE	Urban surface water floods pose growing threats in urban areas, which cause not only massive physical water disturbance, but also loss of human lives, destruction of social and economic infrastructures and disorder of society. The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.

How the USA can benefit from risk-based premiums combined with flood protection	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSURANCE; ADAPTATION; BEHAVIOR; COST; FRAMEWORK; PATHWAYS; LOSSES; LEVEL	Flood risk management in the USA is largely embedded in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Climate change and increasing exposure in flood plains pose a challenge to flood risk managers and make it vital to reduce risk in the future. The proposed reforms are steering the NFIP to risk-based premiums, but it is uncertain if the reforms will result in unaffordability and incentivize risk-reduction investments or how the NFIP is affected by large-scale adaptation efforts. Using an agent-based model approach for current and future scenarios, we demonstrate that risk-based premiums will yield a positive societal benefit (US$10 billion) because they will incentivize household risk-reduction investments. Moreover, our results show that proactive investment in large-scale adaptation measures complements a transition to risk-based premiums to yield a higher overall societal benefit (US$26 billion). We suggest that transitioning the NFIP to risk-based premiums can only be secured by additional investments in large-scale flood protection infrastructure. The National Flood Insurance Program is a key tool for managing growing flood risk in the USA. This research shows that premiums based on local risk, rather than national averages, will generate large societal benefits, and investments in large-scale adaptation infrastructure will enhance these impacts.

Climate change leads to heavy rainfall, flooding and hot weather events that are associated with waterborne diseases. Developing effective treatment technologies will improve our resilience to cope with these events and our capacity to safeguard public health. A submerged hybrid reactor was used to test the efficiency of membrane filtration, direct photolysis (using ultraviolet-C low-pressure mercury lamps, as well as ultraviolet-C and ultraviolet-A light-emitting diodes panels) and the combination of both treatment processes (membrane filtration and photolysis) to retain and inactivate water quality indicator bacteria. The developed photocatalytic membranes effectively retained the target microorganisms that were then successfully inactivated by photolysis and advanced oxidation processes. The new hybrid reactor could be a promising approach to treat drinking water, recreational water and wastewater produced by different industries in small-scale systems. Furthermore, the results obtained with membranes coated with titanium dioxide and copper combined with ultraviolet-A light sources show that the process may be a promising approach to guarantee water disinfection using natural sunlight.

Three emergencies of climate change: The case of Louisiana's coast	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Adaptation; Flood risk; Relocation; Sea level rise; Social learning; Transformation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ADAPTATION	Climate challenge brings three, not just one, emergencies. These are the visible, conceptual and existential, all of which are urgent and important. The three emergencies are starkly highlighted in Louisiana, where historical coastal development and climate-induced sea level rise is causing visible emergencies in the form of extensive land loss and increased impacts of flooding and storm surges, leading to forced relocation of settlements. The visible emergencies cannot be overcome without addressing conceptual emergencies where current ways of organising, thinking and approaching the challenges are inadequate for the scale, nature and rate of change. The conceptual emergencies, in turn, cannot be overcome without addressing the existential, where different cultures, values and identities are needed to overcome existing conceptual challenges. Louisiana's state government is beginning to go beyond the visible to wrestle with the conceptual and, to some extent, awareness is growing about the existential. The need to address the conceptual and existential will only increase as the limits of current approaches to addressing the visible emergencies become more apparent. As such, the case highlights how climate change will force a transformation that will be characterised by fundamentally new social attributes. The nature of what emerges, however, is not guaranteed and will depend on how those in Louisiana and beyond seek to work with all three emergencies and their interconnections.

To investigate the complexity of urban floods, this study applied an interlinked social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) vulnerability framework by developing an urban flood vulnerability index for six US cities. Indicators were selected to reflect and illustrate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to flooding for each of the three domains of SETS. We quantified 18 indicators and normalized them by the cities' 500-yr floodplain area at the census block group level. Clusters of flood vulnerable areas were identified differently by each SETS domain, and some areas were vulnerable to floods in more than one domain. Results are provided to support decision-making for reducing risks to flooding, by considering social, ecological, and technological vulnerability as well as hotspots where multiple sources of vulnerability coexist. The spatially explicit urban SETS flood vulnerability framework can be transferred to other regions facing challenging urban floods and other types of environmental hazards. Mapping SETS flood vulnerability helps to reveal intersections of complex SETS interactions and inform policy-making for building more resilient cities in the face of extreme events and climate change impacts.

Seven centuries of reconstructed Brahmaputra River discharge demonstrate underestimated high discharge and flood hazard frequency	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TREE-RING RECORD; SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; MONSOON FLOODS; BANGLADESH; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; GANGES	The lower Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh and Northeast India often floods during the monsoon season, with catastrophic consequences for people throughout the region. While most climate models predict an intensified monsoon and increase in flood risk with warming, robust baseline estimates of natural climate variability in the basin are limited by the short observational record. Here we use a new seven-century (1309-2004 C.E) tree-ring reconstruction of monsoon season Brahmaputra discharge to demonstrate that the early instrumental period (1956-1986 C.E.) ranks amongst the driest of the past seven centuries (13(th) percentile). Further, flood hazard inferred from the recurrence frequency of high discharge years is severely underestimated by 24-38% in the instrumental record compared to previous centuries and climate model projections. A focus on only recent observations will therefore be insufficient to accurately characterise flood hazard risk in the region, both in the context of natural variability and climate change. This study investigates flood hazards of the Brahmaputra River, Bangladesh. Based on a tree ring reconstruction of seasonal river discharge, climate modelling, and historic documentation of flood events, the authors suggest flood hazard risk is underestimated by similar to 24-38% in the present day compared to the past 700 years.

Using Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) to Identify Valued Landscapes Vulnerable to Sea Level Rise	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						coast; vulnerability; mapping; PPGIS; sea level rise	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; COASTAL VALUES; SPATIAL DATA; GIS PPGIS; MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; DESIGN; PERCEPTIONS	The U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast has a long history of intense and varied development, from energy infrastructure and seaports to vacation homes and tourism. Coastal populations and development are growing. Concurrently, global climate change will influence sea level rise, resulting in increased flooding, storm surge, and coastal erosion. Regional planners must prepare for sea level rise and develop adaptive solutions to maximize resiliency. Comprehensive coastal vulnerability mapping assessments (CVMA) can integrate social, economic, and physical vulnerability with spatial analysis of natural hazards for local place-based investigations. Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) are a potentially important tool for the spatial collection of stakeholder knowledge for CVMA. The objective of this study was to assess the locations of a range of landscape values, ecosystem services, and development preferences held and identified by the general public using PPGIS to determine if those valued locations are vulnerable to sea level rise. We found that PPGIS can be used to map a wide variety of landscape values and that they can be used to assess vulnerability to sea level rise. We conclude with a discussion on how to integrate PPGIS into participatory CVMA for sea level rise planning.

Drone Lidar Deep Learning for Fine-Scale Bare Earth Surface and 3D Marsh Mapping in Intertidal Estuaries	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Drone Lidar; point cloud; bare earth surface; 3D coast; deep learning	ACCURACY	Tidal marshes are dynamic environments providing important ecological and economic services in coastal regions. With accelerating climate change and sea level rise (SLR), marsh mortality and wetland conversion have been observed on global coasts. For sustainable coastal management, accurate projection of SLR-induced tidal inundation and flooding requires fine-scale 3D terrain of the intertidal zones. The airborne Lidar systems, although successful in extracting terrestrial topography, suffer from high vertical uncertainties in coastal wetlands due to tidal effects. This study tests the feasibility of drone Lidar leveraging deep learning of point clouds on 3D marsh mapping. In an ocean-front, pristine estuary dominated by Spartina alterniflora, drone Lidar point clouds, and in-field marsh samples were collected. The RandLA-Net deep learning model was applied to classify the Lidar point cloud to ground, low vegetation, and high vegetation with an overall accuracy of around 0.84. With the extracted digital terrain model and digital surface model, the cm-level bare earth surfaces and marsh heights were mapped. The bare earth terrain reached a vertical accuracy (root-mean-square error, or RMSE) of 5.55 cm. At the 65 marsh samples, the drone Lidar-extracted marsh height was lower than the in-field height measurements. However, their strongly significantly linear relationship (Pearson's r = 0.93) reflects the validity of the drone Lidar for measuring marsh canopy height. The adjusted Lidar-extracted marsh height had an RMSE of 0.12 m. This experiment demonstrates a multi-step operational procedure to deploy drone Lidar for accurate, fine-scale terrain and 3D marsh mapping, which provides essential base layers for projecting wetland inundation in various climate change and SLR scenarios.

Wildlife rehabilitation records reveal impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife health	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Toxicants; Endangered species; Climate change; Extreme weather events; Lead; Pesticides	UNITED-STATES; FISHING GEAR; LEAD; EXPOSURE; CALIFORNIA; EAGLES; AMMUNITION; MORTALITY; SURVEILLANCE; CONSERVATION	Wildlife faces many threats from anthropogenic activities and human-driven climate change. In this article, we use data from wildlife rehabilitation (rehab) centers, which admit and treat injured and sick wildlife, to understand the prevalence, patterns, and impacts of these threats and prioritize wildlife conservation efforts. Past studies have generally been more limited in geographic and taxonomic scope. We analyzed 674,320 digitized records from 94 wildlife rehab centers across the U.S. and Canada to learn about threats to over 1000 animal species. We identified key threats by examining conditions causing animals to be brought to centers. Overall, the largest proportion of wildlife injury and sickness were accounted for by human activities, including vehicle collisions, fishing-related incidents, and window or building collisions. Seasonal patterns in lead and pesticide exposure highlighted threats posed by hunting with lead ammunition and rodenticide use. We identified threats to iconic and threatened species such as bald eagles, brown pelicans, big brown bats, and common loons. We found that more animals arrived at rehab centers in the week after extreme weather events compared to the week before, for certain weather events in certain locations: e.g., hurricanes and floods in southern Florida. Across all species, wildlife rehabilitators were able to return about a third of treated animals back to the wild. These findings point to possible interventions to conserve wildlife populations and improve wildlife health, such as additional wildlife road crossings, improved regulations relating to fishing, hunting, and pesticide use, and incorporating wildlife into disaster management plans.

Machine Learning Enhances Flood Resilience Measurement in a Coastal Area - Case Study of Morocco	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						resilience; flooding; composite indicators; machine learning; flood resilience index	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; NATURAL DISASTERS; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; HAZARDS; INDEX; PRECIPITATION	Understanding the characteristics contributing to enhancing flood resilience is a matter of urgency in managing urban areas, especially for developing countries, given the challenges imposed by climate change, social growth and urbanization. Identifying resilience metrics remains challenging, mainly because the concept is relatively new, methodological approaches are almost absent, and many types of resilience-related data are still unavailable. A number of indices for flood resilience have been introduced in the literature, typically based on clustering algorithms that allow complex behaviors to be mapped to specific levels of resilience. Consequently, the qualitative aspects of such indices are highly sensitive to the availability, quality and heterogeneity of data. Historically, this assessment has often been performed using rather simple algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Whilst they allow reliable resilience metrics in some areas, their use in a complex urban system such as the northern coastal area in Morocco is arguable. In the present study, we introduce an advanced Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to build a Flood Resilience Index (FRI). Compared to classical methodologies, this present technique allows an improved assimilation of the complex relationship between data representing the social, economic and physical status of the area and resilience level. The success of this approach is mainly due to the ability of SOM to deal with complex, heterogeneous and sparse datasets. The results demonstrate great potential for such algorithms to shed light on systems that are too complex for classical techniques.

The results show that a 1m SLR would increase the tidal range by 35% and raise the velocity of currents inside the lagoon from an average speed of 0.31 m/s (present) to 0.43 m/s (future), with maximum currents of 1.4 m/s occurring near the tidal inlet during the flood tide and 0.8 m/s during ebb tide. This increase in tidal velocity would also increase the rate of water circulation in the lagoons, significantly reducing the local flushing time. The present conditions revealed that inner areas of the lagoon experience increased local flushing times compared to the outer regions of the lagoon, which may impact water quality status in the inner sectors. Overall, in the model, the local flushing time was reduced from 27 days (present) to 14 days (future), reflecting a 50% reduction. This would suggest that a 1m SLR would result in a more efficient dispersal of materials out of the lagoons.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gaisie, E; Cobbinah, PB				Gaisie, Eric; Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful			Planning for context-based climate adaptation: Flood management inquiry in Accra	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate impacts; Accra; Flood events; Urban planning; Climate adaptation; Ghana	AFRICAN CITIES; VULNERABILITY; URBANIZATION; KUMASI; SECTOR; RISKS; DELTA; GHANA; CITY	Discourses on climate change often characterise African cities as homogenous, experiencing the same climate events and requiring the same planning solutions. However, African cities are diverse and different across re-gions, scales, and contexts, despite some resemblance of urban problems. This paper addresses the generalisation of climate change issues and urban planning responses in African cities by: (i) exploring how climate impact, specifically flooding is different in one African city in terms of shaping the urban space; and (ii) examining the usefulness of city-focused and driven urban planning responses in addressing these risks. Using Accra, Ghana's capital, as a case study and mixed methods approach, findings indicate that despite the commonality of flood events across African cities, Accra's case is caused by a complex web of locally induced factors such as limited understanding of the geography and hydrology of the city by urban planning authorities, poor practice of informality, and changing weather patterns. Yet, the limited understanding of local driving causes of flooding in Accra has contributed to the use of unworkable top-down general responses (e.g., evictions and demolitions). The case of Accra demonstrates that increased preparedness (involving individuals, households, and institutions) is required to enhance adaptation to flood events rather than the current top-down response approach. In this case, we argue that a general approach to urban planning to address flood events across African cities may not work in all situations. Areas requiring further research are proffered, notably ways for capturing, integrating, and disseminating local knowledge in internationally funded flood planning and management initiatives.

Despite significant improvements in flood risk and exposure modeling in some studies, there is still a lack of evidence on the spatiotemporal distribution patterns associated with flood risk across the globe. Meanwhile, numerous studies mostly explore flood risk distribution patterns based on specific spatial scales, ignoring to some extent the fact that flood risk has different distribution patterns on different scales. Here, on the basis of hazard-vulnerability components quantified using game theory (GT), we proposed a framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of global flood risk and the influencing factors behind them on multiple scales. The results revealed that global flood risk increased during 2005-2020, with the percentages of high-risk areas being 4.3%, 4.48%, 4.6%, and 5.02%, respectively. There were 11 global risk hotspots, mainly located in areas with high population concentration, high economic density, abundant precipitation, and low elevation. On the national scale, high-risk countries were mainly concentrated in East Asia, South Asia, Central Europe, and Western Europe. In our experiment, developed countries accounted for the majority of the 20 highest risk countries in the world, with Singapore being the highest risk country and El Salvador having the highest positive risk growth rate (growing by 19.05% during 2015-2020). The findings of this study offer much-needed information and reference for academics researching flood risk under climate change.

An analysis of severe casualties from the 2021 flash flood and mudslide disaster in Germany	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Flood; Natural catastrophe; Infectious diseases; Trauma surgery; Natural disaster; Climate change		Background The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse the most severe casualties from the flash flood and mudslides occurring on 14 July 2021 in Germany, focusing on patients who were treated in the closest and largest level I trauma centre in the region the disaster occurred. Methods A single-centre retrospective study design was employed, and all patients treated because of the flooding and mudslides who needed inpatient treatment were documented. Data on each patient's demographic characteristics, type of injury, number of surgeries, duration of hospitalisation, operation time, revision rate, injury severity score (ISS), and complications were collected. The primary outcome measure was status at discharge. Results Within the first week after the flood, a total of 63 patients were documented. Forty-one patients were treated on an outpatient basis in the emergency unit, and 22 patients were hospitalised. Of those hospitalised, 15 patients needed surgical treatment in the operation theatre. The most common injuries were fractures of the lower extremity (n = 7) and soft tissue wounds (n = 4) . Overall, 20 surgeries were performed; the mean hospital stay was 7.2 +/- 6.4 days, and the mean ISS was 5.7 +/- 2.7. Conclusion The July 2021 flood disaster was one of the largest in German history. The included patients showed complex injuries of various types. Because of the effects of climate change, orthopaedic surgeons might face higher numbers of casualties affected by natural disasters. Learning more about the management and profile of these injuries can become a future challenge for orthopaedic and trauma surgeons.

Determination and prioritization of criteria to design urban energy resilience conceptual model (Part 1)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Criteria; Energy management; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Resilience; Urban Energy	SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; RISK; CITY	Nowadays, around 70% percent of global energy usage is consumed in urban areas. Undoubtedly, this figure will increase in coming decades due to population rise. As a result, energy resiliency can be considered as an important issue in urban context. Resilience of energy supply in urban areas can be categorized in two approaches, short-term and long-term. Short-term applies to cope with threats such as earthquakes and floods, and long-term applies to deal with impacts of climate change on global warming. In this study, literature review was applied to design questionnaire for expert survey, followed by Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method to categorize 34 sub-criteria divided under four main factors, i.e., technical and infrastructural, built environment, governance, and socio-cultural. The sub-criteria of each group were also prioritized in both short-term resiliency and climate change impact. Energy storage system, urban development pattern and population density, education planning, participatory governance, and culture building and public awareness, are sub-criteria with high priorities in short-term approach. In the long term, they consist of increasing energy efficiency through innovation, producing energy from renewable sources, mitigation methods of energy consumption in buildings, regulatory basis and executive requirements, mechanisms for attracting private sector investment in low-carbon development, culture building and public awareness. All these prioritization scheme can be applied to define a composite index to evaluate the level of energy resilience in the urban areas, and such index allows comparing the level of resilience for different cities.

The Spatiotemporal Evolution of Rainfall Extremes in a Changing Climate: A CONUS-Wide Assessment Based on Multifractal Scaling Arguments	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate change; extreme rainfall; multifractals; intensity-duration-frequency curves; rainfall intensification	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RESOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; MODELS; SERIES	Given the rapidly changing climate, accurate spatiotemporal information on the evolution of extreme rainfall events is required for flood risk assessment and the design of resilient infrastructure. Consequently, various research efforts have focused on investigating the appropriateness of various parametric and non-parametric approaches in modeling the observed changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall over time. Yet, the assumption of stationarity, or the change of model parameters when accounting for nonstationary rainfall, may magnify estimation uncertainty of rain rates associated with low exceedance probabilities. Moreover, the use of climate model results may yield inconclusive outcomes, given the existence of epistemic uncertainties in the frequency of extreme events developing on smaller spatial scales or over complex terrain. Herein, we employ a parametric approach based on multifractal scaling arguments, along with high-resolution (4-km) hourly precipitation estimates covering a 40-year period over CONUS, to derive Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves and investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of extreme rainfall over a wide range of characteristic temporal scales and exceedance probability levels. Considering the robustness of the multifractal models even when fitted to short rainfall records, we uniquely apply the framework to sequential 10-year segments of data, where the rainfall process can be reasonably assumed stationary. The obtained results reveal that existing infrastructure may be severely impacted by the intensification of precipitation extremes due to climate change, with the observed trends being significantly influenced by the topography and rainfall climatology of each region, while depending on the averaging durations and return periods of interest.

The wind setup constraint	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Venice Lagoon; Flood management; Climate change; Mo; S; E; system; Wind setup	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; DRAINAGE-BASIN; TIME; SCENARIOS; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; DAMAGE	The last IPCC report highlights that, along the present century, sea level rise driven by climate change will exacerbate the flooding frequency in coastal areas. Among others, the Venice Lagoon is one of the most vulnerable because of the presence of worldly famous historical urban settlements. To face this, a mobile flap gate system (Mo.S.E.) is nearly completed and has already raised across the lagoon inlets under testing phase to protect Venice from flooding. However, relative sea level rise and the wind setup effect during the closure of the lagoon, pose relevant management challenges such as timing and frequency to operate the barriers. In the present work, we first highlight some issues related to the management protocol currently adopted. We suggest a new strategy that optimizes the gate operation by identifying the shortest duration of closure that simultaneously prevents the flooding of all urban settlements within the lagoon. The new strategy is then used to estimate the Mo.S.E. management considering the last 20-year-long tidal record, but also for investigating different scenarios of relative sea level rise. The analysis we propose proves that the enhanced wind setup constraint will lead the Mo.S.E. system to fail in controlling all flood events starting from a relative sea level rise of +0.40 m. In addition, wind setup will increasingly often produce long and repeated closures, requiring further measures to combine flood protection, port and industrial activities and the conservation of the lagoon ecosystem.

In this paper, we develop a new approach for examining lived connections between fossil fuel extraction and climate change. We propose the concept of carbon mobilization to describe the multiple stages of fossil fuel extraction and combustion that may be experienced independently (as an economic boom, climate disaster, or air pollution, for example) or simultaneously, in locally distinctive combinations - but until now have been considered separately in most scholarship and public policy. We explore lived experiences of carbon mobilization in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, a community that, in the last decade, has gone through a shale gas boom and bust and has suffered from severe flooding. Interviews with social service providers and county leaders indicated that connections between the fossil fuel industry and climate disaster manifested most saliently around housing security-particularly the loss of housing due to floods and economic insecurity related to boom-bust cycles. Economic changes that gas development brought to the community made flood resilience more challenging for some, and easier for others. Perhaps surprisingly, the natural gas industry was a "double winner," benefitting from climate disaster by gaining a reputation for helping with flood recovery. We suggest that while global climate discourse may not resonate locally in communities that host fossil fuel extraction, people make locally-salient connections between different stages of carbon mobilization, and these connections have important public policy and social justice implications.

Cloud conditions limit their potential, especially while monitoring floods or storms that are usually related to cloudy situations. Conversely, data from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) are operational in all-weather conditions and are sensitive to the geometrical properties of crops. Apple orchards play a key role in the Italian agriculture sector, presenting a cultivation system that is very sensitive to high-wind events. In this work, the H-alpha-A polarimetric decomposition technique was adopted to map damaged apple orchards with reference to a stormy event that had occurred in the study area (NW Italy) on 12 August 2020. The results showed that damaged orchards have higher H (entropy) and alpha (alpha angle) values compared with undamaged ones taken as reference (Mann-Whitney one-tailed test U = 14,514, p < 0.001; U = 16604, p < 0.001 for H and alpha, respectively). By contrast, A (anisotropy) values were significantly lower for damaged orchards (Mann-Whitney one-tailed test U = 8616, p < 0.001). Based on this evidence, the authors generated a map of potentially storm-damaged orchards, assigning a probability value to each of them. This map is intended to support local funding restoration policies by insurance companies and local administrations.

Planning green infrastructure placement based on projected precipitation data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green infrastructure; Climate change adaptation; Floods; Projected precipitation; Downscaling	IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FLOOD RISK; URBAN; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPE; FRAMEWORK; INCREASE; SYSTEMS	Continued urbanization has led to tremendous changes on the landscape. These changes have exacerbated the effects of extreme climatic events such as flooding because of constrained water infiltration and increased surface flow. Typical runoff control measures involve sophisticated gray infrastructure that guide excess surface flow into storage and disposal sites. In a dynamic climate system, these measures are not sustainable since they cannot be easily modified to accommodate large volumes of runoff. Green Infrastructure (GI) is an adaptable technique that can be used to minimize runoff, in addition to offering an array of additional benefits (urban heat regulation, aesthetics, improved air quality etc.). Strategic placement of GI is key to achieving maximum utility. While physical site characteristics play a major role in determining suitable GI placement sites, knowledge of future precipitation patterns is crucial to ensure successful flood mitigation. In this paper, suitable GI sites within the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, were determined based on potential impact of an extreme flood event as indicated by site characteristics. Then, the relative potential likelihood of a flood event was determined based on projected precipitation data and knowledge of existing flood zones. By combining potential impact with likelihood information, low, medium, and high priority GI implementation sites were established. Results indicate that high priority sites are in the central parts of the city with priority decreasing outward. The GI prioritization scheme presented here, offers valuable guidance to city planners and policy makers who wish to exploit the GI approach for flood mitigation.

However, our knowledge of their influence on flood regime on the centennial to millennial timescales remains limited, and this is mainly because of the difficulty in directly determining the long-term hydrological variability of the Changjiang River over the period before hydrological gauges were established. Based on multiproxy analysis that combines chronological, sedimentological, and geochemical analysis of a 4.8-m-long sediment core retrieved from the subaqueous delta of the Changjiang River, this study establishes a flood history for the Changjiang River during the late Holocene. Our palaeoflood reconstruction revealed 14 multi-decadal periods of extreme floods (19-66 BCE, 25-80, 255-350, 415-475, 550-710, 740-835, 970-990, 1080-1130, 1170-1235, 1275-1390, 1440-1500, 1560-1730, 1810-1830, and 1950-2011 CE). These flood units match well with the observed large floods, documentary records of floods, and sedimentary flood deposits, confirming that the coarse units in the sequence are flood-derived and are regionally representative. Comparing with regional and global palaeoclimate records indicates that major flood events of the Changjiang are strongly modulated by the Asian summer monsoon and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but that anthropogenic impacts (e.g. artificial channelization and land clearance) have also greatly amplified the flooding frequency over the past 600 yr.

J	Williams, LL; Lück-Vogel, M				Williams, Lauren Lyn; Luck-Vogel, Melanie			Comparative assessment of the GIS based bathtub model and an enhanced bathtub model for coastal inundation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						GIS; LiDAR; Climate change; Hazard; Flood; Vulnerability; Coast; Inundation; Bathtub	VULNERABILITY	Coastal zones are dynamic spaces where human activities and infrastructure are exposed to natural forces, climate change and extreme weather events such as storm surges. Coastal inundation is regarded as one of the most dangerous and destructive natural hazards, and while there are many studies to analyse these events, GIS based methods are limited. This research aimed at developing a GIS based enhanced Bathtub Model (eBTM) that improves on the widely used simple Bathtub Model (sBTM) to make it more appropriate to a storm surge related coastal inundation context. The eBTM incorporates beach slope, surface roughness and instils hydrological connectivity relevant for event scale coastal flooding, unlike the sBTM which only uses topographic elevation above sea level as input. For a test site in Cape Town, South Africa, inundation levels for 3 independent scenarios were calculated using the average spring tides level, extreme sea level for a 1-in-100-year storm and two sea-level rise scenarios. Each scenario was run on both the sBTM and the eBTM developed through this study. Comparing the results, the eBTM method overall produced more conservative inundation results and also produced less disconnected areas of (unrealistic) inundation. The eBTM also produces inundation water levels relative to structures, thus showing the potential for quantifying the coastal inundation risk to infrastructure, which is of relevance in the disaster response context. Additionally, the impact of using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) instead of Digital Surface Models (DSM) on the inundation results was tested. The use of a DSM, including buildings and other objects, showed more realistic trajectories of the inundation water moving through the model area.

Impacts of Flooding and Flood Preparedness on Subjective Well-Being: A Monetisation of the Tangible and Intangible Impacts	JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES			English	Review						Flooding; Subjective well-being; Intangible losses; Tangible losses; Climate change; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation	DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; DISASTER; HEALTH; GOODS	Flood disasters severely impact human subjective well-being (SWB). Nevertheless, few studies have examined the influence of flood events on individual well-being and how such impacts may be limited by flood protection measures. This study estimates the long term impacts on individual subjective well-being of flood experiences, individual subjective flood risk perceptions, and household flood preparedness decisions. These effects are monetised and placed in context through a comparison with impacts of other adverse events on well-being. We collected data from households in flood-prone areas in France. The results indicate that experiencing a flood has a large negative impact on subjective well-being that is incompletely attenuated over time. Moreover, individuals do not need to be directly affected by floods to suffer SWB losses since subjective well-being is lower for those who expect their flood risk to increase or who have seen a neighbour being flooded. Floodplain inhabitants who prepared for flooding by elevating their home have a higher subjective well-being. A monetisation of the aforementioned well-being impacts shows that a flood requires Euro150,000 in immediate compensation to attenuate SWB losses. The decomposition of the monetised impacts of flood experience into tangible losses and intangible effects on SWB shows that intangible effects are about twice as large as the tangible direct monetary flood losses. Investments in flood protection infrastructure may be under funded if the intangible SWB benefits of flood protection are not taken into account.

Coastal Flood Risk Assessment: An Approach to Accurately Map Flooding through National Registry-Reported Events	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						sea flood prediction; flooding maps; climate change resilience; natural disaster registry; coastal inundation; flood-prone areas	ENSEMBLE SEA-LEVEL; SPATIAL ASSOCIATION	The escalating frequency and severity of climate-related hazards in the Mediterranean, particularly in the historic town of Piran, Slovenia, underscore the critical need for enhanced coastal flood prediction and efficient early warning systems. This study delves into the impediments of available coastal flood hazard maps and the existing early warning system, which rely on distant sensors, neglecting the town's unique microclimate. The current study leverages the public registry maintained by the Administration of the Republic of Slovenia for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief (URSZR), an underutilized resource for generating comprehensive and accurate flooding maps for Piran. Here, we show that in the historic town of Piran, floodings reported through the national registry can be used to map coastal flooding by means of verification and validation of the georeferenced reports therein, with subsequent correlation analysis (hotspot, cluster, and elevation polygons) that show temporal and spatial patterns. The innovative approach adopted in this study aims to bolster the accuracy and reliability of flooding data, offering a more nuanced understanding of flood patterns (in Piran, but generally applicable where national or regional registries are available). The findings of this research illuminate the pressing need for localized field-report and sensor systems to enhance the precision of flood predictions. The study underscores the pivotal role of accurate, localized data in fortifying coastal towns against the escalating impacts of climate change, safeguarding both the inhabitants and the invaluable architectural heritage of historic areas.

Observed and projected trends in spring flood discharges for the Upper Harricana River, eastern boreal Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Boreal hydrology; Climate change; Spring flood; CMIP5; Downscaled Global Climate Models	REGIONAL REGRESSION-MODELS; SNOW COVER VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; NORTHERN QUEBEC; HYDROLOGICAL EXTREMES; SOUTHERN QUEBEC; PART I; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; LAKE	Study region: In northwestern Que & PRIME;bec, the Upper Harricana River is representative of the Abitibi Plains' hydrological dynamics over the last 250 years. Study focus: Planning for future spring flood risks involves uncertainties. This research presents a multicentury evaluation of changes in spring mean discharge and flood drivers using streamflow reconstruction (1771-2016), observations (1915-2020) and projections (2021-2100). New hydrological insights for the region: Using a downscaled CMIP5 ensemble of 10 global climate models (GCMs), generalized additive mixed modeling of mean spring discharge projections matched those of an independent mechanistic model and eight GCMs projected variability in spring discharge by 2100 to be similar to the historical variability reconstructed for the last 250 years across the Abitibi Plains. Results indicate that the projected decline in snow cover (-20 to -30% annual snowfall) and rise in winter and spring temperature may be offset by a greater contribution of rainfall to spring high discharge (+100 to +125 mm). However, two GCMs projected an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high mean spring discharge for the Abitibi Plains. By investigating future mean spring discharge for the Upper Harricana River in reference to past reconstructed variability, this study provides insights to inform the future management of regional water resources. The importance of estimating future regional flood risks from the behavior of multi-model ensembles is highlighted.	[Nolin, A.

Wetlands Insight Tool: Characterising the Surface Water and Vegetation Cover Dynamics of Individual Wetlands Using Multidecadal Landsat Satellite Data	WETLANDS			English	Article						Wetland characterisation; Landsat; Earth observation; Australia; Hydroperiod; Hydrological regime	TIME-SERIES; LONG-TERM; THEMATIC MAPPER; BRDF CORRECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AUSTRALIA; IMAGERY; RIVER; BIODIVERSITY; INUNDATION	Wetlands around the world provide crucial ecosystem services and are under increasing pressure from multiple sources including climate change, changing flow and flooding regimes, and encroaching human populations. The Landsat satellite imagery archive provides a unique observational record of how wetlands have responded to these impacts during the last three decades. Information stored within this archive has historically been difficult to access due to its petabyte-scale and the challenges in converting Earth observation data into biophysical measurements that can be interpreted by wetland ecologists and catchment managers. This paper introduces the Wetlands Insight Tool (WIT), a workflow that generates WIT plots that present a multidecadal view of the biophysical cover types contained within individual Australian wetlands. The WIT workflow summarises Earth observation data over 35 years at 30 m resolution within a user-defined wetland boundary to produce a time-series plot (WIT plot) of the percentage of the wetland covered by open water, areas of water mixed with vegetation ('wet'), green vegetation, dry vegetation, and bare soil. We compare these WIT plots with documented changes that have occurred in floodplain shrublands, alpine peat wetlands, and lacustrine and palustrine wetlands, demonstrating the power of satellite observations to supplement ground-based data collection in a diverse range of wetland types. The use of WIT plots to observe and manage wetlands enables improved evidence-based decision making.
