The other side of tropical forest drought: do shallow water table regions of Amazonia act as large-scale hydrological refugia from drought?Palavras-ChavePalabras clave	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review						climate change forecasting; ecosystem function; hydrological regimes; soil moisture; tipping points; tropical forests	TREE LIVE BIOMASS; PHOTOSYNTHETIC SEASONALITY; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; EVERGREEN FORESTS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; FLOOD TOLERANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL	Tropical forest function is of global significance to climate change responses, and critically determined by water availability patterns. Groundwater is tightly related to soil water through the water table depth (WT), but historically neglected in ecological studies. Shallow WT forests (WT < 5 m) are underrepresented in forest research networks and absent in eddy flux measurements, although they represent c. 50% of the Amazon and are expected to respond differently to global-change-related droughts. We review WT patterns and consequences for plants, emerging results, and advance a conceptual model integrating environment and trait distributions to predict climate change effects. Shallow WT forests have a distinct species composition, with more resource-acquisitive and hydrologically vulnerable trees, shorter canopies and lower biomass than deep WT forests. During 'normal' climatic years, shallow WT forests have higher mortality and lower productivity than deep WT forests, but during moderate droughts mortality is buffered and productivity increases. However, during severe drought, shallow WT forests may be more sensitive due to shallow roots and drought-intolerant traits. Our evidence supports the hypothesis of neglected shallow WT forests being resilient to moderate drought, challenging the prevailing view of widespread negative effects of climate change on Amazonian forests that ignores WT gradients, but predicts they could collapse under very strong droughts.

However, since the early 20th century, land cover rapidly changed from predominantly agricultural land use (72%; 1909) to forest. West Virginia (WV) is now the USA's third most forested state by area (79%; 1989-present). It is well understood that land cover alterations feedback on climate with important implications for ecology, water resources, and watershed management. However, the spatiotemporal distribution of climatic changes during reforestation in WV remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation data were acquired for eighteen observation sites with long periods of record (POR; >= 77 years). Results indicate an increasingly wet and temperate WV climate characterized by warming summertime minimum temperatures, cooling maximum temperatures year-round, and increased annual precipitation that accelerated during the second half (1959-2016) of the POR. Trends are elevation dependent and may be accelerating due to local to regional ecohydrological feedbacks including increasing forest age and density, changing forest species composition, and increasing globally averaged atmospheric moisture. Furthermore, results imply that excessive wetness may become the primary ecosystem stressor associated with climate change in the USA's rugged and flood prone Appalachian region. The Appalachian region's physiographic complexity and history of widespread land use changes makes climatic changes particularly dynamic. Therefore, mechanistic understanding of micro- to mesoscale climate changes is imperative to better inform decision makers and ensure preservation of the region's rich natural resources.

Tourism is now seen as one of the economic sectors least equipped for the risks and opportunities provided by climate change, and it is just now establishing the capacity to advance the knowledge required to teach businesses, communities, and governments about the concerns and potential solutions. As a small coastal island, Prince Edward Island (PEI) on Canada's Atlantic coast is highly vulnerable to climate change extremes, including coastal erosion, sea-level rise, and flooding. The island's tourism industry generates substantial revenue for businesses and the government, yet it is highly vulnerable to the climate extremes that impact beach and sea-faring attractions. Limited research has been reported on this topic, and most information on island tourism and how sustainable tourism is achievable is out of date. Here, we present evidence of climate-related impacts and vulnerabilities in tourism within PEI and highlight existing and future adaptation strategies to support sustainability in this sector. Key information gaps are highlighted, and recommendations are proposed to facilitate climate resilience in Prince Edward Island's tourism sector.

Conf. on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (Berlin: Springer) pp 417-25, Yanardag et al 2017 Deep Empathy). In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of a conditional generative model that illustrates the consequences of climate change-induced flooding to encourage public interest and awareness on the issue. Because metrics for comparing the realism of different modes in a conditional generative model do not exist, we propose several automated and human-based methods for evaluation. To do this, we adapt several existing metrics and assess the automated metrics against gold standard human evaluation. We find that using Frechet Inception Distance with embeddings from an intermediary Inception-v3 layer that precedes the auxiliary classifier produces results most correlated with human realism. While insufficient alone to establish a human-correlated automatic evaluation metric, we believe this work begins to bridge the gap between human and automated generative evaluation procedures, and to generate more realistic images of the future consequences of climate change.

Since most of the natural events that can trigger technological hazards are influenced by climate change (i.e. flood, heavy rains, storms, etc.), NaTech risk is expected to be strongly increasing in the next years. However, dedicated NaTech planning actions and methods or tools to support them are still rarely available. The requirements of European Adaptation Strategy for Climate were examined considering the issues posed by the Seveso III Directive in terms of NaTech, focusing on the strategies adopted in the European countries, and in particular in Italy. Based on such analysis, a `NaTech tool' dedicated to local planners was developed. Practical and easy to use methods and procedures were proposed in order to allow the use of the method by the local authorities, in the absence of sectorial experts.

A case study from the Great Barrier Reef'	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Seagrass; Public perception; Climate change; Socio-ecological system; Great barrier reef; Willingness-to-pay; Science communication	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; NORTH QUEENSLAND; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; EXTINCTION; KNOWLEDGE; MESSAGES	Seagrass meadows, one of the world ' s greatest natural assets, are globally declining due to directanthropogenic (e.g., pollution, coastal development, run-off) and climate change (e.g., cyclones, floods, marine heatwaves) threats. One of the primary constraints in seagrass management and restoration is a lack of societal awareness about their role in the marine environment, their importance to human well-being, and their vulnerability. Public perception studies are useful tools to assess communities ' ecological knowledge and attitudes. The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), famous worldwide for its iconic coral reef, also hosts one of the world ' s largest areas of seagrass meadows, which provide many ecosystem services to the associated communities (e.g., nursery habitat, coastal protection, carbon sequestration etc.). However, the perception of seagrasses among coastal communities of the GBRWHA is poorly understood. Through an online survey of marine recreational users, we assessed public awareness of the role seagrasses play, its benefits, and threats to seagrasses in the GBRWHA, in comparison to coral reefs. Our results showed that there is an imbalance in perception of the role and ecosystem services provided by seagrasses and coral reefs among frequent visitors of the GBRWHA. Only 17% of respondents recognized 'seagrass' as a habitat of the GBRWHA. Ecosystem services from coral reefs were considered greater than from seagrasses (p < 0.05). Compared to previous studies, a higher percentage of participants believe in climate change (75%). Nevertheless, the general perception is that climate change impact magnitude is higher in coral reefs compared to seagrasses (p < 0.05). Additionally, climate change mitigation, a seagrass-related ecosystem service, was equally attributed to coral reefs and seagrasses (p > 0.05). Willingness-to-pay for coral reef restoration was higher than for seagrass (p < 0.05). For both marine habitats, willingness-to-pay for restoration was higher in younger people and participants with a university degree. Content analysis showed that people believe that marine habitats ' conservation/restoration can be achieved as a collective effort. On the other hand, a lack of trust in government actions was identified as a barrier to willingness-to-pay. These results confirm the need to raise awareness about the importance of seagrasses and of its vulnerability to climate change. To achieve that, we provide two key recommendations: to enhance purposeful experiences through citizen science and to increase effective scientific communication.

The global mitigation strategies that can be envisioned to reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere include retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient systems, increasing the dependency on renewable energy sources in lieu of fossil fuels, increasing the use of sustainable transportation systems that rely on electricity and biofuels, and adopting globally more sustainable uses of land and forests. To reduce global climatic changes, the excess amount of carbon dioxide in the environment needs to be captured and stored in deep underground sedimentary reservoirs. The sedimentary reservoirs that contain water in the rock matrix provide a more secure CO2 sequestration medium. The injection of carbon dioxide causes a huge increase in the reservoir pore pressure and provokes the subsequent ground uplift. The excessive increase in pore pressure may also cause leakage of carbon dioxide into the potable water layers and to the atmosphere, thus leading to severe global climatic changes. In order to maintain the integrity of the sequestration process, it is crucial to inject a safe quantity of carbon dioxide into the sequestration site. Accordingly, the injection period and the safe values of injection parameters, like flow rate and injection pressure, need to be calculated a priori to ensure that the stored carbon dioxide will not leak into the atmosphere and jeopardize the climate mitigation strategy. To model carbon dioxide injection in reservoirs having a base fluid, such as water, one has to perform a two-phase flow modeling for both the injected and base fluids. In the present investigation, carbon dioxide is injected into Biyadh reservoir, wherein the two-phase flow through the reservoir structure is taken into account. This investigation aims to estimate the safe parameter values for carbon dioxide injection into the Biyadh reservoir, in order to avoid leakage of carbon dioxide through the caprock. In this context, the two cases of a fractured and non-fractured caprock are considered. To ensure a safe sequestration mechanism, the coupled reservoir stability analysis is performed to estimate the safe values of the injection parameters, thus furnishing data for a reliable global climate change mitigation strategy. The obtained results demonstrated that the injection of carbon dioxide has caused a maximum pore pressure increase of 25MPa and a ground uplift of 35mm.

Geomorphic Controls on Floodplain Connectivity, Ecosystem Services, and Sensitivity to Climate Change: An Example From the Lower Missouri River	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						floodplain dynamics; geomorphology; fluvial; climate impacts; regional planning	MISSISSIPPI RIVER; UNITED-STATES; FLOW REGIME; DENITRIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; NITROGEN; LANDSCAPES; BASIN	Floodplains of large rivers are exploited for agricultural production, industrial and municipal development, and transportation infrastructure. Recently, increased frequency of costly floods has prompted consideration of whether offsetting benefits might accrue from management of floodplains for ecosystem services. We employed a simple inundation model for 800 km of the Lower Missouri River, USA, to evaluate spatial and temporal distributions of ecological floodplain inundation metrics and how those distributions might vary with levee removal and climatic change. The model evaluates inundation at 30 x 30 m resolution on a daily basis over 82 years of record. We quantified provisioning of waterfowl habitat and potential denitrification. Spatial variability is affected by ongoing geomorphic adjustments that affect floodplain connectivity. Statistical models indicate that available floodplain area and recent aggradation are predictive of most inundation metrics. Connectivity is sensitive to climate-change scenarios that predict increased floodplain inundation during spring waterfowl migrations; the greatest sensitivity to future climate exists where channel-floodplain geomorphology presently enhances floodplain connectivity. Evaluation of floodplain denitrification indicates that on average, the nonleveed part of the floodplain could denitrify 0.05%-1.7% of the mean annual nitrogen load of the river. Levee removal could increase this rate to only 3.6% of the nitrogen load. The capacity of floodplain connectivity to influence certain ecosystem services is highly variable in space along the Lower Missouri River and may be appreciably influenced by climate change. Hence, decisions to optimize management of large-river floodplains are likely to be highly location dependent.

J	Angra, D; Sapountzaki, K				Angra, Dimitra; Sapountzaki, Kalliopi			Climate Change Affecting Forest Fire and Flood Risk-Facts, Predictions, and Perceptions in Central and South Greece	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; forest fire risk; flood risk; public perception	CHANGE IMPACTS; WESTERN; SENSITIVITY; PROJECTIONS; VEGETATION	Global Climate change (CC) is featured by long-term changes in the mean values of climatic parameters (predominantly mean temperature) and in the profile of extreme weather events (e.g., increase in frequency, intensity, lengthening, and persistence). These climatic changes are supposed to have a deterioration impact on forest fire and flood disasters. Greece, an east Mediterranean country, is featured by a wide variety of micro-climates due to its unique geographical diversity, including hot and dry summers in the eastern part of the country (where a large amount of precipitation falls in the form of showers and thunderstorms) and wet winters in the western part. The combination of certain climatic zones with unfavorable land use and land cover changing patterns has resulted in several regions being prone to flooding and forest fires. The authors, based on relevant records, consider central and south Greece as flood and forest fire hotspots and attempt to: (a) present scientific estimations of local climate changes; (b) outline recent trends in the number of respective disasters and the amount of losses in these regions; (c) address recent changes in local climatic factors that might have influenced flood and forest fire hazard and risk in these regions; and (d) study the perceptions of the lay public and management authorities regarding the accountability of CC for flood and forest fire risk and hazard changes. The results show the variability of climate changes between neighboring areas, which directly affect the risk of forest fires and floods. Especially since the beginning of the 21st century, central Greece has been experiencing dramatic increases in both risks, while in south Greece the latter remain relatively stable. With regard to the perceptions of citizens and management authorities, the mental connection of local CC with forest fires and floods is still weak if not totally missing. Since knowledge and perceptions of the local "history" of forest fires and floods and the interconnections with CC by region is very important for the local communities to take appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures, this paper outlines a methodological path for similar studies to be conducted also in other regions of the Mediterranean basin and beyond.

The geoheritage degradation risk in protected areas of the Brazilian semi-arid coast was assessed using a quantitative method. A correlation with the tidal flooding hazard predicted with the climate change scenario was also considered for the study areas. The results show that most of the geosites assessed present a high risk of degradation due, mainly, to their exposure to negligence and inadequate public management regarding their uses. All geosites located in the plain areas are exposed to the risk of flooding by rising tides, which is associated with human action and leads to worrying scenarios regarding the loss of scientific and aesthetic values. The collected data support the need to rethink geoheritage management in protected areas and the mitigation of problems that may become major threats in conjunction with global climate change.

There exists, however, conflicting evidence for greater economic losses despite well acknowledged increases in the severity of observed extreme events in recent decades. Here, using a worldwide catastrophe insurance database from 1970 to 2015, we link the catastrophe economic loss from extreme storms and floods to local temperature. We find a statistically significant positive association between economic losses expressed as a proportion of GDP and local temperature. The association between economic losses and temperature is greater as the event becomes more extreme, with the signal muted for flooding as compared to storms. Although local associations of economic loss with temperature cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change, the positive economic loss-temperature associations are consistent with observed extreme precipitation-temperature associations, and hence pertinent to the advancement of understanding future natural catastrophes.

Quasi-Stationary Intense Rainstorms Spread Across Europe Under Climate Change	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						precipitation extremes; climate change; convection-permitting simulations; thunderstorm motion; ingredients-based approach; Arctic Amplification	FUTURE CHANGES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; VERTICAL VELOCITY; CONVECTIVE STORMS; ENVIRONMENTS; RAINFALL; INCREASE; CLOUD; MODEL; CIRCULATION	Under climate change, increases in precipitation extremes are expected due to higher atmospheric moisture. However, the total precipitation in an event also depends on the condensation rate, precipitation efficiency, and duration. Here, a new approach following an "ingredients-based methodology" from severe weather forecasting identifies important aspects of the heavy precipitation response to climate change, relevant from an impacts perspective and hitherto largely neglected. Using 2.2 km climate simulations, we show that a future increase in precipitation extremes across Europe occurs, not only because of higher moisture and updraft velocities, but also due to slower storm movement, increasing local duration. Environments with extreme precipitation potential are 7x more frequent than today by 2100, while the figure for quasi-stationary ones is 11x (14x for land). We find that a future reduction in storm speeds, possibly through Arctic Amplification, could enhance event accumulations and flood risk beyond expectations from studies focusing on precipitation rates.

This trend, combined with the transformation of the territory derived from diffuse anthropization processes, has created an explosive cocktail for many coastal towns due to flooding events. To evaluate this problem and the impact of its main guiding parameters, a geostatistical analysis of the territory based on GIS indicators and an NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis is developed. The assessment of the validity of a proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the Campo de Cartagena watershed located around the Mar Menor, a Mediterranean coastal lagoon in Southeastern Spain. This area has suffered three catastrophic floods derived from the DANA phenomenon between 2016 and 2019. The results show that apart from the effects derived from climate change, the real issue that amplifies the damage caused by floods is the diffuse anthropization process in the area, which has caused the loss of the natural hydrographic network that traditionally existed in the basin.

The region possesses a significant range of climate zones and habitats, and millions of people are beneficiaries of Himalayan ecosystem services. The Himalayan ranges encompasses over eight countries from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east passing through Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. Climate change is impacting the region, with dire consequences to sustainability of microhabitats and the services they provide. The recent devastating floods in Pakistan, for example, were likely worsened by the changing climate. A clear understanding of snow, ice and glacier dynamics in the Himalayas is limited. Socio-politically, the region is beset with border disputes. Researchers in the region cannot sustain the demand for their services and international assistance for regional research programmes is required. This could unlock vast sources of data that could be applied in multi-and trans -disciplinary work which could have a meaningful impact on the regions' people and the sus-tained provision of ecosystems. The Himalayas are good place for multidisciplinary research; we need to ensure that changes happening in the region and their impacts are monitored carefully. Trans-boundary co-operation should be implemented in both research and management outcomes for sustainability in the region. We outline the vision for the study and monitoring of climate change dynamics, trends, and impacts and its importance in achieving both political and natural resource sustainability in the Himalayas.

Spatial analysis of the benefits and burdens of ecological focus areas for water-related ecosystem services vulnerable to climate change in Europe	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Ecological focus areas; Ecosystem services; Water	LAND-USE; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; INDICATOR FRAMEWORK; COVER CROPS; SOIL; AFFORESTATION; CONSERVATION; IMPACTS; WETLANDS; NUTRIENT	There are many concerns regarding the effects of climate change including threats to ecosystem services. Rural land use can influence these services and there is scope for associated policies to steer decisions towards maximising benefits and minimising burdens. In Europe, for example, ecological focus areas (EFAs), introduced in the last reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, can have impacts on ecosystem services which vary with location, including potential trade-offs between benefits and burdens in some regions. This study combines the outputs from two continental-scale projects to provide a new perspective on the potential impact of EFAs for water-related ecosystem services under threat from climate change. An ecosystem service impact indicator framework was applied in conjunction with a climate change vulnerability assessment. This resulted in vulnerability and area weighted performance scores for dilution, filtration, water provision, and flood regulation services for 10 EFAs in 1256 regions. Best, average and worst case scenario maps were created that highlight the relative benefits and burdens of EFAs. Six EFAs have been identified which have not been activated in nine European Member States but which have potential to provide benefits. Eleven Member States have been identified which have regions where 3 EFAs should be avoided due to potential burdens. This analysis facilitates broad spatial targeting on a continental-scale of specific EFAs which may help maintain (and ideally increase) ecosystem service capacity and resilience in vulnerable regions.

Transportation infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme precipitation because it was designed using frequency, duration, and intensity relationships that do not represent future climate. Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of how future climate can disrupt roadways and bridges. This study proposes evaluating flood impacts on the transportation infrastructure with two novel metrics: the HFRR (roads) and HFRB (bridges). These metrics were based on the hydrological footprint residence (HFR), which represents the dynamics of the inundation area and its duration. The Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) one-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D) models were used to calculate the HFR metrics. These metrics were estimated for the transportation infrastructure of San Antonio, Texas, for 24-h 100- and 500-year storms for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Results show that climate change will increase flood impacts in the city. The new metrics presented a larger relative increase with climate change when compared to traditional metrics, such as maximum flooded areas. This study highlights the importance of using duration components to evaluate flood impacts on transportation infrastructure. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are vulnerable infrastructure and require the implementation of risk and safety analyses in the context of climate change and flooding. Therefore, making decisions in changing weather conditions is one of the most important but also most difficult tasks for operators to maintain proper management of wastewater infrastructure facilities. The aim of the research was to develop a decision-making tool based on soft sensor methods to allow inflows to be classified into two classes of WTTP operating conditions. The quality of the regression models was maintained at 90.0%, while the classifier based on the coarse decision tree had a testing accuracy of 92.4%. The results can contribute to a reduction in wastewater load, which is significant in the context of ongoing climate change, and to an improvement in WWTP operation through automation.

Resilience to drought of dryland wetlands threatened by climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GUM EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS; FLOODPLAIN-RIVER ECOSYSTEMS; MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; MACQUARIE MARSHES; WATER; CONNECTIVITY; VEGETATION; RECRUITMENT; INUNDATION; RESPONSES	Dryland wetlands are resilient ecosystems that can adapt to extreme periodic drought-flood episodes. Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.

In this study, the climate change impact on hydrology and morphology is assessed in the Chindwin River Basin, Myanmar. Future climate data was developed by an ensemble of four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) using a performance-based weight method, under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Two models were developed: a hydrological model (MIKE NAM) to simulate future discharge and a morphology model (MIKE 21 Flow Model) to simulate morphological changes under climate change scenarios. The results reveal that the mean annual discharge over the period from 2018 to 2040 (23 years) is projected to increase by 13.9 and 22.8%, under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The annual hydrograph shows a sharp rise and the recession of monsoon flood, with multiple peaks replacing the single peak observed during the baseline period (1975-2005) with a delay in peak of 8-10 days. The extreme events (floods) are expected to get more severe in the future in terms of frequency and magnitude compared to the baseline period. The study further shows that under extreme rainfall events, the left bank of the upstream areas is projected to experience severe morphological changes, accompanied by severe flood damage. As high flows become amplified due to climate change in the near future, morphological changes will exacerbate in the same period. Sediment deposition will increase the flood risk and river bank instability, constraining navigability in the river and adversely affecting riverine communities. The study reveals that mathematical modelling helps to identify the impacts of climate change on hydrology and morphology, and that knowledge coupled with an assessment of the vulnerability associated with lives and livelihoods, could help planners and policymakers to develop adaptation strategies and take meaningful action to mitigate the impact.

High demographic and economic pressures associated to climatic and environmental factors increase and intensify the vulnerability of these coastal areas. The latter are severely affected by climate change implications in the course of time, which lead to damage and loss in coastal low-lying zones. In practice, the risks related to climate change, as coastal risks, are frequently addressed, and assessing coastal risk in the context of climate change is a research priority. The aim of this work is to evaluate the flooding risk of TTA coasts, taking into account the inundation level related to the conditions of extreme wave (return period of 100-year) and extreme sea level rise. We firstly defined the coastal hazard zone that corresponds to the maximum inundation level of 13 m for the whole area. We then applied a Coastal Risk Index application at the Local Scale (CRI-LS) methodology to calculate forcing, vulnerability, exposure and risk indices using nineteen physical, environmental and socioeconomical variables. Findings show that coastal hazard zone of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region is extremely exposed to coastal forcing. More than 50% of the hazard zones indicates highly vulnerable zones and highest exposure is generally focused on the most populated urban zones. In the light of this, the coastal risk mapping shows hotspot zones in terms of climate change-related coastal risks located at Tangier Bay, south of Tangier city, Fnideq and Martil coasts, Tetouan city and north of Ksar El Kbir city. This paper corresponds to a useful support that can help policy-makers in decision-making to quietly follow coastal planning and management processes and participate in preserving coastal areas for future generations, which support the sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030 started by the United Nations with the goal of eradicating all kinds of poverty.

We suppose that a possible explanation for the species range shift is the climate change, since this can lead to changes in species distribution.

Global river water quality under climate change and hydroclimatic extremes	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review							DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; STREAM TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT IMPACTS; SURFACE; FLOOD; BASIN; NITROGEN; MODEL; URBANIZATION	Climate change and extreme weather events (such as droughts, heatwaves, rainstorms and floods) pose serious challenges for water management, in terms of both water resources availability and water quality. However, the responses and mechanisms of river water quality under more frequent and intense hydroclimatic extremes are not well understood. In this Review, we assess the impacts of hydroclimatic extremes and multidecadal climate change on a wide range of water quality constituents to identify the key responses and driving mechanisms. Comparison of 965 case studies indicates that river water quality generally deteriorates under droughts and heatwaves (68% of compiled cases), rainstorms and floods (51%) and under long-term climate change (56%). Also improvements or mixed responses are reported owing to counteracting mechanisms, for example, increased pollutant mobilization versus dilution during flood events. River water quality responses under multidecadal climate change are driven by hydrological alterations, rises in water and soil temperatures and interactions among hydroclimatic, land use and human drivers. These complex interactions synergistically influence the sources, transport and transformation of all water quality constituents. Future research must target tools, techniques and models that support the design of robust water quality management strategies, in a world that is facing more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes. Maintaining good water quality is vital for healthy ecosystems and human water use, yet water quality responses to hydroclimatic extremes and changing climate are poorly understood. This Review explores river water quality under climate change and extremes. River water quality is generally deteriorating under droughts and heatwaves (68% of case studies), rainstorms and floods (51%) and multidecadal historical and future climate change (56%), although improvements and mixed responses are also reported.Droughts and heatwaves result in lower dissolved oxygen and increased river temperature, algae, salinity and concentrations of pollutants (such as pharmaceuticals) from point sources owing to lower dilution. By contrast, low flow during these events leads to reduced pollutant transport from agricultural and urban surface runoff, contributing to lower concentrations.Rainstorms and floods generally increase the mobilization of plastics, suspended solids, absorbed metals, nutrients and other pollutants from agricultural and urban runoff, although high flow can dilute concentrations for salinity and other dissolved pollutants. The sequence of extreme events (such as droughts followed by floods) also impacts the magnitude and drivers of river water quality responses.Multidecadal climate change is causing water temperatures and algae to generally increase, partly causing a general decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Nutrient and pharmaceutical concentrations are mostly increasing under climate change, whereas biochemical oxygen demand, salinity, suspended sediment, metals and microorganisms show a mixture of increasing and decreasing trends.The main driving mechanisms for multidecadal water quality changes in response to climate change include hydrological alterations, rises in water and soil temperatures and interactions of hydroclimatic drivers with land use.

When local authorities discuss coastal management in a French Mediterranean region	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate policy; Coastal risk; Local scale; Social representation; Territorial development; France	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM XYNTHIA; BARRIERS; FLOOD; RESISTANCE; FRAMEWORK; PATHWAYS; AREAS	Adaptation to climate change is a critical issue in coastal areas, at risk from sea-level rise, erosion, and sea flooding. In territories strongly urbanized and long oriented toward tourism and a residential economy, a change in coastal management and territorial development is hard to initiate. In Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (France), a leading tourism region, this article explores how local authorities perceive climate change and talk about adaptation strategies. Interviews with municipal-level authorities, both elected officials and technical agents, reveal the influence of territorial inertia, with persistent statements promoting the beach- and residentialoriented economy and a wait-and-see attitude regarding climate change. Beach erosion is the only coastal risk interviewees really recognize, while sea-level rise and sea flooding are barely perceived. Yet evidence supporting the possibility of a future change in position is provided by the younger generation of interviewees, who are more aware of environmental challenges. Providing original data for a coastal region often considered as a model of development throughout the world, this article also proposes an original and transferable method combining geographical sampling of municipalities, text statistics and qualitative analysis of interviews, to apprehend the social representations of the coast, of climate change and coastal risks. Such a methodology is recommended prior to any quantitative assessment of climate action at local scale.

Sagar Island, the largest inhabited estuarine island of Sundarbans, is experiencing severe coastal erosion, frequent cyclones, flooding, storm surges, and breaching of embankments, resulting in land, livelihood, and property loss, and the displacement of people at a huge scale. The present study assessed climate change-induced vulnerability and risk for Sagar Island, India, using an integrated geostatistical and geoinformatics-based approach. Based on the IPCC AR5 framework, the proportion of variance of 26 exposure, hazard, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity parameters was measured and analyzed. The results showed that 19.5% of mouzas (administrative units of the island), with 15.33% of the population at the southern part of the island, i.e., Sibpur-Dhablat, Bankimnagar-Sumatinagar, and Beguakhali-Mahismari, are at high risk (0.70-0.80). It has been concluded that the island has undergone tremendous land system transformations and changes in climatic patterns. Therefore, there is a need to formulate comprehensive adaptation strategies at the policy- and decision-making levels to help the communities of this island deal with the adverse impacts of climate change. The findings of this study will help adaptation strategies based on site-specific information and sustainable management for the marginalized populations living in similar islands worldwide.

The traditional Darwinian approach for impact assessment of climate change and human activities mainly focuses on variations in annual streamflow, but ignores other critical streamflow characteristics (e.g., high- and low-flow signatures). In our study, seven streamflow metrics were adopted to characterize the main streamflow signatures including average, low and high flows, and the Budyko-based method was extended based on the derived differential equation of streamflow signature change to separate individual impacts of climate change and human activities. The Yellow River Basin, China was selected as the study area because of its high intensity of human activities, and daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region were used for the assessment. The assessment results were also compared with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method for validation. The results show that all streamflow signatures at the four stations have evidently declined after the 1980s, particularly for high-flow magnitudes. Both climate change and human activities decrease most of streamflow signatures, and human activities play major roles, which are gradually enhanced from the source region to the downstream region. The contributions of human activities are from - 66.85% to - 56.68% in the Tangnaihai controlled catchment, from - 96.93% to - 54.59% in the Qingtongxia controlled catchment, from - 83.61% to - 57.49% in the Longmen controlled catchment, and from - 91.02% to - 57.29% in the Lijin controlled catchment. The most impacted signature is the average flow in the non-flood season, followed by the annual maximum flow. The estimated contributions of climate change and human activities match well with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method, particularly for the high- and average-flow signatures with contribution deviations less than 10%. However, the estimated contributions to the low-flow signatures are quite different likely due to large uncertainty of low flow estimation. This study is expected to provide insights into the streamflow variations basin wide and provide scientific foundations for ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin, China.

In the study, a staged optimization model considering climate change and hydrological model uncertainty (SOCU) was proposed for urban drainage system design. The SOCU model refers to the construction of drainage system by stages instead of traditional implement-once plans, which was established based on an integration of staged optimization policy, urban hydrological model, generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method and chance-constrained programming (CCP) model. The staged optimization policy was employed to deal with the uncertainty of climate change. The GLUE method was adopted to analyze the uncertainty of urban hydrological model established by PCSWMM. Considering the uncertainty from urban hydrological simulation, the CCP model (one of the main methods of stochastic mathematical programming) was used to deal with the uncertainty of the optimization model. Subsequently, a case study of the Haidian Island of Hainan Province in China was used to demonstrate the proposed model. The result shows that the optimal investment is 183 million Yuan with a pumping capacity of 28.3 m(3)/s for the first stage and 38.4 m(3)/s for the next stage. The SOCU model is not only more flexible to adapt to climate change, but also is economically efficient (10% lower than implement-once plans). The urban drainage system design obtained from the SOCU model is more reliable and robust than traditional implement-once plans since the climate change and hydrological model uncertainty are simultaneously taken into account. Furthermore, the investment increases from 166 million Yuan to 195 million Yuan when the flood constraint satisfaction probability increases from 0.75 to 0.95. Therefore, the model could provide richer decision-making information than traditional implement-once plans and help decision makers seek a trade-off between system investment and acceptable flood damage. The study outcomes provide a reliable optimization model for urban drainage design and may have profound implications and contributions for urban flood management.

Consequently, climate change has become a significant focus of the scientific community. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) contain abundant water resources and is an area with intensive human activities; it is not only the center of social and economic development in China but also the region with the highest frequency of drought and flood disasters. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of several climate change indicators, including temperature, precipitation, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), in the MYRB during 1961-2017, using principal component analysis (PCA). The main results are as follows: (1) mean temperature, monthly air temperature sum, precipitation sum, maximum daily precipitation, and number of days with precipitation exceeding 30 mm were the primary variables that experienced variations in the MYRB; (2) the average temperature during spring and autumn and precipitation intensity in summer increased significantly in the MYRB, primarily in the east and the north. Increased aridity during spring, autumn, and winter was apparent in the MYRB; and (3) changes in the distribution of temperature and the intensification of drought were the principal variables that changed across the study period in the Hanjiang River Basin, while the dominant variables in Dongting Lake Basin and Yichang to Hukou Basin were precipitation regime and temperature-related indicators. The results of this study can improve our understanding of how climate change affects the MYRB, allowing the development of mitigation measures for meteorological disasters.

Nonetheless, few studies have focused on the spatial distributions of urban flooding characteristics and their variations in the context of climate change. In this study, eight critical metrics (i.e., maximum flooding volume, total overloaded manholes with different flooding volumes or durations, total flooding volume, mean and maximum flooding durations, maximum inundation area, and depth) are adopted to characterize the urban flood events. The impacts of climate change on these metrics are assessed for two periods, the 2030s (2020-2049) and 2070s (2060-2089), and compared with those in the baseline period (1976-2005). The Future Science City Park in Beijing, China, is selected as our study area. The results show that all four flood events are well simulated, with both efficiency coefficients and correlation coefficients being over 0.8. The number of overloaded manholes and the total flooding volume are projected to increase 19.3%-44.8% and 171%-716% under 20-year rainfall events due to climate change in the two future periods. The spatial distribution of overloaded manholes with different increased flooding volumes is projected to expand to almost the whole area from the region with lowland and limited drainage capacity. Furthermore, the maximum inundation area and depth are projected to increase obviously. This study will be helpful for designing and improving the drainage system, controlling urban flooding, and adapting to climate change.

Studying the adaptation to these phenomena requires taking into account the coping strategies (problem-focused or emotional-focused coping) implemented by the inhabitants of the exposed territories. A theoretical model of situational and dispositional factors determining these strategies has been proposed and tested empirically with 583 inhabitants of the island of Guadeloupe, which is exposed to said coastal flooding risk. The fit index confirms the adequacy of the model. The results indicate that coastal flooding risk perception, difficulties to regulate emotions, and place attachment predict avoidance coping. Vigilant coping is only predicted by perceived action efficiency. The roles of duration of residence and distance from the sea have been highlighted.

Therefore, a sensitivity analysis (i.e., a scenario-neutral approach) is used to examine the impacts of climate change on flooding in the Ba River Basin. A Delphi method with a set of KAMET rules was used to obtain a representative and a threshold flood event. These inputs are used for hydraulic simulation using a MIKE FLOOD model package. Flood simulations were performed using parametrically varied rainfall and temperature conditions. In total, 22 conditions were explored and are in line with CMIP5 and CMIP6. The results obtained have several implications. Firstly, rainfall change is the primary factor affecting flood impact in the Ba River Basin. Secondly, the flood peak in the Ba River Basin is highly sensitive to an increase in rainfall by up to 10%. Thirdly, the flooded threshold is reached when rainfall increases beyond 20%. Fourthly, the flood extent and depth are expected to increase as rainfall increases. Further research could improve the study using satellite rainfall data, satellite digital elevation models, and stochastic weather generators.

In a changing climate, forest management is expected to play a fundamental role by preserving the functioning of forest ecosystems and enhancing the adaptive processes. Understanding and quantifying the future forest coverage in view of climate changes is therefore crucial in order to develop appropriate forest management strategies. However, the potential impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems remain largely unknown due to the uncertainties lying behind the future prediction of models. To fill this knowledge gap, here we aim to provide an uncertainty assessment of the potential impact of climate change on the forest coverage in Italy using species distribution modelling technique. The spatial distribution of 19 forest tree species in the country was extracted from the last national forest inventory and modelled using nine Species Distribution Models algorithms, six different Global Circulation Models (GCMs), and one Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for 2050s under an intermediate forcing scenario (RCP 4.5). The single species predictions were then compared and used to build a future forest cover map for the country. Overall, no sensible variation in the spatial distribution of the total forested area was predicted with compensatory effects in forest coverage of different tree species, whose magnitude and patters appear largely modulated by the driving climate models. The analyses reported an unchanged amount of total land suitability to forest growth in mountain areas while smaller values were predicted for valleys and floodplains than high-elevation areas. Pure woods were predicted as the most influenced when compared with mixed stands which are characterized by a greater species richness and, therefore, a supposed higher level of biodiversity and resilience to climate change threatens. Pure softwood stands along the Apennines chain in central Italy (e.g.,Pinus,Abies) were more sensitive than hardwoods (e.g.,Fagus,Quercus) and generally characterized by pure and even-aged planted forests, much further away from their natural structure where admixture with other tree species is more likely. In this context a sustainable forest management strategy may reduce the potential impact of climate change on forest ecosystems. Silvicultural practices should be aimed at increasing the species richness and favoring hardwoods currently growing as dominating species under conifers canopy, stimulating the natural regeneration, gene flow, and supporting (spatial) migration processes.

Based on long-term observation datasets from the surrounding weather stations, regional mesoscale COSMO-CLM climate model results, and a detailed hydrological and water quality monitoring data, we performed a pioneer assessment of climate change and urbanization impact on flooding hazard and water quality of the urban Setun River as a case study. Statistically significant rise of some moderate ETCCDI climate change indices (R20mm and R95pTOT) was revealed for the 1966-2020 period, while no significant trends were observed for more extreme indices. The combined impact of climate change and increased urbanization is highly non-linear and results in as much as a fourfold increase in frequency of extreme floods and shift of water regime features which lead to formation of specific seasonal flow patterns. The rainstorm flood wave response time, involving infiltrated and hillslope-routed fraction of rainfall, is accounted as 6 to 11 h, which is more than twice as rapid as compared to the non-urbanized nearby catchments. Based on temporal trends before and after rainfall flood peak, four groups of dissolved chemicals were identified: soluble elements whose concentrations decrease with an increase in water discharge; mostly insoluble and well-sorted elements whose concentrations increase with discharge (Mn, Cs, Cd, Al); elements negatively related to water discharge during flood events (Li, B, Cr, As, Br and Sr); and a wide range of dissolved elements (Cu, Zn, Mo, Sn, Pb, Ba, La, Cs, U) which concentrations remain stable during rainfall floods. Our study identifies that lack of research focused on the combined impacts of climate change and urbanization on flooding and water quality in the Moscow urban area is a key problem in water management advances.

Stochastic Flood Risk Assessment under Climate Change Scenarios for Toronto, Canada Using CAPRA	WATER			English	Article						flood risk; climate change; exposure; vulnerability; Toronto; stochastic analysis; flood hazard; CAPRA	VULNERABILITY; DAMAGE; MODEL	Amongst all natural disasters, floods have the greatest economic and social impacts worldwide, and their frequency is expected to increase due to climate change. Therefore, improved flood risk assessment is important for implementing flood mitigation measures in urban areas. The increasing need for quantifying the impacts of flooding have resulted in the development of methods for flood risk assessment. The aim of this study was to quantify flood risk under climate change scenarios in the Rockcliffe area within the Humber River watershed in Toronto, Canada, by using the Comprehensive Approach to Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) method. CAPRA is a platform for stochastic disaster risk assessment that allows for the characterization of uncertainty in the underlying numerical models. The risk was obtained by integrating the (i) flood hazard, which considered future rainfall based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for three time periods (short-term: 2020-2049, medium-term: 2040-2069, and long-term: 2070-2099); (ii) exposed assets within a flood-prone region; (iii) vulnerability functions, which quantified the damage to an asset at different hazard levels. The results revealed that rainfall intensities are likely to increase during the 21st century in the study area, leading to an increase in flood hazards, higher economic costs, and social impacts for the majority of the scenarios. The highest impacts were found for the climate scenario RCP 8.5 for the long-term period and the lowest for RCP 4.5 for the short-term period. The results from this modeling approach can be used for planning purposes in a floodplain management study. The modeling approach identifies critical areas that need to be protected to mitigate future flood risks. Higher resolution climate change and field data are needed to obtain detailed results required for a final design that will mitigate these risks.

J	Giang, PQ; Vy, TT				Giang, Pham Quy; Vy, Tran Trung			Will Climate Change Exacerbate the Economic Damage of Flood to Agricultural Production? A Case Study of Rice in Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; modeling; rice production; flood economic loss; loss function; MRI-CGCM3; RCP8.5	IMPACTS; BASIN; MODEL	In developing countries in general and in Vietnam in particular, flood induced economic loss of agriculture is a serious concern since the livelihood of large populations depends on agricultural production. The objective of this study was to examine if climate change would exacerbate flood damage to agricultural production with a case study of rice production in Huong Son District of Ha Tinh Province, North-central Vietnam. The study applied a modeling approach for the prediction. Extreme precipitation and its return periods were calculated by the Generalized Extreme Value distribution method using historical daily observations and output of the MRI-CGCM3 climate model. The projected extreme precipitation data was then employed as an input of the Mike Flood model for flood modeling. Finally, an integrated approach employing flood depth and duration and crop calendar was used for the prediction of potential economic loss of rice production. Results of the study show that in comparison with the baseline period, an increase of 49.14% in the intensity of extreme precipitation was expected, while the frequency would increase 5 times by 2050s. As a result, the seriousness of floods would increase under climate change impacts as they would become more intensified, deeper and longer, and consequently the economic loss of rice production would increase significantly. While the level of peak flow was projected to rise nearly 1 m, leading the area of rice inundated to increase by 12.61%, the value of damage would rise by over 21% by 2050s compared to the baseline period. The findings of the present study are useful for long-term agricultural and infrastructural planning in order to tackle potential flooding threats to agricultural production under climate change impacts.

Therefore, identification and quantification of the driving factors of runoff variation have become a hot research area. This paper used the trend analysis method to show that runoff had a significant downward trend during the past 60 years in the Second Songhua River Basin (SSRB) of Northeast China. The upper, middle, and lower streams of five hydrological stations were selected to analyze the breakpoint of the annual runoff in the past 60 years, and the breakpoints were used to divide the entire study period into two sub-periods (1956-1974 and 1975-2015). Using the water-energy coupling balance method based on Choudhury-Yang equation, the climatic and catchment landscape elasticity coefficient of the annual runoff change was estimated, and attribution analysis of the runoff change was carried out for the Fengman Reservoir and Fuyu stations in SSRB. The change in potential evapotranspiration has a weak effect on the runoff, and change in precipitation and catchment landscape were the leading factors affecting runoff. Impacts of climate change and land cover change were accountable for the runoff decrease by 80% and 11% (Fengman), 17% and 206% (Fuyu) on average, respectively; runoff was more sensitive to climate change in Fengman, and was more sensitive to catchment landscape change in Fuyu. In Fengman, the population was small, owing to the comparatively inhospitable natural conditions, and so human activities were low. However, in Fuyu, human activities were more intensive, and so had more impact on runoff for the Lower Second Songhua River compared to the Upper Second Songhua River.

Here, using global flow data from non-urban catchments, we investigate the sensitivity of flood volume to changes in concurrent surface air temperature. We find most of the world shows decreases in flood volumes with increasing temperature. To understand why this correlation exists, we assess the sensitivity of the above result to mean daily temperatures (climate region), catchment size, and severity of the flood event. Our results indicate that most of the world shows decreases in flood volume with rising temperature for frequent events (50th percentile in this study) and a lesser decrease for rarer events. Changes in the flood volume in tropical regions show the greatest sensitivity to flood percentiles and catchment size. Large catchments in the tropics (> 1000 km(2)) have considerable sensitivities of flood volume with temperature at rates of-10 to-5%/ ? for frequent events (< 90th percentile) whereas small catchments (1000 km(2)) have sensitivities that only-5%/ ? or greater (i.e., less magnitude). On the other hand, when temperature increases, smaller catchments in the regions are likely to be exposed to more severe flooding at rates up to 15%/ ? for the most severe floods (99.99 percentile in this study) while the rate for large catchments approach zero. Although this study does not seek to find a causality between air temperature and flood runoff, the results suggest a possible decrease in water security with climate change, particularly in large tropical catchments.

Climate change is increasing pressure on wetlands, affecting their hydrology, and Mediterranean temporary ponds could be particularly vulnerable to these changes. We studied the expected changes in hydrology and plant community according to climatic change scenarios in 18 temporary ponds distributed in 6 areas along a latitudinal and climatic gradient in Morocco (750 km; 4 degrees latitudinal gradient). Richness of pond species was significantly correlated with water level and pond hydroperiod and showed a strong decline from north to south along with increased water stress. Using the Mar-O-Sel software (mar-o-sel.net), we simulated the future evolution of water balance and wetland hydroperiod (duration and frequency of flooding) in these ponds for mid- and late-21st century. Climate projections were estimated based on 2 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios assuming a stabilization (RCP4.5) or increase (RCP8.5) in greenhouse gas emissions. The mean water deficit of the ponds currently ranges between -1380 and -1812 mm/yr and would increase by 16-67% in 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenarios. Pond richness is expected to decrease by 8-15 species in 2100, depending on area, as a result of shorter projected hydroperiods. Severity of change was not related to location of the ponds along the latitudinal (aridity) gradient, but rather to the interaction between the size of their catchment area and the thickness of the permeable soil layer.

Insurance risk assessment in the face of climate change: Integrating data science and statistics	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Review						agricultural insurance; climate risk assessment; environmental statistics; home insurance; uncertainty quantification	BILLION-DOLLAR WEATHER; WINTER STORM LOSSES; INDEX; REGRESSION; IMPACT; YIELDS	Local extreme weather events cause more insurance losses overall than large natural disasters. The evidence is provided by long-term observations of weather and insurance records that are also a foundation for the majority of insurance products covering weather related damages. The insurers around the world are concerned, however, that the past records used to assess and price the risks underestimate the risk and incurred losses in recent years. The growing insurance risks are largely attributed to climate change that brings increasingly more alterations and permanent impact on all aspects of human life and welfare. From floods to hail to excessive wind, adverse atmospheric events are a poignant reminder of how vulnerable our society is across a broad range of threats posed by environmental extremes. Indeed, as climate change effects become more pronounced, we face a new era of risk with increasing weather related damages and losses. This in turn, coupled with challenges of massive climatic data, requires developing innovative analytic approaches that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries of statistical, actuarial and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, the multidisciplinary nature of climate risk assessment and its impact on insurance is often overlooked and neglected. We highlight the most recent developments and interdisciplinary perspectives on diverse statistical and machine learning methodology for modeling and assessing climate risk in agricultural and home insurances, with a particular focus on noncatastrophic events.

This allowance varies depending on the period for which the estimate is being made, the vulnerability of the development being considered and its location. Recently, questions have been raised as to whether these percentage uplifts should be kept the same, or whether change has already happened within the baseline period and so uplifts should be reduced. A complicating factor is that changes in flood frequency can occur for reasons in addition to climate change, such as land-use change or natural variability. This article describes current approaches taken by different stakeholders for catchments in England and Wales to account for climate change, and discusses these allowances where there is already an observed presence of trend in flood regimes. Theil-Sen estimators of trend were used in comparing non-stationary and stationary flood frequency curves with allowances applied, leading to a recommendation of evaluating non-stationary models at 1990, the end of the reference period. Examples were explored such as the Eden catchment, which was heavily affected by Storm Desmond in December 2015.

J	Heinz, N; Koessler, AK; Engel, S				Heinz, Nicolai; Koessler, Ann-Kathrin; Engel, Stefanie			Distance to climate change consequences reduces willingness to engage in low-cost mitigation actions-Results from an experimental online study from Germany	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONSTRUAL-LEVEL THEORY; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; INTERGROUP; RESPONSES; SEVERITY	Adverse consequences of climate change often affect people and places far away from those that have the greatest capacity for mitigation. Several correlational and some experimental studies suggest that the willingness to take mitigation actions may diminish with increasing distance. However, the empirical findings are ambiguous. In order to investigate if and how socio-spatial distance to climate change effects plays a role for the willingness to engage in mitigation actions, we conducted an online experiment with a German population sample (n = 383). We find that the willingness to sign a petition for climate protection was significantly reduced when a person in India with a name of Indian origin was affected by flooding, as compared to a person in Germany with a name of German origin. Distance did not affect donating money to climate protection or approving of mitigation policies. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a negative effect of distance to climate change consequences on the willingness to engage in low-cost mitigation actions. Investigating explanations for such an effect, we find that it can be attributed to the spatial rather than the social dimension of distance. Moreover, we find some cautious evidence that people with strong racist attitudes react differently to the distance manipulations, suggesting a form of environmental racism that could also reduce mitigation action in the case of climate change.

While scholars report climate change as a driver of armed conflict with marked inconsistencies, the ways conflict and terrorism exacerbate the impacts of climate change and stand as a barrier to reduce exposure to and risks associated with future stressors have received little attention. Here, we aim to understand how the Taliban-led conflict affected the capacities of people living in conflict zones to cope with one extreme climatic event, namely the devastating flood of 2010. Using key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household surveys, we develop an understanding of how the interlinkages between economics, culture, and politics, alongside deteriorating natural resources, accentuated land ownership disputes that led to the Taliban insurgency in Swat, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Province, Pakistan. Our findings reveal how the insurgency magnified the impacts of the 2010 flood and eroded rural livelihoods (e.g. farming and tourism) in the region. We demonstrate how existing and reproduced vulnerabilities alongside key stressors (i.e. armed conflict, the flood of 2010 and deforestation) became barriers to risk reduction. The study illustrates how these vulnerabilities, especially ownership disputes, and barriers to risk reduction can magnify the current and future risk environment. This case study highlights armed conflict as a contributing factor in the intensification of climate change impacts and associated extreme events.

This is particu-larly important for farmers who exploit fragile ecosystems such as marshlands.Using semi-structured questionnaires and interviews conducted with smallholder farmers in the marshlands of Kabare, this study compares the perception of men and women relating to climate change and uses the chi-square test and logistic regression to examine gendered differ-ences in response to climate change and the determinants of farmers' choice of sustainable practices. Meteorological data trends for three decades were also compared.Results showed that both men (77 %) and women (73 %) experienced climate change and this was illustrated by changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Farmers' climate change per-ceptions are consistent with the local historical climate data showing a slightly increasing trend of temperature and a decrease in rainfall for the last decade, particularly between 2013 and 2019. Although significant differences were observed between gender and sources of climate infor-mation (p < 0.05), 50 % of women farmers favored indigenous knowledge of climate, while 61 % of men farmers stated that experience exchange among fellow farmers helped to read and predict climate trends. The common impacts reported by farmers included the proliferation of pests (90 %), a decrease in soil fertility (75 %), and floods, resulting in crop failure. Farmers used various adaptation strategies in response to the perceived impacts. However, the choice of sustainable practices such as crop diversification, drainage, growing low-maintenance crops, and use of mulch and manure were associated with farmers 'experience, exchanging information among fellow farmers, livestock ownership, and the perception of climatic threats to crops. The infor-mation provided in this paper is valuable for the farmers' resilience-building program.

Adaptation, as a political response to this situation, interacts with longer trajectories of agrarian capitalism and peasant's expectations for the future. Through the concept of imagined transitions, this article explores how peasants of northern Colombia manufacture and project their own transition to an agrarian capitalist future in the aftermath of climate-related floods and in the midst of adaptation interventions. Peasants use adaptation to imagine a future in which they are no longer peasants but have instead become rural entrepreneurs who play a proactive role in the development of capitalism.

J	Kouser-Asif, S				Kouser-Asif, Salma			Extreme Flood Events in India and Attribution to Climate Change: An Analysis of News Media Coverage from 2013-2019 during Bihar Floods	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article						Floods; News media; Climate change; Disaster mitigation; Discourse analysis	PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS	This study analyzes the news media coverage of floods in a major flood-prone state of India, Bihar. Although news media helps shape public perception and political actions, little analysis of this means of communication has been conducted in India. Major topics and issues discussed during the coverage of Bihar floods in years 2013, 2017, and 2019 were provision of food, shelter, and health facilities, failure of the transportation system, waterlogging in urban areas, and failure or management of embankments. There was no skepticism on whether climate change was real. Political parties took contradictory positions: the ruling party attributed floods to a changing climate but other parties, and news media, emphasized the lack of disaster mitigation actions and were uninterested in climate change. This study suggests that it is more important to prepare for disaster mitigation actions around the major issues discussed and communicate them to the public. Media should become a major stakeholder by questioning the authorities about disaster preparations prior to the monsoon season and communicating mitigation actions to the public once disaster has struck, and help both public and government to better manage and mitigate the disaster.

J	Leandro, J; Chen, KF; Wood, RR; Ludwig, R				Leandro, Jorge; Chen, Kai-Feng; Wood, Raul R.; Ludwig, Ralph			A scalable flood-resilience-index for measuring climate change adaptation: Munich city	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Climate adaptation measures; Flood resilience analysis; Heavy rainfall; Urban areas	WATER; MANAGEMENT; ENSEMBLE; MODEL; STEP	Climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of rainfall extreme events worldwide. Despite the growing global awareness, developing flood resilient cities has proven to be a major challenge. This paper investigates the application of an event-based scalable Flood Resilience Index (FRI) for assessing climate change adaptation. Flood resilience is represented by three dimensions: physical, social and economic. A household climate adaptation is adopted consisting of a combination of a flood-proof gate with an indoor tank and a submersible pump system implemented in all houses. The climate related impact under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5) is analysed for Munich with the CRCM5 Large-Ensemble. Results show that for Munich extreme heavy rainfall events are increasing. The FRI can successfully identify households and districts which: a) are mostly affected by heavy rainfall, b) benefit the most from the climate adaptation, and c) are the most resilient. For the most severe future scenario investigated the climate adaptation measure was able to improve 57% of all affected buildings within Maxvorstadt to an FRI equal to 1.0 during the event and recovery phase.

J	Trinh, TT; Munro, A				Trinh, Tra Thi; Munro, Alistair			Integrating a choice experiment into an agent-based model to simulate climate-change induced migration: The case of the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam	JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING			English	Article						Climate change; Migration; Choice experiment; Drought and saline intrusion; Flood; Agent-based model; Vietnam; Mekong rivers	POPULATION MOBILITY; NATURAL DISASTERS; DESIGN; INTENTIONS; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; RISKS; FLOWS; FLOOD	Forecasting the future impact of climate change on migration is difficult, for many reasons, including the interactive and dynamic nature of many decisions and the heterogeneity of behavior. One popular solution, agent-based models (ABM) cope well with dynamics and het-erogeneity, but often lack rigorous foundations in terms of individual behavior. Moreover, given limited exposure to actual climate change, it can be a challenge to build adequate behavioral models of migration choice based on historical data. To tackle this issue, we build an ABM of future migration using a bespoke choice experiment (CE) designed to examine intention to migrate among farmers living in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). In the CE, respondents are asked to make migration choices for scenarios constructed using six attributes: drought intensity, flood frequency, income gain from migration, migration networks, neighbors' choice, and crop choice restriction. The simulation runs to 2050 and is based on two scenarios of future global emissions of greenhouse gases-Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5. The results suggest potentially high levels of migration as a result of climate change and the particular importance of positive feedback from pre-existing migration and neighbor's choices. The results also suggest that crop-restriction regulations have a significant impact on migration for coastal provinces of VMD. Finally, we find that migration drivers vary significantly across provinces, which suggests the policymakers point to targeted action for each province. In sum-mary, the study demonstrates how integrating CE into ABM can foster the predictive modeling of climate-induced migration.

Every year, heatwaves, floods and wildfires, bring death and devastation worldwide, increasing the evidence about the role of anthropogenic climate change in the increase of extremes. In this viewpoint article, we summarize some of the most recent extremes and put them in the context of the most recent research on atmospheric and climate sciences, especially focusing on changes in thermodynamics and dynamics of the atmosphere. While some changes in extremes are to be expected and are clearly attributable to rising greenhouse gas emissions, other seem counterintuitive, highlighting the need for further research in the field. In this context, research on changes in atmospheric dynamics plays a crucial role in explaining some of these extremes and more needs to be done to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms involved.

Insights in the impacts of climate change on maize yields and the potential to mitigate negative impacts by crop management are currently lacking for Zambia. Using five Global Circulation models and the WOFOST crop model, we assessed climate change impacts on maize yields at a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Impacts were assessed for the near future (2035-2066) and far future (2065-2096) in comparison with a reference period (1971-2001). The surface temperature and warm days (above 30 degrees C) are projected to increase strongly in the southern and western regions. Precipitation is expected to decline, except in the northern regions, whereas the number of wet days declines everywhere, shortening the growing season. The risk of crop failure in western and southern regions increases due to dry spells and heat stress, while crops in the northern regions will be threatened by flooding or waterlogging due to heavy precipitation. The simulated decline in the water-limited and water- and nutrient-limited maize yields varied from 15 to 20% in the near future and from 20 to 40% in the far future, mainly due to the expected temperature increases. Optimizing management by adjusting planting dates and maize variety selection can counteract these impacts by 6-29%. The existing gaps between water-limited and nutrient-limited maize yields are substantially larger than the expected yield decline due to climate change. Improved nutrient management is therefore crucial to boost maize production in Zambia.

Rising temperatures and extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, are causing crop failures and reducing yields. This study evaluated existing publications from 2006 to 2022, using the Web of Science database, Citespace, and the Bibliometrix package in R language for a systematic analysis. A total of 426 publications were identified, written by 1449 authors from 56 countries. The results showed that China has the highest share of publications (16.4%), followed by the United States (14.3%) and Australia (6.8%), with China and Pakistan collaborating most frequently. The keyword timeline analysis from 2006 to 2022 identified 11 clusters of research topics related to farmers' climate change risk (CCRF). Cluster #1, "water conservation measures," had the longest duration, highlighting its significance. Key areas of CCRF research include the vulnerability of land-lost farmers, farmers' use of meteorological information, sources of risk, barriers to implementing conservation agriculture, farmers' attitudes towards heavy metal pollution, and the use of protection motivation theory in agricultural adaptation. In conclusion, climate change poses significant threats to farmers, impacting crop yields, soil fertility, and water availability. Farmers adopt adaptation strategies, but effectiveness varies due to resource limitations and policy gaps. The research on farmer adaptation to climate change is growing, emphasizing the need for supportive policies, resources, and knowledge-sharing to achieve sustainable agriculture and food security.

High turbidity caused by abrupt flood, and drought caused by continuous dry days are the major risks. To assess such risks, a comprehensive method to simulate hydrology with high spatiotemporal resolution should be developed. In this study, a series of methods from parameter estimation to future simulation using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was demonstrated for Sagami Dam reservoir, which is a typical water supply reservoir in Japan. A proposed parameter calibration method by optimizing percent bias followed by optimizing Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency gave good performance of model prediction of the daily average reservoir inflow in the past. Using this model, the changes in inflow under expected climate change were simulated. Three predicted daily climates by the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 5 (MIROC5) under three representative concentration pathways, i.e., RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, in 2081-2100 were used for the simulation, whereas observed daily climate during 1981-2000 was used as the past reference. The risks were discussed by considering their seasonality, indicating increases in flood and drought in June and July, and in February and April, respectively.

This unique complex of ecosystems also plays a key role for Danube River and Black Sea fish fauna through its role as a natural safe buffer, shelter, feeding, reproduction, and smooth transitional area for a large number of fish species. Climate change is inducing a progressive sea level rise in the Black Sea, a fact that is expected to impact the delta's key complex and dynamic habitats, biocoenoses, and associated biota, and last but not least the key taxonomic group, namely, fish. Around one-third of the fish species of this delta will be greatly affected, sometimes negatively, by this climate change scenario, another one-third to a lesser extent, and the final one-third not at all. The ecological positive feedback of fish can stimulate environmental change and is expected to be responsible for changes within Danube Delta ecosystems, and also for the near Danube River and Black Sea diverse matrix of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Sea level rise in the Black Sea is considered to have been one of the main stress factors of the Danube Delta fish fauna in the past, and is likely to be the case in the future. In this spatio-temporal dynamic context, for the fish species under threat and risk, in situ-adapted management measures are highly required. The current work brings for the first time such a prospective knowledge about the potential impact on Danube River-Danube Delta-Black Sea coast fish diversity in the potential climate change-sea level rise scenario.

Recently, flood events have become more disastrous as their frequency and magnitude have increased due to climate change. This situation is further worsened due to the limited capacity of existing water reservoirs and their ability to absorb and mitigate peak floods. Thus, the simulation of stream flows using projected data from climate models is essential to assess flood events and proper water resource management in the country. This study investigates the future floods (in near future and far future periods) using the integrated flood analysis system (IFAS) model under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios. Downscaled and bias corrected climatic data of six general circulation models and their ensemble were used in this study. The IFAS model simulated the stream flow efficiently (R-2 = 0.86-0.93 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.72-0.92) in the Jhelum River basin (JRB), Kabul River basin (KRB), and upper Indus River basin (UIRB) during the calibration and validation periods. The simulation results of the model showed significant impact of projected climate change on stream flows that will cause the mean monthly stream flow in the JRB to be lower, while that of the KRB and UIRB to be higher than that of the historical period. The highest flow months are expected to shift from May-June (Jhelum basin) and June-July (Kabul basin) to April-May with no changes in the UIRB. Higher frequencies of low to medium floods are projected in the KRB and UIRB, while the JRB expects fewer flood events. Based on the results from the IFAS model, it is concluded that stream flow in the study area will increase with several flood events.

While large ensembles are available to assess future impacts (e.g., the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP) and/or CORDEX) many countries have developed their own high-resolution ensembles. This poses a selection problem with robust adaptation dependent on plausible ranges of change being adequately quantified. Therefore, it is important to compare projected changes from available ensembles. Here we assess future climate change impacts for 26 Irish catchments. Using a high-resolution national ensemble of climate models projected impacts in mean, low and high flows are assessed and uncertainties in future projections related to catchment size. We then compare future impacts from CORDEX and CMIP6 ensembles for a subset of catchments. Results suggest increases in winter flows (-3.29 to 59.63%), with wide ranges of change simulated for summer (-59.18 to 31.23%), low (-49.30 to 22.37%) and flood (-19.31 to 116.34%) flows across catchments under RCP8.5 by the 2080s. These changes would challenge water management without adaptation. Smaller catchments tend to show the most extreme impacts and widest ranges of change in summer, low and flood flow changes. Both the ensemble mean and range of changes from the national ensemble were more modest and narrower than the CMIP6 and CORDEX ensembles, especially for summer mean and low flows, highlighting the importance of evaluating impacts across ensembles to ensure adaptation decisions are informed by plausible ranges of change.

A high demand for fish prevails in the region as 90-100% of the population prefers fish in their daily diet. The region faces climate change-related issues at various levels and with a range of impacts on the inland fisheries sector. The period 1951 to 2010 saw a significant increase in annual mean temperature in several states of the region (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, Mizoram, and Tripura). The highest increase in annual mean temperature was recorded in Sikkim (+0.05 degrees C yr(-1)) followed by Manipur (+0.03 degrees C yr(-1)). Significant changes in annual rainfall pattern were also recorded during the same time period in the region: four of the eight states (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Nagaland) experienced a decreasing trend, and the remaining four (Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, and Mizoram) an increasing trend. The highest increase in annual rainfall was recorded in Meghalaya (+14.68 mm yr(-1)) during this period. The change in seasonal trend of mean temperature and the erratic rainfall pattern in the region have had profound impacts on the traditional fisheries of the region. This study outlines these impacts and suggests potential adaptation actions that may be implemented to cope with climate change.

As a consequence of these changes, several climate models forecast an intensification of extreme weather events over the upcoming decades, including heat waves and increasingly severe drought and flood episodes. The occurrence of such extreme weather will prompt profound changes in several plant communities, resulting in massive forest dieback events that can trigger a massive loss of biodiversity in several biomes worldwide. Despite the gravity of the situation, our knowledge regarding how extreme weather events can undermine the performance, survival, and distribution of forest species remains very fragmented. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide a broad and integrated perspective of the main biochemical, physiological, and morpho-anatomical disorders that may compromise the performance and survival of forest species exposed to climate change factors, particularly drought, flooding, and global warming. In addition, we also discuss the controversial effects of high CO2 concentrations in enhancing plant growth and reducing the deleterious effects of some extreme climatic events. We conclude with a discussion about the possible effects that the factors associated with the climate change might have on species distribution and forest composition.

Individuals and households can take adaptation actions to help limit the severity of harm caused when climate impacts occur, for example, they could make adjustments to their homes such as installing flood gates or sun shades, or they could adapt their behavior such as staying indoors during the hottest part of the day. However, so far adaptation is not yet happening at the speed or scale needed to adequately prepare for the climate impacts already being experienced or those projected for the coming decades. Here, we propose an agenda for future social science research that would further our understanding of how best to increase engagement and action in climate change adaptation.

The framework is demonstrated on Greater London, UK, with a set of future population and land-use scenarios being tested against flood risk under climate change. The framework is developed in Python using open-source databases and is designed to be transferable to other cities worldwide.

The alteration of the climate in a specific region affects the life of indigenous animals and humans. The climate changes influence living beings both directly and indirectly. The immune system of animals dramatically suffers the climate instability, making animals more susceptible to infectious and not infectious diseases. Different species of livestock animals respond with similar mechanisms to global warming, but some of them are more susceptible depending on their age, metabolism, and genetic conditions. The selection and study of autochthonous species and breeds, more easily adapted to specific environmental conditions could be an interesting strategy to face livestock rearing in the future.

GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article							SOUTH PADRE ISLAND; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; TRENDS; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; DUNEFIELDS; VEGETATION; EROSION; BARRIER; TESTS	In the context of global climate change and sea-level rise, coastal dunes are often important elements in the coastal response to storm wave and storm surge impacts on coastal lowlands. Vegetation cover, in turn, has profound impacts on coastal dune morphology and storm-buffering function; it binds existing sediment, promotes fresh sediment accumulation and thereby increases dune volume and dune crest elevation where a sediment-plant interaction plays out with vegetation growth attempting to out-pace the vertical sediment accumulation. A global analysis shows that vegetation cover has increased substantially on multiple, geographically dispersed, coastal dune fields on all continents in the period 1984-2017. The observed 'greening' points to enhanced dune stability and storm buffering effects at a time when, paradoxically, coasts are being subjected to increased flood and erosion risk from rising sea levels and changing patterns of storminess. Causal attribution of biological trends to climate change is complicated, but we contend that the global scale 'greening' of coastal dunes is driven by a combination of changes to climate and atmospheric composition and reflects the cumulative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, nutrient concentration and reduced windiness (global stilling). Global-scale increases in temperature, nutrients and precipitation (all of which are vegetation growth stimulants) and widespread reduction in windiness ("stilling") (which reduces sediment activity, promoting the spread of vegetation) coincide in time with the observed changes in vegetation cover. The observed changes in coastal dunefields enhance contemporary and near-future coastal resilience to climate change and may represent a previously unrecognised morphological feedback mediated by climate change.

Current greenhouse gas emission trends point to much more substantial warming, with possible increases of 4 degrees C or more in the long-term. This Special Issue describes findings from the IMPRESSIONS project which advanced the understanding of impacts of high-end climate change (defined as global mean temperatures >2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels) and potential solutions for reducing these impacts through adaptation, mitigation and transformative actions. With stakeholders, the project developed a set of integrated climate and socio-economic scenarios and applied these to multi-sectoral impact models in five case studies: Hungary, Scotland, Iberia, Europe as a whole and Central Asia. This showed that benefits in some regions and sectors, such as increasing forest productivity in northern Europe, are offset by detrimental effects in others, such as severe water scarcity, heat stress and loss of productivity in southern Europe and parts of central and eastern Europe, and widespread flood damage. Adaptation and mitigation pathways were generated with stakeholders to address these impacts and identify integrated and transformative solutions. These highlighted the importance of shifting to sustainable lifestyles, good governance for sustainability and climate resilience, and new forms of integrated and sustainable resource management. The stakeholder-led approach of IMPRESSIONS ensured that the research was driven by the priorities of decision-makers, enabling significant co-learning and the identification of robust, innovative and effective solutions for addressing high-end climate change.

J	Bromhead, H				Bromhead, Helen			Disaster linguistics, climate change semantics and public discourse studies: a semantically-enhanced discourse study of 2011 Queensland Floods	LANGUAGE SCIENCES			English	Article						environmental discourse; extreme weather events; flood; Natural Semantic Metalanguage; ethnopragmatics; semantically-enhanced discourse studies; Australian public discourse; disaster linguistics; climate change semantics; public discourse studies	RESILIENCE	Natural disasters, such as what are known in English as 'floods' and 'wildfires', are increasingly a topic of concern due to the climate emergency, and their vocabulary and public discourses hold much to be explored through linguistics. This article inaugurates the examination of public discourse about extreme weather events through semantically enhanced discourse studies, an approach which is based on Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) and developed herein. Taking the example of floods in the particular geographic, cultural and historical environment of the Australian state of Queensland in 2011, this transtextual study draws on a public inquiry into the event and English as spoken in Australia, more broadly, along with media reports, and literature from humanities and social sciences. Five case studies of vocabulary and discourse patterns are presented to cast cultural and semantic spotlights on the public discourses. It is demonstrated that this approach can provide high resolution analysis of discourse and bring out cultural and historical factors at play in extreme weather language thereby contributing to disaster linguistics, climate change semantics and public discourse studies.

Because the water resource sector is closely related to human activities and affected by interactions between the humanities and social sciences, there is a need for interdisciplinary research that can consider various elements, such as society and the economy. This study elucidates relationships within the social and hydrological systems and quantitatively analyzes the effects of a multi-purpose dam on the target society using a system dynamics model. A causal loop was used to identify causal relationships between the social and hydrological components of the target area, and a simulation model was constructed using the system dynamics technique. Additionally, climate change and socio-economic scenarios were applied to analyze the future effects of the multi-purpose dam on population change, the regional economy, water use, and flood damage prevention in the target area. The model proved reliable in predicting socio-economic changes in the target area and can be used to make decisions about efficient water resource management and water-resource-related facility planning.

However, migration also carries risks and costs, such that vulnerability may not be reduced. This article constructs an index of rural households' vulnerability to extreme weather events, in order to explore how key components of vulnerability relate to migration. Applied to case studies in China and India, the study finds that the effect of remittances is non-linear. Although overall, in Assam, few differences were found in the vulnerability of households that did and did not receive remittances, in Yunnan, remittance-recipient households were found to have less adaptive capacity in response to drought. However, those who had received remittances over longer periods were found to have improved adaptive capacity in both case studies, and in Yunnan, their exposure to such events was also lower. Meanwhile in Assam, longer distance migration was associated with reduced exposure to flooding and with specific forms of adaptation. The vulnerability index developed has capacity to be used in assessments of effects of migration on vulnerability elsewhere.

J	Green, B; Strong, C				Green, Ben; Strong, Catherine			'What if it rains? What if there are bushfires?': Extreme weather, climate change and music festivals in Australia	MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; extreme weather; music festivals; popular music	FUTURE	Increasingly, music festivals in Australia are being cancelled, postponed or otherwise impacted by extreme weather events, including floods throughout 2022 and bushfires in 2018-2019. These and other forms of extreme weather, such as dangerous heat and drought, are predicted to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change. However, relative to the size of the problem, there is a lack of attention in both public discussion and scholarly literature to the impacts of extreme weather and climate change on the festival sector, and the need to adapt in response. This study explores this issue in the context of Australian music festivals. The threat of extreme weather to the Australian music festival sector and its benefits is outlined, with reference to climate science predictions as against known festival activity, as well as a detailed overview of recent impacts. This is followed by an examination of how music festival stakeholders in industry and government are responding to this challenge, through the analysis of policy submissions, media comments and changes of practice. This article concludes by proposing a set of questions and issues for research, policy and action concerning the escalating impact of extreme weather on music festivals in Australia, with relevance to other places.

Although studies find that climate changemight increase global inequality by widening disparities across countries, its effects on within-country income distribution have been little investigated, as has the role of rainfall anomalies. Here, we show that extreme levels of precipitation exacerbate within-country income inequality. The strength and direction of the effect depends on the agricultural intensity of an economy. In high-agricultural-intensity countries, climate anomalies that negatively impact the agricultural sector lower incomes at the bottom end of the distribution and generate greater income inequality. Our results indicate that a 1.5-SD increase in precipitation from average values has a 35-times-stronger impact on the bottom income shares for countries with high employment in agriculture compared to countries with low employment in the agricultural sector. Projections with modeled future precipitation and temperature reveal highly heterogeneous patterns on a global scale, with income inequalityworsening in high-agricultural-intensity economies, particularly in Africa. Our findings suggest that rainfall anomalies and the degree of dependence on agriculture are crucial factors in assessing the negative impacts of climate change on the bottom of the income distribution.

It is believed that these phenomena will intensify in the long-term, and that sewage systems will be overloaded with stormwater. Consequently, cities will need more opportunities to protect themselves from flooding. Moreover, longer periods of drought will increase the temperatures in towns. The use of blue and green infrastructure is being used to adapt to climate change and to limit its effects in cities. However, it is important not to apply these solutions indiscriminately. They have obvious advantages, but are also limited in their uses. Facilities are also being developed for the design and construction of green infrastructure. This article presents the benefits of using rain gardens in urban spaces and in relation to other forms of blue-green infrastructure; it also explored the problems that may occur while using them. More important facilitations in the implementation of rain gardens into urban fabrics are discussed, particularly in the context of the existing inconveniences. A holistic approach to the issue was applied addressing technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects.

Gonzalez			Measuring the Impact of Infectious Diseases on Tourists' Willingness to Pay to Visit Island Destinations	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						tourism; climate change; islands; infectious diseases; adaptation; resilience; blue growth	SCALE-PERCEPTION BIAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VALUATION	The occurrence of infectious diseases may change tourists' perceptions of a destination's image and value. This article proposes and empirically tests a choice model to measure the effect of the risk of infectious disease outbreaks caused by climate change on tourists' willingness to pay for holidays to island destinations. With this aim, an online survey was administrated to 2538 European frequent travellers at their country of residence. Tourists were presented with a hypothetical situation whereby they had to choose among eleven well-known European island destinations for their next holiday. The choice cards included the probability of the occurrence of infectious disease events in the context of other potential risks caused by climate change (i.e., forest fires, floods, heat waves, etc.). The results show infectious disease is the risk that more negatively affects tourists' willingness to pay to visit islands, followed by forest fires. The results have implications for tourism policy, highlighting the importance of prevention and response strategies, and the design of climate-oriented services, which may raise opportunities to work towards the enhancement of those health and environmental conditions of tourist destinations that ensure their sustainability in the longer term.

While the large majority of individuals do not hold consistent opinions on climate issues, we argue that the experience of natural disasters can prime voters on climate change and affect political behavior. Using micro-level geospatial data on natural disasters, we exploit referendum votes in Switzerland, which allows us to obtain a behavioral rather than attitudinal measure of support for policies tackling climate change. Our findings indicate a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood: vote-share supporting pro-climate policies can increase by 20 percent. Our findings contribute to the literature exploring the impact of local conditions on electoral behavior.

Future climate change projections indicate that the frequency and intensity of extreme sea levels (ESL) will increase, putting several port facilities at risk of flooding with impacts on the port's reliability and operability. The northwest Iberian Peninsula (NWIP) coast is crossed by one of the most important and busiest shipping lanes in the Atlantic Ocean and features several ports that provide an essential gateway to Europe. In this context, the main aim of this study is to present a review of the extent of flooding under future climatic scenarios in selected NWIP ports, considered representative of the diversity of the coastal areas in this region. The ports of Aveiro (lagoon), Lisbon (estuary), Vigo (Ria) and A Coruna Outer Port (marine) are considered in this study due to their location in different coastal environments, which brings distinct challenges related to climate change local impact. For each port area, the risk of flooding was assessed under climate change scenarios using CMIP5 RCP8.5 for the climate periods between 1979-2005, 2026-2045 and 2081-2099, considering the return periods of 10, 25 and 100 years for storm surges, riverine input and wave regime. The flood pattern varies significantly according to the location of the ports. The ports in lagoons and estuaries are more prone to floods by ESL due to their location in low and flat topography regions. Rias, with a funnel-shaped valley and irregular topography, make the ports in this environment resilient to a sea level rise. Marine environments are exposed to harsh oceanic drivers, however, the ports in these areas are usually built to withstand significant wave conditions with return periods of a hundred years, making them resilient to climate change impacts.

In this study, a methodology is proposed to investigate future rainfall extremes using future surface air temperature (SAT) or dew point temperature (DPT). The non-stationarity of rainfall extremes is reflected through non-stationary frequency analysis using SAT or DPT as a co-variate. Among the parameters of generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, the scale parameter is applied as a function of co-variate. Future daily rainfall extremes are projected from 16 future SAT and DPT ensembles obtained from two global climate models, four regional climate models, and two representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios. Compared with using only future rainfall data, it turns out that the proposed method using future temperature data can reduce the uncertainty of future rainfall extremes outputs if the value of the reference co-variate is properly set. In addition, the confidence interval of the rate of change of future rainfall extremes is quantified using the posterior distribution of the parameters of the GEV distribution sampled using Bayesian inference.

Our study aimed at establishing the role of small floodplain reservoirs in the eutrophication processes, in the face of recent climate changes. The content of phosphorus and nitrogen compounds was determined in sediments and water of small floodplain reservoirs, (the Vistula River Valley, Poland) using spectrophotometric and Kjeldahl's method. Nutrient loads in sediments were linked to the texture and total organic carbon content. Seasonal changes in water quality were strictly connected to changing weather conditions, flood and drought. The concentrations of PO43- and NO3- were found to rise after summer flooding. Increases in NH4+, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were correlated with the surface water area reduction in the reservoirs, which during the year of the study was on average 62%. Therefore, small floodplain reservoirs could be considered simultaneously as sinks and sources of nutrients. On the one hand, they accumulate P and N compounds carried by the river during the flood. On the other hand, climate change cause that small floodplain reservoirs may be responsible for enhanced biomass production.

Environmental stress is measured using historical cyclone impacts, salinization, and land loss from erosion. Household migration decisions are based on current and expected future income streams in different locations. Rising environmental damage raises costs, but it may also induce increased public assistance that moderates or neutralizes those costs, diminishing migration incentives, even in areas hard-hit by climate change. Econometric estimates for the Sundarbans region shared by India and Bangladesh suggest that endogenous public assistance strongly dampens the migration response to rising environmental stress in both countries, though the assistance response and migration dampening are lower in Bangladesh. A broader analysis for the coastal region from India's Odisha State to eastern Bangladesh finds that present and past cyclone impacts are highly significant for explaining coastal population changes, although responses are lower in India because of lower environmental stress and greater public-assistance intensity. A counterfactual simulation suggests that, as a result of cyclones since 1970, the affected regions are 8-10% less populous in Bangladesh but only 2% less populous in India. The paper's findings motivate a discussion of the implications for alternative policy regimes as land erosion increases, and sea-level rise and salinization continue with climate change. After comparing the efficiency and equity of regimes that provide universal damage compensation or leave coastal households to fend for themselves, the paper suggests an alternative approach that focuses public resources on compensation for households that choose to relocate as the coastal threat mounts.

J	Evans, AM				Evans, Angela Margaret			Sustainable healthcare - Time for 'Green Podiatry'	JOURNAL OF FOOT AND ANKLE RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Healthcare; Carbon; Greenhouse; Podiatry; Emissions		Background Healthcare aims to promote good health and yet demonstrably contributes to climate change, which is purported to be 'the biggest global health threat of the 21st century'. This is happening now, with healthcare as an industry representing 4.4% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Main body Climate change promotes health deficits from many angles; however, primarily it is the use of fossil fuels which increases atmospheric carbon dioxide (also nitrous oxide, and methane). These greenhouse gases prevent the earth from cooling, resulting in the higher temperatures and rising sea levels, which then cause 'wild weather' patterns, including floods, storms, and droughts. Particular vulnerability is afforded to those already health compromised (older people, pregnant women, children, wider health co-morbidities) as well as populations closer to equatorial zones, which encompasses many low-and-middle-income-countries. The paradox here, is that poorer nations by spending less on healthcare, have lower carbon emissions from health-related activity, and yet will suffer most from global warming effects, with scant resources to off-set the increasing health care needs. Global recognition has forged the Paris agreement, the United Nations sustainable developments goals, and the World Health Organisation climate change action plan. It is agreed that most healthcare impact comes from consumption of energy and resources, and the production of greenhouse gases into the environment. Many professional associations of medicine and allied health professionals are advocating for their members to lead on environmental sustainability; the Australian Podiatry Association is incorporating climate change into its strategic direction. Conclusion Podiatrists, as allied health professionals, have wide community engagement, and hence, can model positive environmental practices, which may be effective in changing wider community behaviours, as occurred last century when doctors stopped smoking. As foot health consumers, our patients are increasingly likely to expect more sustainable practices and products, including 'green footwear' options. Green Podiatry, as a part of sustainable healthcare, directs us to be responsible energy and product consumers, and reduce our workplace emissions.

Assessing resilience of a dual drainage urban system to redevelopment and climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban stormwater; Land use change; Climate change; Redevelopment; Infill development; Resilience assessment	LAND-USE CHANGE; STORMWATER; IMPACTS; DESIGN; INFRASTRUCTURE; CHALLENGES; HYDROLOGY	Dual drainage systems in urban areas were historically designed and built to convey certain size storms on the assumption of stationarity. However, changes to rainfall due to climate change and increases in impervious cover due to land use change, specifically redevelopment, violate this assumption. Hydrologic models can be used to quantify impacts of climate and land use changes on stormwater runoff. Uncertain climate projections can complicate modeling efforts using "predict-then-adapt" strategies. Therefore, this study used the opposite approach in a "tipping point" resilience assessment. We determined the changes in rainfall (from climate change) and changes in land cover (from redevelopment) that pushed a dual drainage stormwater system to exceed regulatory flooding standards. Then, adaptive measures (bioretention cells) were added to improve system resilience to handle wider changes in climate or land use. We performed this assessment for a redeveloping urban neighborhood in Denver, Colorado and tested regulatory flooding standards for both minor (5-yr) and major (100-yr) storm events at different levels of redevelopment. We found that the pre-redevelopment system exceeds acceptable minor event standards and floods streets (i.e., reaches a tipping point) at an increase in rainfall of 7% due to climate change. It was also found that impervious areas can be increased by redevelopment up to 8.1% before exceeding minor storm event standards under current rainfall conditions, suggesting similar stormwater quantity impacts from both climate and land use changes. Adding distributed bioretention units in redeveloped areas allows for up to an additional 12.5% and 8.5% absolute increase in rainfall before the stormwater system fails minor and major storm event standards, respectively. Given the wide range of climate change estimates for future rainfall conditions, redevelopment presents a unique opportunity for implementing green stormwater infrastructure and building system resilience.

There have been calls for a more coordinated approach to planning for current and future flood risks, but is planning rising to the challenge? We apply the Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) methodology to spatially evaluate policies that would impact physical vulnerability to flooding in the network of different city plans that shape land use and steer development in Boston, MA and Fort Lauderdale, FL. Unlike previous applications of this approach, we look at how the plan network is changing over time. Between 2015 and 2019, attention on climate change grew in both cities, as did the number of plans and policies across the network with the potential to decrease physical vulnerability. New types of plans, such as climate change adaptation plans, play an important role in reducing flood risks. However, plans perpetuate past disparities in policy attention. As the first study to analyze how city networks of plans and their potential impact on resilience evolve over time, this work has important implications for planning scholarship and practice as well as hazard and climate change governance more broadly.

J	Twinomuhangi, R; Sseviiri, H; Kato, AM				Twinomuhangi, Revocatus; Sseviiri, Hakimu; Kato, Arthur Martin			Contextualising environmental and climate change migration in Uganda	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; environmental degradation; livelihoods; displacement; migration	LANDSLIDE DISASTER; ADAPTATION; FOREST; POLICY; RISK	The complex linkage between environment, climate change and migration is increasingly capturing global debate. Uganda faces widespread environmental degradation and high vulnerability to climate change impacts that cause livelihood hardships, inducing human mobility. However, the environment, climate change and migration nexus is not well understood and documented, although advocacy to address the livelihood challenges associated with environmental and climate-induced migrations is on the rise. This paper addresses this knowledge gap and presents findings from a review of literature, complemented by key informant interviews and group discussions conducted in the Karamoja, Mt. Elgon and Teso sub-regions of Uganda. The findings show that some socio-economic hardships that cause migrations like natural resources scarcities (water, pastures and fertile soils), hunger and food insecurity and conflicts are linked to slow-onset processes/events related to environmental degradation, rising temperatures and desertification, compounded by sudden-onset events/disasters including; drought, rainstorms, flooding and landslides, that threaten livelihood security and trigger voluntary and forced migrations. Migration also occurs as a coping strategy to environment and climate shocks and stresses. However, empirical research evidence on the numbers of people who have migrated because of environmental change or climate change is still lacking as more research focus has been on the socio-economic and political drivers of migration. Deeper empirical research that incorporates spatial analyses on how the environmental and climate parameters induce migrations is necessary to provide an evidence base to inform transformative policy processes and actions that address human mobility challenges and build resilient societies in Uganda.

J	Bai, Y; Zhang, ZX; Zhao, WG				Bai, Ye; Zhang, Zhenxing; Zhao, Weiguo			Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Flood Events Using HEC-HMS and CMIP5	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						Climate change; Flood; HEC-HMS; Hydrologic model; CMIP; CORDEX	RIVER-BASIN; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES	Climate change may result in increased variability in rainfall intensity in the future, leading to more frequent flooding and a substantial loss of lives and properties. To mitigate the impact from flooding events, flood control facilities need to be designed and operated more efficiently, which requires a better understanding of the relationship between climate change and flood events. This study proposed a framework combining the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models to assess the impact of climate change on flood events. HEC-HMS is one of the most commonly used hydrologic models in the USA, and CMIP5 provides the latest climate data for potential future climate scenarios. The proposed approach is applied to the Nippersink Creek watershed, which shows that 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year precipitations for the low, medium, and high emission scenarios are all greater than the historic observations. The corresponding 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year floods are remarkably higher than in the historic observations for the three climate scenarios. The high emission scenario results in dramatically increased flood risks in the future. The case study demonstrates that the framework combining HEC-HMS and CMIP5 is easy to use and efficient for assessing climate change impacts on flood events. It is a valuable tool when complicated and distributed hydrologic modeling is not an option because of time or monetary constraints.

Although reservoir operation is a potential adaptation option, earlier studies explicitly demonstrated only its historical quantitative effects. Therefore, this article evaluated the possibility of reservoir operation from an adaptation viewpoint for regulating the future flow using the H08 global hydrological model with the Chao Phraya River basin as a case study. This basin is the largest river system in Thailand and has often been affected by extreme weather challenges in the past. Future climate scenarios were constructed from the bias-corrected outputs of three general circulation models from 2080 to 2099 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The important conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows: (i) the operation of existing and hypothetical (i.e., construction under planning) reservoirs cannot reduce the future high flows below the channel carrying capacity, although it can increase low flows in the basin. This indicates that changes in the magnitude of future high flow due to climate change are likely to be larger than those achieved by reservoir operation and there is a need for other adaptation options. (ii) A combination of reservoir operation and afforestation was considered as an adaptation strategy, but the magnitude of the discharge reduction in the wet season was still smaller than the increase caused by warming. This further signifies the necessity of combining other structural, as well as non-structural, measures. Overall, this adaptation approach for assessing the effect of reservoir operation in reducing the climate change impacts using H08 model can be applied not only in the study area but also in other places where climate change signals are robust.

Up to this point, most attribution studies have focused on univariate drivers, despite the fact that many impacts are related to multiple compounding weather and climate drivers. For instance, co-occurring climate extremes in neighbouring regions can lead to very large combined impacts. Yet, attribution of spatially compounding events with different hazards poses a great challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for compound event attribution to disentangle the effects of natural variability and anthropogenic climate change on the event. Taking the 2020 spatially compounding heavy precipitation and heatwave event in China as a showcase, we find that the respective dynamic and thermodynamic contributions to the intensity of this event are 51% (35-67%) and 39% (18-59%), and anthropogenic climate change has increased the occurrence probability of similar events at least 10-fold. We estimate that compared to the current climate, such events will become 10 times and 14 times more likely until the middle and end of the 21st century, respectively, under a high-emissions scenario. This increase in likelihood can be substantially reduced (to seven times more likely) under a low-emissions scenario. Our study demonstrates the effect of anthropogenic climate change on high-impact compound extreme events and highlights the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate-driven migration: prioritizing cultural resources threatened by secondary impacts of climate change	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Archaeology; Climate-driven resettlement; Cultural resource management; Sea-level rise; Climate change; Migration	SEA-LEVEL RISE; HERITAGE	Archaeological sites are increasingly threatened by primary impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, flooding, and erosion. These important sites represent cultural heritage and contain unique past environmental, ecological, and climate information. Stewardship of these cultural resources is generally limited to mitigation and salvage of immediately threatened sites, with little forethought given to secondary impacts of climate change. Secondary impacts are defined in this paper as climate-driven resettlement and associated development and may result in destruction of archaeological sites via resettlement of affected populations. The United Nations predicts increases above existing rates of resettlement of climate-affected communities from areas in which in situ infrastructure adaptations are not economically feasible, legal, or physically possible. Resulting development will likely disturb archaeological sites in interior regions. These cultural, environmental, and climate archives may be lost if urgent, unplanned climate-driven resettlement overwhelms state and local protections. Thus, planning for climate-driven resettlement should include standard methods for assessing threats to archaeological sites. Using Southern Maine as a pilot study, we report a trial methodology for identifying towns likely to experience rapid increases in population and infrastructure development related to climate-driven resettlement. Socioeconomic and demographic data, land cover change analyses, and archaeological records are combined in this risk assessment framework. The products are town-level maps that identify archaeological sites threatened by secondary impacts of climate change (climate-driven migration). This tool enables prioritization of threatened sites prior to potential destruction by large-scale migration and associated economic development and makes timely development compliance with federal and state legislation more likely.

Climate change may alter key attributes of these events and consequently health and distribution of aquatic species. Improved knowledge of biological responses to different types of floods and droughts in rivers should allow the better prediction of the ecological consequences of climate change-induced flow alterations. This review highlights that in unmodified ecosystems, the intensity and direction of biological impacts of floods and droughts vary, but the overall consequence is an increase in biological diversity and ecosystem health. To predict the impact of climate change, metrics that allow the quantitative linking of physical disturbance attributes to the directions and intensities of biological impacts are needed. The link between habitat change and the character of biological response is provided by the frequency of occurrence of the river wave characteristic-that is the event's predictability. The severity of impacts of floods is largely related to the river wave amplitude (flood magnitude), while the impact of droughts is related to river wavelength (drought duration).

The Blaney-Criddle (B-C) equation, Budyko framework, and water balance method were coupled for MD calculations. The outputs of 10 global climate models (GCMs) are synthesized to confirm the future changes in air temperature and precipitation under 3 selected Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The climate elasticity (CE) method was used to determine the variation in MD, and the influence of climate factors on that was quantitatively analyzed. The results reveal that the coupling framework of the three methods is suitable for MD determination in the UTRB. The weight-based synthesis of the 10 GCM outputs shows overall increases in temperature (T) and precipitation (P) under the 3 scenarios during most of the time until 2099. The above climate change leads to an increase in MD. According to CE analysis, the positive effectiveness of precipitation is greater than the negative effectiveness of temperature on MD variation, and the increase in precipitation would induce more MD in the UTRB. Uncertainty analysis reveals that GCM outputs dominate in predicting precipitation, while the RCP scenarios influence temperature more. Overall, under the background of climate change, the risk of extreme floods during wet years might increase, and a water deficit will still occur during normal and dry years. The study provides a case example for better understanding MD responses to climate change in the upper reaches of inland river basins. Findings are helpful for reasonable water resource development and utilization in the middle and lower reaches of these basins in the future. As in the Taolai River Basin, considering the future water demand across the whole basin, the development of water-saving technologies and reasonable industrial structures is crucial for a sustainable future.

J	Fierke, KM; Mackay, N				Fierke, K. M.; Mackay, Nicola			The Safety Paradox: Unknown Knowns, Ungrieved Grief, and Collective Agreements not to Know	INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						colonialism and climate change; grief; security dilemma; transgenerational entanglements; traumatic memory	ONTOLOGICAL SECURITY; EMOTIONS; POLITICS; TRAUMA; RACE	The discussion between the developing and developed world in Egypt during COP27 brought the history of colonialism and its impact on climate change to the table, as did the earlier floods in Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of unacknowledged grief, shame and guilt, accruing over centuries, on our ability to move forward to a more sustainable future. At stake is not only a question of 'loss and damage' for those who have suffered disproportionately in the past and present, but also the need to acknowledge how past practice has set the stage for inequality and climate change in the global future. In this article we develop concepts of unknown knowns and ungrieved grief, and explore the mechanisms by which populations collectively turn away from uncomfortable or shameful truths. The failure to look at the past has transgenerational consequences, as present distractions contribute to an inability to 'see' the consequences of past and present action for future generations. The final section explores the safety paradox that arises from the fragmented safety of turning to conflict and war, and a holistic safety that requires grieving for the global whole.	[Fierke, K.

The study focuses on a residential area in a low-lying coastal suburb of Dunedin, New Zealand, where the groundwater level is shallow and close to sea level. An unusually heavy rain event in June 2015 resulted in flooding of a significant portion of land in especially low-lying areas. The city council responded by reviewing processes for storm-water management and by imposing minimum-floor-level [MFL] requirements on new construction in the low-lying areas previously identified as at risk of flooding. Applying a 'diff-in-diff-in-diff' strategy in hedonic regression analyses, we find that houses in the MFL zone sell for a discount of about 5 per cent prior to the flood. This discount briefly tripled in the area that flooded, but disappeared within 15 months, indicating either very short memory among homebuyers or no long-run change in perception of hazard.

This type of flood is commonly unpredictable and often appears chaotic because its occurrence depends on multiple, interacting weather, hydrological, ice and morphological parameters. This paper presents the findings of a research project assessing how climate change impacts dynamic river-ice breakup and associated floods along seven rivers of the province of Quebec, Canada. A combination of empirical river-ice breakup models, state-of-the-art hydrological simulations and standardized climate projections was used to estimate the historical (1972-2000) and future (2042-2070) frequencies of dynamic breakup events. Ice jam flood damage reimbursement data were used to predict changes to financial risk associated with dynamic breakup events. Results show that, overall, ice-jam floods will generate more damage in the future, which justifies watershed-based flood adaptation plans that take into account cold regions hydrological processes. The success of the methodology also sets the table for a comparable project that would include more rivers from different regions of Northeastern America.

Aiming to provide an in-depth picture on the effects of these events on the riparian flora and vegetation in the Mediterranean Basin, especially focusing on islands, a bibliographic search was performed in the main international databases, which led to 571 articles published from 2000 to 2021. Most studies have analyzed these phenomena from the climatic point of view identifying three main topics "Rainfall", "Global/Climate change", and "Flood". 81 papers concerned effects of extreme events on Mediterranean woodland formations and cultivated plants. A further analysis focused on European countries and Mediterranean bioregion using "Extreme rainfall events" and "Extreme rainfall and floods" as keywords. A low number of records relating to Mediterranean island regions was found, having Sicily as the study area. Moreover, seven articles had Sardinia as a study area, four of which referred to flora and vegetation. A lack of studies on the effects of extreme rainfall events on riparian flora and vegetation were highlighted. This review constitutes a call for researchers to explore extreme phenomena that have become recurrent in the Mediterranean Basin.

The World Bank's decision tree framework (DTF) for "confronting climate uncertainty" is one incarnation of those paradigms. In order to better represent the state of the art in climate change risk assessment and evaluation techniques, this paper proposes: (1) an update to the DTF, replacing its "climate change stress test" with a multidimensional stress test; and (2) the addition of a Bayesian network framework that represents joint probabilistic behavior of uncertain parameters as sensitivity factors to aid in the weighting of scenarios of concern (the combination of conditions under which a water system fails to meet its performance targets). Using the updated DTF, water system planners and project managers would be better able to understand the relative magnitudes of the varied risks they face, and target investments in adaptation measures to best reduce their vulnerabilities to change. Next steps for the DTF include enhancements in: modeling of extreme event risks; coupling of human-hydrologic systems; integration of surface water and groundwater systems; the generation of tradeoffs between economic, social, and ecological factors; incorporation of water quality considerations; and interactive data visualization.

J	Gao, MY; Wang, ZM; Yang, HB				Gao, Meiyan; Wang, Zongmin; Yang, Haibo			Review of Urban Flood Resilience: Insights from Scientometric and Systematic Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						urban flood; resilience; climate change; bibliometric; cite space	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER-RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; RISK; GREEN; CITY; MULTISCALE; NETWORK; HAZARDS; WEATHER	In recent decades, climate change is exacerbating meteorological disasters around the world, causing more serious urban flood disaster losses. Many solutions in related research have been proposed to enhance urban adaptation to climate change, including urban flooding simulations, risk reduction and urban flood-resistance capacity. In this paper we provide a thorough review of urban flood-resilience using scientometric and systematic analysis. Using Cite Space and VOS viewer, we conducted a scientometric analysis to quantitively analyze related papers from the Web of Science Core Collection from 1999 to 2021 with urban flood resilience as the keyword. We systematically summarize the relationship of urban flood resilience, including co-citation analysis of keywords, authors, research institutions, countries, and research trends. The scientometric results show that four stages can be distinguished to indicate the evolution of different keywords in urban flood management from 1999, and urban flood resilience has become a research hotspot with a significant increase globally since 2015. The research methods and progress of urban flood resilience in these four related fields are systematically analyzed, including climate change, urban planning, urban system adaptation and urban flood-simulation models. Climate change has been of high interest in urban flood-resilience research. Urban planning and the adaptation of urban systems differ in terms of human involvement and local policies, while more dynamic factors need to be jointly described. Models are mostly evaluated with indicators, and comprehensive resilience studies based on traditional models are needed for multi-level and higher performance models. Consequently, more studies about urban flood resilience based on local policies and dynamics within global urban areas combined with fine simulation are needed in the future, improving the concept of resilience as applied to urban flood-risk-management and assessment.

J	Graham, H; Harrison, A; Lampard, P				Graham, Hilary; Harrison, Alexander; Lampard, Pete			Public Perceptions of Climate Change and Its Health Impacts: Taking Account of People's Exposure to Floods and Air Pollution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						climate change; public perceptions; climate-related exposures; flood; air pollution	ATTENTION; MEDIA	Climate change-related exposures such as flooding and ambient air pollution place people's health at risk. A representative UK survey of adults investigated associations between reported flooding and air pollution (in the participants' local area, by the participant personally, and/or by family and close friends) and climate change concerns (CCC) and perceptions of its health impacts (PIH). In regression analyses controlling for socio-demographic factors and health status, exposure was associated with greater CCC and more negative PIH. Compared to those with low CCC, participants who reported local-area exposure were significantly more likely to be fairly (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.26, 3.40) or very concerned (OR 3.40, 95%CI 2.02, 5.71). Odds of greater CCC were higher for those reporting personal and/or family exposure ('fairly concerned': OR 2.83, 95%CI 1.20, 6.66; 'very concerned': OR 4.11, 95%CI 1.69, 10.05) and for those reporting both local and personal/family exposure ('fairly concerned': OR 3.35, 95%CI 1.99, 5.63; 'very concerned': OR 6.17, 95%CI 3.61, 10.55). For PIH, local exposure significantly increased the odds of perceiving impacts as 'more bad than good' (1.86, 95%CI 1.22, 2.82) or 'entirely bad' (OR 1.88; 95%CI 1.13, 3.13). Our study suggests that public awareness of climate-related exposures in their local area, together with personal exposures and those of significant others, are associated with heightened concern about climate change and its health impacts.

A total of 121 smallholder farmers were randomly selected from three vulnerable rural farming communities in northern Ghana through a mixed methodological approach involving household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analysed using descriptive and binary logistic regression with the help of IBM SPSS statistical software package integrated with qualitative thematic analysis involving transcription, categorization and interconnecting. The results show that majority (95.9%) of the smallholders have observed climatic changes in their local ecology with manifestations involving protracted drought (95.9%), unpredictable rainfall pattern (94.2%), high temperature (99.2%), strong winds (66.9%) and frequent flood events (99.2%). As a consequence, smallholders have observed that changes in temperature (99.2%) and rainfall patterns (97.5%) result in decreased agricultural output. In resolving the impacts, these smallholders employ preferred livelihood adaptive strategies involving non-farm diversification (51.2%), crop diversification (75.2%), changes in farm location (76.9%) and agrochemical application (100%) with moderate or high levels of effectiveness across space. The logistic regression results revealed that factors such as age, gender and access to credit significantly influenced smallholder farmers' observation and adaptation to climate change and variability. The findings suggest the need for a location-specific climate adaptation policy. By this, the local knowledge, adaptive capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers could be built upon to mitigate their vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty.

Yet climate change also creates new forms of insecurity through distress migration, immobility and vulnerability that are prevalent in urban destination locations. Here we examine the extent and nature of human security in migration destinations and test whether insecurity is affected by length of residence and environmental hazards. The study develops an index measure of human security at the individual level to include environmental and climate-related hazards as well as sources of well-being, fear of crime and violence, and mental health outcomes. It examines the elements of human security that explain the prevalence of insecurity among recent and established migrants in low-income urban neighbourhoods. The study reports on data collected in Chattogram in Bangladesh through a survey of migrants (N = 447) and from qualitative data derived using photo elicitation techniques with cohorts of city planners and migrants. The results show that environmental hazards represent an increasing source of perceived insecurity to migrant populations over time, with longer-term migrants perceiving greater insecurity than more recent arrivals, suggesting lack of upward social mobility in low-income slums. Ill-health, fear of eviction, and harassment and violence are key elements of how insecurity is experienced, and these are exacerbated by environmental hazards such as flooding. The study expands the concept of security to encompass central elements of personal risk and well-being and outlines the implications for climate change.	[Adger, W.

This paper outlines possible implementation methodologies, procedures and guidance for water storage in natural and artificial reservoirs for better operation and management rules taking into account the impacts of climate change. The literature is full of methodological applications regarding the impact of climate change on the hydro-meteorological records, but the same is not available in reservoirs (surface and underground), which is the scope of this paper. In addition, reservoir structures offer the necessary mitigation and adaptation activities against the effects of climate change to design, construct, maintain, operate or increase their existing capacity. To increase groundwater reservoir capacity in local aquifers, precipitation, associated flooding and flash flooding should be diverted to artificial groundwater recharges through precipitation and surface runoff harvesting activities. Definitions of fully or partially penetrating underground dams are also explained. The real groundwater feeding application is offered from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as arid region representative. Finally, a series of recommendations are presented for the future design and management of reservoirs.

The latter effect is one of the main drivers of rising flood risk has received less attention in comparison to climate change. Economic development and population growth are major causes of urban expansion in flood-prone areas, and a comprehensive understanding of the impact of urban growth on flood risk is an essential ingredient of effective flood risk management. At the same time, planning for community resilience has become a national and worldwide imperative in recent years. Enhancements to community resilience require well-integrated and enormous long-term public and private investments. Accordingly, comprehensive urban growth plans should take rising flood risk into account to ensure future resilient communities through careful collaboration between engineers, geologists, socialists, economists, and urban planners within the framework of life-cycle analysis. This paper highlights the importance of including urban growth in accurate future flood risk assessment and how planning for future urbanization should include measurement science-based strategies in developing policies to achieve more resilient communities.

This review examines mental health impacts of three types of climate-related events: (1) acute events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires; (2) subacute or long-term changes such as drought and heat stress; and (3) the existential threat of long-lasting changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels and a permanently altered and potentially uninhabitable physical environment. The impacts represent both direct (i.e. heat stress) and indirect (i.e. economic loss, threats to health and well-being, displacement and forced migration, collective violence and civil conflict, and alienation from a degraded environment) consequences of global climate change.

Practices to reduce the impacts on the health and well-being of populations must evolve from a reactive mode to preventive, proactive and concerted actions beginning at individual and community levels. Experiences and lessons learned from the pandemic will help to better prevent and reduce the psychosocial impacts of floods, or other hydroclimatic risks, in a climate change context.Design/methodology/approachThe present paper first describes the complexity and the challenges associated with climate change and systemic risks. It also presents some systemic frameworks of mental health determinants, and provides an overview of the different types of psychosocial impacts of disasters. Through various Quebec case studies and using lessons learned from past and recent flood-related events, recommendations are made on how to better integrate individual and community factors in disaster response.FindingsResults highlight the fact that people who have been affected by the events are significantly more likely to have mental health problems than those not exposed to flooding. They further demonstrate the adverse and long-term effects of floods on psychological health, notably stemming from indirect stressors at the community and institutional levels. Different strategies are proposed from individual-centered to systemic approaches, in putting forward the advantages from intersectoral and multirisk researches and interventions.Originality/valueThe establishment of an intersectoral flood network, namely the InterSectoral Flood Network of Quebec (RIISQ), is presented as an interesting avenue to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and a systemic view of flood risks. Intersectoral work is proving to be a major issue in the management of systemic risks, and should concern communities, health and mental health professionals, and the various levels of governance. As climate change is called upon to lead to more and more systemic risks, close collaboration between all the areas concerned with the management of the factors of vulnerability and exposure of populations will be necessary to respond effectively to damages and impacts (direct and indirect) linked to new meteorological and compound hazards. This means as well to better integrate the communication managers into the risk management team.

Despite these challenges, Australia's response to the climate crisis has been inadequate and subject to change by politics, public sentiment, and global developments. This study illustrates the spatiotemporal patterns of selected climate-related environmental extremes (heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and droughts) across Australia during the past two decades, and summarizes climate adaptation measures and actions that have been taken by the national, state/territory, and local governments. Our findings reveal significant impacts of climate-related environmental extremes on the health and well-being of Australians. While governments have implemented various adaptation strategies, these plans must be further developed to yield concrete actions. Moreover, Indigenous Australians should not be left out in these adaptation efforts. A collaborative, comprehensive approach involving all levels of government is urgently needed to prevent, mitigate, and adapt to the health impacts of climate change.

The rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events in China, such as record-high temperatures, low rainfall, severe droughts, and floods in many regions (along with the compound and ripple effects of these events on human health) have underlined the urgent need for health-centred climate action. The rebound in the country's coal consumption observed in 2022 reflected the great challenge faced by China in terms of its coal phase-down, over-riding the country's gains in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Timely and adequate responses will not only reduce or avoid the impacts of climate-related health hazards but can also protect essential infrastructures from disruptions caused by extreme weather. Health and climate change are inextricably linked, necessitating a high prioritisation of health in adaptation and mitigation efforts. The 2023 China report of the Lancet Countdown continues to track progress on health and climate change in China, while now also attributing the health risks of climate change to human activities and providing examples of feasible and effective climate solutions. This fourth iteration of the China report was spearheaded by the Lancet Countdown regional centre in Asia, based at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Progress is monitored across 28 indicators in five domains: from climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability (section 1); to the different elements of action, including adaption (section 2) and mitigation, and their health implications (section 3); to economics and finance (section 4); and public and political engagement (section 5). This report was compiled with the contribution of 76 experts from 26 institutions both within and outside of China. The impending global stocktake at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28), the UN initiative on early warning systems (which pledged to ensure the world was protected by the end of 2027), and China's action plans to reduce air pollutants and GHGs illustrate that global climate action has moved from talk to concrete plans. These initiatives could deliver major health benefits, but none of them explicitly list health as a policy target or indicator. The results of the global stocktake could guide health-focused and feasible interventions. The first Health Day and climate-health ministerial meeting that will be hosted at COP28 underline the trend to mainstream health in the global climate change agenda. Health risks arising from human-induced climate change, and production-based and consumption-based CO2 and ambient particulate matter (PM2 center dot 5) emissions (indicator 4.2.4) indicate the urgent need for mitigation by identifying human contributions to carbon emissions and climate change. Early warning systems for health risks (indicator 2.4) and the city-level human comfort index provide bottom-up examples of adaptation practices.

While ecosystem-based adaptation practices are increasingly recognized and adopted across the world as an important urban development strategy, their effective implementation in diverse biophysical conditions and development contexts is of interest, requiring scientific research and learning. This paper presents the case of China in implementing an ecosystem-based approach - sponge city development - to address the water-related challenges of urbanization and climate change. It draws on the literature to synthesize understanding of the interaction between the urban landscape, urban development, and ecosystem services, and proposes mainstreaming an ecosystem service framework in spatial planning and performance evaluation to guide ecosystem-based adaption practices. Focusing on China's practice, the paper develops a five-step procedure for operationalizing and mainstreaming ecosystem services so as to improve policy implementation for sponge city development. This paper aims to provide a practical perspective to help enhance ecosystem-based adaptation in urban development to better address the challenges of urbanization and climate change.

J	Heinzlef, C; Robert, B; Hémond, Y; Serre, D				Heinzlef, Charlotte; Robert, Benoit; Hemond, Yannick; Serre, Damien			Operating urban resilience strategies to face climate change and associated risks: some advances from theory to application in Canada and France	CITIES			English	Article						Resilience issues; Climate Change; Collaborative workshops; Spatial-decision support systems	FLOODS; MODEL	Faced with increasing urbanization and uncertainties linked to climate change, the scientific community has integrated the concept of resilience into urban management practices. Once revolutionary, now a buzzword, resilience is a concept that is difficult to transform into an integrated tool that stakeholders accept and adopt. This paper offers a perspective on the different interpretations of resilience, its difficult implementation and the tools that seek to operationalize it. The underlying questions are how these tools are appropriated by urban managers and territorial decision-makers, and how the theoretical concept can be translated into resilient urban development. This research paper reviews the work on resilience and investigates its use and operationalization, comparing two different approaches - organizational (Canada) and holistic (France) - that aim to clarify and operationalize resilience. These theoretical approaches have been combined to create workshops for urban managers so they can move from theoretical results to practical applications.

The authors use outputs from climate models reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change and published literature on the economic impact of rising temperatures, change in tropical cyclone activity, and coastal flooding caused by sea level rise. The authors improve on existing sovereign pricing models by considering sovereign segmentation into developed markets, emerging markets issuing bonds in local currency, and emerging markets issuing bonds in a hard currency. By passing climate change's economic impacts through the pricing model, the authors can assess the relative pricing impact for each security. The authors also provide country-level climate risk scores and change in risk-neutral probability of default for each issuer. This is novel research and is likely to be improved over time as more practitioners start considering climate risks as financial risks.

Enhancing the resilience of high-vulnerability, low-elevation coastal zones	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation; Outer Hebrides; Uist; Machair; Flooding; Biodiversity; Connectivity; Meta-ecosystems	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH UIST; WAVE HEIGHT; ADAPTATION; ATLANTIC; SCOTLAND; EXAMPLE; TIDE	This paper aims to explore how resilience to climate change can be achieved and optimised within an example of a complex, high-vulnerability and low-elevation coastal zone. In Uist, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, a completed INTERREG project provided a framework for resilience planning in a complex, multifaceted environment, where official bodies, NGOs, academics and the community already work together productively. A range of approaches to coping with climate change in Uist is reviewed, some of these originating from within the community, and the local situation is discussed in the context of the extent to which resilience theory and national policy intertwine. These approaches identify and combine nature-based solutions and compatible engineering-based solutions, demonstrating how resilience can be achieved and enhanced in a vulnerable area via sustained engagement with local communities backed by peer-reviewed research and complying with the policy context.

Since the dawn of the millennium, LID-centric research has demonstrated a persistent upward trajectory, mainly focusing on its capacity to mitigate climate change repercussions, particularly runoff and peak flows. However, a standardized rubric and toolkit for LID evaluation remain elusive. While numerous studies have documented the hydrological and water quality benefits of LID, the impacts of climate change on its effectiveness remain uncertain due to varying spatial and temporal climate patterns. This comprehensive review examined 1355 peer-reviewed articles in English, comprising both research articles and reviews, indexed in the Web of Science up until 2022. Findings from the bibliometric analysis revealed significant contributions and emergent trends in the field. Notably, there is an increasing emphasis on performance evaluation and efficiency of LID systems, and on understanding their impact on hydrology and water quality. However, this review identified the lack of a standardized LID evaluation framework and the uncertainty in LID effectiveness due to varying climate patterns. Furthermore, this study highlighted the urgent need for optimization of current hydrological models, advancement of LID optimization, modeling, monitoring, and performance, and stakeholder awareness about LID functionality. This review also underscored the potential future research trajectories, including the need to quantify LID's effectiveness in urban flooding and water quality management and refining LID simulation models. Cumulatively, this review consolidates contemporaneous and prospective research breakthroughs in urban LID, serving as an indispensable compendium for academics and practitioners in the discipline.

A call for the library community to deploy best practices toward a database for biocultural knowledge relating to climate change	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Libraries; Open access; Local knowledge; Stewardship; Climate change; Best practices; Repository; Database management systems; Traditional knowledge; Biocultural heritage	HERITAGE	Purpose In this paper, a call to the library and information science community to support documentation and conservation of cultural and biocultural heritage has been presented Design/methodology/approach Based in existing Literature, this proposal is generative and descriptive-rather than prescriptive-regarding precisely how libraries should collaborate to employ technical and ethical best practices to provide access to vital data, research and cultural narratives relating to climate. Findings COVID-19 and climate destruction signal urgent global challenges. Library best practices are positioned to respond to climate change. Literature indicates how libraries preserve, share and cross-link cultural and scientific knowledge. With wildfires, drought, flooding and other extreme or slow-onset weather events presenting dangers, it is imperative that libraries take joint action toward facilitating sustainable and open access to relevant information. Practical implications An initiative could create an easily-accessible, open, linked, curated, secure and stakeholder-respectful database for global biocultural heritage-documenting traditional knowledge, local knowledge and climate adaptation traditions. Social implications Ongoing stakeholder involvement from the outset should acknowledge preferences regarding whether or how much to share information. Ethical elements must be embedded from concept to granular access and metadata elements. Originality/value Rooted in the best practices and service orientation of library science, the proposal envisions a sustained response to a common global challenge. Stewardship would also broadly assist the global community by preserving and providing streamlined access to information of instrumental value to addressing climate change.

This study aims to develop region-specific storm risk matrices for the 25 districts in Seoul and predict storm risks. By accounting for local meteorological and geographic characteristics, these matrices will enable a more targeted approach to issuing heavy rainfall warnings, as opposed to the current nationwide system. The methodology involves calculating entropy weight based on various factors, assessing flood vulnerability, and estimating region-specific rainfall associated with warning levels. These warning levels are then used to create storm risk matrices, which are tested for conformity against historical flood events. Finally, a storm risk prediction technique is developed using rainfall forecasting data. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using the newly developed storm risk matrices to predict flood damage up to 72 h in advance. This greatly contributes to the development of effective mitigation plans for addressing climate change-driven urban flood damage. The study's findings offer valuable insights for enhancing local-specific heavy rainfall warning systems and ensuring better preparation in the face of increasing urban flood risks due to climate change.

In light of these irreversible trends, the process of adaptation of the rural territory is a necessary step, in order to increase its climate resilience. In this study, the vulnerability assessment was the tool used to evaluate the specific phenomenon of "flooding and backwatering" in the case study of Emilia Romagna region (Italy). The approach was based on the IPCC's risk analysis methodology, populated by different layers regarding specifical proxies related to the adaptive capacity and the sensitivity of the territory to water stagnation, then we assessed with the normalization process of the different information levels. The aim of the research consisted in the realization of a regional map of the vulnerability to floods and backwaters, in order to rank the territory to this specific phenomenon. The final result could be useful both for the relationship with planning choices and for local-based actions in agricultural policies that in Italy are taken at regional level.

In this sense, this work aimed to study the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on fish assemblages in the Rio Minho estuary (Portugal). Between 2010 and 2019, continuous weekly sampling with fyke nets was carried out to assess the dynamics of fish assemblages in the estuary. In addition, temperature and precipitation data were obtained from satellite information to assess the relationship between climatic variables and fish composition, structure, and diversity. Fish populations changed significantly over time, becoming less diverse and largely dominated by a few, mostly invasive species (e.g., carp, goldfish, pumpkinseed, and tench), while the abundance of most native species declined over the years (e.g., panjorca, stickleback, and shad). High temperatures and low precipitation negatively affected native species, while the invasive species benefited from increased temperatures and extreme weather events (droughts and floods).

A number of 22 pollen records, complemented by Alnus macrofossil data, document the presence of widespread alder populations in the coastal Tyrrhenian floodplains throughout the Holocene, although with different density from one site to the other, mostly depending on local hydrological conditions. The role of climate changes in the dynamics of floodplain forests appears uncertain. In the last two centuries, major reclamation works disrupted this natural vegetation to obtain fertile plains that are now exploited for agricultural purposes, industrial activities, urban areas and related infrastructures. Only a few remnants of the original alder forests are preserved by international conservation conventions, as biodiversity reservoirs of severely endangered habitats. However, the vanished alder forests, which proved to be able to rapidly recover several times through the Holocene, may still have some potential to be restored.

The capacity of global ecosystems to provide services such as sequestering carbon and regulating hydrology is being strongly reduced both by climate change itself and by unprecedented rates of ecosystem degradation. These services rely on functional aspects of ecosystems that are causally linked-the same ecosystem components that efficiently sequester and store carbon also regulate hydrology by sequestering and storing water. This means that climate change adaptation and mitigation must involve not only preparing for a future with temperature and precipitation anomalies, but also actively minimizing climate hazards and risks by conserving and managing ecosystems and their fundamental supporting and regulating ecosystem services. We summarize general climate-nature feedback processes relating to carbon and water cycling on a broad global scale before focusing on Norway to exemplify the crucial role of ecosystem regulatory services for both carbon sequestration and hydrological processes and the common neglect of this ecosystem-climate link in policy and landscape management. We argue that a key instrument for both climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is to take advantage of the climate buffering and regulative abilities of a well-functioning natural ecosystem. This will enable shared benefits to nature, climate, and human well-being. To meet the global climate and nature crises, we must capitalize on the importance of nature for buffering climate change effects, combat short-term perspectives and the discounting of future costs, and maintain or even strengthen whole-ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Significance StatementNatural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and heaths are key for the cycling and storage of water and carbon. Preserving these systems is essential for climate mitigation and adaptation and will also secure biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Systematic failure to recognize the links between nature and human well-being underlies the current trend of accelerating loss of nature and thereby nature's ability to buffer climate changes and their impacts. Society needs a new perspective on spatial planning that values nature as a sink and store of carbon and a regulator of hydrological processes, as well as for its biodiversity. We need policies that fully encompass the role of nature in preventing climate-induced disasters, along with many other benefits for human well-being.

Intermediate egrets (Ardea intermedia) are highly dependent on rice field habitats. Here, we examine the effect of a shift from rice monoculture to rice-barley double cultivation on the use of rice fields by intermediate egrets in South Korea. Rice-barley double cultivation has been increasing steadily in the southern region of South Korea due to changes in the rice growth period under climate change and maximization of economic benefits.We studied rice fields to determine the effect of the rice-barley double cultivation area on the abundance of intermediate egrets on the regional scale and their potential distribution pattern in response to double cultivation in relation to climate change using national-scale climate, altitude and land cover data from 1 May to 23 June 2018.Compared to the irrigation practices used for rice monoculture, irrigation was stopped for some time in rice-barley double cultivation prior to planting, compromising the role of rice fields as a food ground for intermediate egrets. The potential abundance of intermediate egrets rapidly decreased by half when the double cultivation area increased to >40% of the total rice-field area, and was less than one individual if the area increased to >80%. Furthermore, according to climate change projections, by 2100, the double cultivation area would account for 75.74% of the predicted range of intermediate egret foraging ground. Synthesis and applications. Double cultivation areas should be <40% of existing rice fields to minimize the impact of the change in cultivation practices. This approach can also convert rice fields to other types of land use. Consequently, appropriate conservation and management measures may be developed to maintain suitable habitats despite rapidly changing cultivation practices resulting from climate change.

Landscape evolution of the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area in response to future climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Mass movement; Rainfall; CAESAR-Lisflood; Earthquake; Climate change	CELLULAR-MODEL; SOIL-EROSION; RIVER-BASIN; LANDSLIDES; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS; SENSITIVITY; SCENARIOS	The Wenchuan earthquake caused rapid and gradual changes to the local geomorphology in the earthquake-stricken area. Extreme rainfall events can have strong impacts on local geomorphic evolution and alter the risks of subsequent geohazards and flooding. However, there is still lack of understanding of long-term geomorphic and fluvial evolution in face of changing future climate. In this paper, we first perform the future extreme rainfall projection and then analyze the landscape evolution variation under future climate change with the CAESAR-Lisflood model. A new approach to applying the 'NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP)' dataset at the local scale is presented, and a future landscape evolution analysis is conducted. We used spatial (tailoring process) and statistical temporal downscaling methods with NEX-GDDP data to project future extreme rainfall in combination with the CAESAR-Lisflood model to simulate the landscape evolution in response to climate change. The results showed that the future rainfall projection model can provide the most robust and effective representative of future climate change scenarios at the local scale, the geological and geomorphological environment of the basin continues to change dynamically after the earthquake, and nearly 27 years (similar to 2035) are needed before the geomorphology of the basin stabilizes, and then, the yearly yield remains at an average rate of 1 x 10(4) m(3). Post-earthquake mountainous area response and recovery characteristics to a changing future climate can provide important information on future geohazard projections and measures to be taken.

Climate Variability, Change and the Impacts on Livelihood Vulnerability of Farming Households in Koronadal, South Cotabato, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; climate variability; livelihood vulnerability	COMMUNITY	This study examined the changes and variability in temperature and rainfall patterns in the past 31 years (1981-2012) and assessed their impacts on livelihood vulnerability offarming households in the City of Koronadal, South Cotabato, a less studied area in Mindanao located in Southern Philippines. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework, household vulnerability was assessed using survey data from 265 respondents, complemented with focus group discussion, and field observations from 2013 to 2015. Results " showed significant changes in monthly mean minimum (increased by 0.74 C, p <0.01) and mean maximum (decreased by 0.65C, p <0.01) temperature. Rainfall patterns showed a decreasing trend and revealed significant changes in June (p<0.01), August, and December (p<0.05), signifring that climate change and variability took place as manifested by floods, landslides, and drought experienced by farming households. The study confirmed that majority of the farming households had "moderate to high vulnerability" to climate variability and change. As climate change brings new.forms of risks, appropriate adaptation strategies are needed to address both current andfuture vulnerability and require robust vulnerability assessment founded on recent scientific advancement and innovative strategies congruent to this study.

This article considers decisions over assets as a neurobiological process in which an associative memory with pattern completion informs choices. We develop these neuroeconomic explanations and analyze their implications for climate change-related shocks in asset markets, and discuss these effects in the context of both individual experiences as well as community-driven remembering. These neuroeconomic models provide mechanistic explanations for behavioral responses to more easily accessed information (the "representativeness " and "availability " heuristics, "framing " and "priming "). Understanding the links from neuroscience to economics is critical to building policies and institutions capable of coping with and adjusting to disasters affecting real assets that are increasing in frequency and scope due to climate change.

New challenges for intensive care medicine due to climate change and global warming	ANAESTHESIST			German	Article						Lung diseases; Cardiovascular diseases; Kidney diseases; Infectious diseases; Mental health	HEAT-WAVE; TEMPERATURE; HEALTH; CKD	Background In the last five decades a continuous increase in the average global temperature has been recorded. Furthermore, natural disasters (e.g. heat waves, severe storms, floods and large forest fires) are becoming more frequent. The impact of global warming and climate change on health involves an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and cognitive mental diseases. Furthermore, a change in the frequency and patterns of infectious diseases can also be observed in Europe. Material and methods This article presents the most important studies that investigated diseases associated with the climate change, with special reference to those that represent a challenge for intensive care medicine. Results Currently available epidemiological data and statistical extrapolations indicate that diseases resulting from the climate change (acute infection-related respiratory and intestinal diseases, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions, heat-related dehydration, cerebral insults and myocardial infarction) are relevant for intensive care medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on a significant increase in acute kidney damage during heat waves. A previously unknown pattern of infectious diseases necessitates new knowledge and targeted management. In some studies, persisting mental impairments were registered during heat waves and natural disasters, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. Conclusion Intensive care medicine must be prepared for the challenges due to global warming and climate change. Slow but continuous changes (e.g. rise in temperature) as well as acute changes (e.g. heat waves and natural disasters) will induce an increased need for intensive medical care services (e.g. an increase in the need for renal replacement procedures). Intensive care physicians will need to be familiar with the diagnostics and management of diseases associated with the climate change. An initiative of the specialist societies involved would be welcomed.

J	Faggian, P				Faggian, Paola			Future Precipitation Scenarios over Italy	WATER			English	Article						Euro-CORDEX models; climate extremes; future projections	CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; CORDEX; PERFORMANCE	To support the development of national adaptation policies and measures addressing climate change impacts over Italy, this work aims to analyze projected changes in mean temperatures and precipitations, and extreme events such as droughts and floods, highlighting some local trends in the different Italian regions that have been little considered to date. The investigations are made on the basis of a set of high-resolution Euro-CORDEX models (horizontal resolution 0.11 degrees, about 12 km) to infer quantitative assessments about the danger of climate changes under three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): business as usual scenario, i.e., without a reduction in green-house gas emissions (RCP 8.5), medium stabilization scenario (RCP 4.5) and mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6). After filtering the models with limited performances in reconstructing the current climate, the multi-model climate change scenarios were characterized by comparing the ensemble mean values computed for the base-line period (1971-2000) with those elaborated for the short- (2021-2050), medium- (2041-2070) and long-term (2071-2100). Two WMO ETCCDI indices were considered to investigate climate extremes: Consecutive Dry Days and extreme precipitations. Despite some uncertainties (related to discrepancies among the models), drought conditions and extreme precipitations will likely exacerbate in the coming decades without mitigation (RCP 8.5). Such conditions will be less critical if partial mitigation actions will be undertaken (RCP 4.5) and are expected to be significantly reduced with decarbonization policies (RCP 2.6).

Rainstorms are extreme weather events that can severely impact people's lives, property, and socioeconomic development. Vulnerability as it relates to climate change has been widely discussed. The Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposed an Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptive capacity (ESA) framework for vulnerability assessment. Flood disaster vulnerability based on the ESA framework has been studied, while few studies have focused on rainstorm disaster vulnerability. In this study, Liaoning Province of China is selected as the study area. A rainstorm disaster vulnerability index system is created based on the ESA framework, and precipitation and economic and social development are used. Random Forests is used to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics and feature importance. The results show that grade variation is decreasing, but grades are still high. Grade variation shows an "increase-decrease-increase" pattern from West to East. Grades are closely related to hazard sensitive population, economic development levels, people's income, and agriculture infrastructure levels, economic and social development indicators are the key to disaster prevention and mitigation. Our study not only contributes to enriching the research on rainstorm disaster vulnerability, but also offers new ideas for the improvement of disaster prevention, mitigation capacities, and policy formulation.

Statistical Down Scaling Model (SDSM) and Geographical Information System (GIS) are used for climate change scenario and spatial analyses. Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydraulic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model is used for rainfall-runoff simulation. The investigated results show significant changes in climatological parameters, i.e., an increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation over the last 40 years, and a significant urban expansion is also observed from 2000 to 2020. The increase in temperature and urbanization has reduced the infiltration rate into the soil and increased the runoff flows. The HEC-HMS results indicate that surface runoff gradually increased over the last two decades. Consequently, the depth of the water table in the shallow aquifer has declined by about 0.3 m/year. Projected climate indices stipulate that groundwater depletion will occur in the future. Arsenic levels have exceeded the permissible limit owing to unplanned urban expansion and open dumping of industrial effluents. The results can help an efficient water resources management in Multan.

Portraying the human impacts of EWEs is part of a health frame that suggests public knowledge of these risks will spur support for needed policy change. The health frame has gained traction since the Paris COP21 (United Nations Climate Change Conference) and arguably helped to achieve modest progress at the Glasgow COP26. However, reporting rarely covers the full picture of health impacts from EWEs, instead focusing on cost of damages, mortality, and displacement. This review summarizes data for 30 major EWEs of 2021 and, based on the epidemiological literature, discusses morbidity-related exposures for four hazards that marked the year: wildfire smoke; extreme cold and power outages; extreme, precipitation-related flooding; and drought. A very large likely burden of morbidity was found, with particularly widespread exposure to risk of respiratory outcomes (including interactions with COVID-19) and mental illnesses. There is need for a well-disseminated global annual report on EWE morbidity, including affected population estimates and evolving science. In this way, the public health frame may be harnessed to bolster evidence for the broader and promising frame of "urgency and agency" for climate change action.

A primary household survey has been conducted to collect data on socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategy, health, food, water, social network, natural disaster and climate variation indicators, were selected for Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) analyses to measure and compare the vulnerability of mouzas (administrative unit) currently suffering from frequent flooding, coastal erosion and embankment breaching on an annual basis. Secondary data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Water Resources Information System of India and the Global Sea Level Observing System have been used to identify dynamics of climate change by employing statistical and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A GPS survey has been conducted to identify locations of embankment breaching, and satellite images obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and U.S. Geological Survey (NASA USGS) Government website have been applied to shoreline and land use change detection, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification. The results indicate that the study area has experienced increasing temperature, changing precipitation patterns, rise in sea level, higher storm surges, shoreline change, constant land loss, embankment breaching and changing land use, which have had impact on vulnerability, particularly of poorer people. The LVI (0.48 to 0.68) and LVI-IPCC (0.04 to 0.14) scores suggest that the populations of Dhablat, Bankimnagar, Sumatinagar, Muri Ganga and Sibpur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI scores of 0.60 to 0.68 and LVI-IPCC scores of 0.11 to 0.14) to climate change both because the communities are more exposed to it, and because poor access to food, health facilities and water makes them extremely sensitive to it and lowers their adaptive capacity. The findings of this study could be crucial to framing further development and adaptation strategies relating to climate change, and to safeguarding the estuarine ecosystem and the vulnerable population.

Rising incidence and risks of floods in urban Ghana: Is climate change to blame?	CITIES			English	Article						Flood incidence; Climate change; Rainfall variability; Anthropogenic factors; Urban Ghana	COVER CHANGE; SOLID-WASTE; LAND-USE; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; KUMASI; CATCHMENT; MUMBAI; POOR; CITY	The current policy and stakeholder debates suggest that climate change remains a risk factor for the rising urban floods situation in Ghana. However, there is a dearth of empirical works to explain the link between flood incidence and climatic-related factors. Using a long-term secondary climatic data, this paper analyses the extent to which climate change influences the incidence of floods in urban Ghana. In-depth qualitative analysis of the perspectives of households and key informants was carried out to complement the initial quantitative analysis in order to broaden the understanding of the risk factors of the worsening floods situation. The results have shown that the rising flood situation in Kumasi is largely independent of climate-induced increase in rainfall and current temperature patterns but strongly linked with anthropogenic factors, including unregulated urban expansion, inadequate drainage infrastructure, poor solid waste management practices, and weak institutional and regulatory regimes. Strengthening institutions, law enforcement and public education are important interventions to control the flood menace in Ghana.

In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), it has led to significant social consequences, especially those caused by flooding, which is very common in the region. One way of protecting settlements from catastrophic floods is to relocate them to non-flooded terraces. In the article, the author examined the local adaptation to consequences of flooding after relocation the cases two villages, Kyllakh and Khatystyr. Field studies of adaptations to the relocation showed social down sides, including the risks of broken family ties, as well as artificially created gender tension. Currently, residents of the two villages are divided into two groups. Families with children live in the new village sites (mostly women with preschool and schoolchildren), while the older population stay in the old village sites. The article analyses the causes and consequences of this gender situation.

However, determining the impacts of these precipitation changes on floods is non-trivial as floods are a result of many compounding factors. For example, changes in the timing and spatial distribution of rainfalls influence soil moisture conditions prior to the flood-causing precipitation event, which in turn change the peak and volume of the resultant flood. Despite this, the impact of climate-changed precipitation on runoff and flood volumes has yet to be quantified historically or examined under different scenarios of climate change.It has previously been suggested that in Australia, the impact of increased precipitation on floods have been partially offset by decreases in soil moisture prior to storms. Here, we seek to quantify the change in flood-event runoff coefficients resulting from climate change across Australia, where it is hoped that such information can be used to help inform the projections of floods resulting from climate-change-induced precipitation changes. We use an event runoff coefficient to assess the flood runoff response to precipitation events containing the annual maximum three-day rainfall event. The assessment was applied to 467 unimpaired catchments in Australia ranging across arid, temperate, and tropical climates. Catchments in temperate climates largely show decreasing trends in event runoff coefficients while increasing trends were observed in tropical regions. Statistically sig-nificant trend magnitudes of up to 0.13 per decade were found.Runoff outputs from a semi-distributed landscape model were then used to assess projected runoff responses under different scenarios of future climates. The outputs of modelled runoff were first validated and shown to adequately capture the observed spatial and temporal trends in flood event runoff coefficients despite under-estimating the trend magnitude. The projections showed that the median proportion of rainfall converted to runoff from large rainfall events will decrease into the future across over 80% of unimpaired catchments in Australia under climate change scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Future work will investigate how these re-ductions in flood volume are best represented by rainfall loss models used widely in operational flood forecasts and design applications.

Climate change along with other global change forcings will diminish the opportunities for sustainability of cities, especially in coastal areas in low-income countries. Climate forcings include global temperature and heatwave increases that are expanding the equatorial tropical belt, sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones, both increases and decreases in freshwater inputs to coastal zones, and increasingly severe extreme precipitation events, droughts, freshwater shortages, heat waves, and wildfires. Current climate impacts are already strongly influencing natural and human systems. Because of proximity to several key warming variables such as sea-level rise and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, coastal cities are a leading indicator of what may occur worldwide. Climate change alone will diminish the sustainability and resilience of coastal cities, especially in the tropical-subtropical belt, but combined with other global changes, this suite of forcings represents an existential threat, especially for coastal cities. Urbanization has coincided with orders of magnitude increases in per capita GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn has led to unprecedented demand for natural resources and degradation of natural systems and more expensive infrastructure to sustain the flows of these resources. Most resources to fuel cities are extracted from ex-urban areas far away from their point of final use. The urban transition over the last 200 years is a hallmark of the Anthropocene coinciding with large surges in use of energy, principally fossil fuels, population, consumption and economic growth, and environmental impacts such as natural system degradation and climate change. Fossil energy enabled and underwrote Anthropocene origins and fueled the dramatic expansion of modern urban systems. It will be difficult for renewable energy and other non-fossil energy sources to ramp up fast enough to fuel further urban growth and maintenance and reverse climate change all the while minimizing further environmental degradation. Given these trajectories, the future sustainability of cities and urbanization trends, especially in threatened areas like coastal zones in low-income countries in the tropical to sub-tropical belt, will likely diminish. Adaptation to climate change may be limited and challenging to implement, especially for low-income countries.

The expected impacts over the next few decades may differ from region to region, with some areas becoming humid and others drier. In regions such as the Mediterranean basin, the main expected impacts of climate change will be prolonged droughts and an increase in the intensity and frequency of heavy rains. Measures of mitigation and adaptation are particularly important in urban environments, where more than half of the population lives, and rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) are considered to be a very suitable solution to these problems. However, the published studies have mainly focussed on buildings, with very limited references to the interest of its application in large urban infrastructure. Based on consumption and precipitation data, this article presents a study on the implementation of an RWHS in a large-scale sports infrastructure located in the city of Cascais (Portugal) intended for the practice of tennis, with 12 brick dust fields, some of them covered. The average annual consumption of potable water for watering the tennis courts is 5500 m(3), and the results show that the RWHS can reduce this consumption by >50%, in addition to other expected benefits, such as the known effect of these systems in reducing flood peaks in the area.

To-date, little research has examined connections between incremental and transformative adaptation. We address this gap using two multi-functional flood defence projects in Clontarf, a community in Dublin, Ireland, one of which represents transformative and the other incremental adaptation. Using a repeated study, we ask (i) does the importance of place-related values differ depending on whether adaptation is incremental or transformative, and (ii) what role does trust in governance play in incremental adaptation when transformation fails? Surveys were administered in Clontarf in 2014 (n = 280) after community resistance to transformative flood defences. A follow-up study using an identical survey was undertaken to evaluate separate incremental flood defences in 2016 (n = 242). Results highlight several important findings. First, both adaptation interventions show repeated potential threats to place from perceived weak governance rather than from disruptive place change caused by climate change. Second, where place attachment is strong, communities may repeatedly resist potential threats to place by challenging poor governance. However, this inadvertently threatens place disruption from climate change e.g., extreme climatic events. This could cause maladaptation, tying future decisions to past actions and failing to consider alternative transformative adaptation pathways. Finally, community discussions on transformative pathways and avoiding maladaptation risks are crucial for successful adaptation. This includes recognising trade-offs between place disruption threats from proposed adaptation strategies and climate change. Governance processes may subsequently need to transform and incorporate learnings or risk repeated resistance to adaptation previously considered rational. Many of these issues are likely to be encountered in all regions globally and across multiple adaptation sectors. Findings therefore provide important evidence to improve adaptation outcomes more generally.

To alleviate urban flooding disasters, strategies coupled with green and grey infrastructure have been proposed to support urban stormwater management. However, most strategies rely largely on diachronic rainfall data and ignore long-term climate change impacts. This study described a novel framework to assess and to identify the optimal solution in response to uncertainties following climate change. The assessment framework consists of three components: (1) assess and process climate data to generate long-term time series of meteorological parameters under different climate conditions; (2) optimise the design of Grey-Green infrastructure systems to establish the optimal design solutions; and (3) perform a multi-criteria assessment of economic and hydrological performance to support decision-making. A case study in Guangzhou, China was carried out to demonstrate the usability and application processes of the framework. The results of the case study illustrated that the optimised Grey-Green infrastructure could save life cycle costs and reduce total outflow (56-66%), peak flow (22-85%), and TSS (more than 60%) compared to the fully centralised grey infrastructure system, indicating its high superior in economic competitiveness and hydrological performance under climate uncertainties. In terms of spatial configuration, the contribution of green infrastructure appeared not as critical as the adoption of decentralisation of the drainage networks. Furthermore, under extreme drought scenarios, the decentralised infrastructure system exhibited an exceptionally high degree of removal performance for non-point source pollutants.

However, the geogenic foundational processes underlying the high As aquifers remain elusive. Here we present joint lines of evidences from chronological, sediment geochemical and geo-microbial analysis that climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) initiates the genesis of high As aquifers in the central Yangtze River Basin, which represents Quaternary alluvial-lacustrine floodplains affected by arsenicosis occurrence. Optically stimulated luminescence-based sediments dating and grain size character-ization indicate that the LGM depositional boundary also separates the Late-Pleistocene/Holocene high arsenic aquifers from the underlying arsenic-depleted aquifers. Further examination of solid-phase As/Fe/S speciation and associated microbial communities function suggests that the pre-LGM depositional environments charac-teristic of S metabolism engender the fixation of As in pyrite, whereas during the post-LGM period climate change	[Xu, Yuxiao; Deng, Yamin; Du, Yao; Pi, Kunfu; Xie, Xianjun; Gan, Yiqun; Ma, Teng; Wang, Yanxin] China Univ Geosci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Source Apportionmen, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuxiao; Deng, Yamin; Du, Yao; Pi, Kunfu; Xie, Xianjun; Gan, Yiqun; Ma, Teng; Wang, Yanxin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Tianliang] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Ecol & Environm, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hongchen; Wang, Yanxin] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China	China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; Chengdu University of Technology; China University of Geosciences	Deng, YM; Wang, YX (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Source Apportionmen, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China.; Deng, YM; Wang, YX (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Wang, YX (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.	yamin.deng@cug.edu.cn; yx.wang@cug.edu.cn	xie, xianjun/C-4900-2011; 邓, 娅敏/B-1275-2019; Du, Yao/HDN-4489-2022	Deng, Yamin/0000-0002-4815-7176; Du, Yao/0000-0002-5954-5465	National Natural Science Foundation of China [41977174, 42020104005]; 111 Program (State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs & the Ministry of Education of China) [B18049]; National Key Research and Development Program [2021YFA0715900]; Key Research and Development Program in Hubei Province [2020BCA088]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Program (State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs & the Ministry of Education of China); National Key Research and Development Program; Key Research and Development Program in Hubei Province	The research work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41977174 and 42020104005) , the 111 Program (State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs & the Ministry of Education of China, grant B18049) , National Key Research and Development Program (No.2021YFA0715900) and Key Research and Development Program in Hubei Province (No.2020BCA088) .		79	2	2	23	104	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0304-3894	1873-3336		J HAZARD MATER	J.

Ongoing climate warming and elevated CO2 in the atmosphere may affect nitrification in opposite directions. However, their interactions are not known, especially in the long-term and in flooded conditions common in paddy soils. We conducted a long-term (9 years) field experiment with simultaneous manipulation of temperature (+2 degrees C above ambient) and CO2 (+60-100 ppm above ambient) to evaluate the impacts of warming and CO2 enrichment on the community structure, diversity, and population size of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), soil nitrification and physico-chemical characteristics. Elevated CO2 increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content (18%), microbial biomass N (65%), and carbon (27%). These changes accompanied an increment in AOB functional-gene abundance (181%) and soil nitrification rate (96%). Elevated temperature also increased (58%) soil nitrification rate. The combination of warming and CO2 enrichment enhanced AOB gene abundance (232%) and nitrification rate (133%). Impacts of these climate change factors on nitrification strongly depended on AOB gene abundance and microbial biomass, but not on AOA abundance. Higher root C inputs by rhizodeposition and pH under these climate change factors explained the substantial increases in AOB gene abundance, as nutrient-rich and alkaline soils favor AOB growth. By contrast, the AOA community was less sensitive to these climate change factors. Community composition, diversity, and richness of nitrifiers were remarkably resilient in response to individual and interactive impacts of warming and elevated CO2. Consequently, climate change will increase AOB population size but without community restructuring and will increase nitrification in paddy soils, which enhances N availability with consequences for crop productivity, N2O emissions, and NO3- leaching.

J	Agrawal, M				Agrawal, Mahak			Multisector exposure and vulnerability to climate change in India: Case of National Capital Territory of Delhi, India	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Built environment; Economics of climate change; At-risk communities		Purpose The idea is to propagate the concept of climate resilience in India beyond international mandates and bold statements, enabled through utilization of open data. The research underscores need for climate responsive planning for megacities in India with an example of National Capital Territory of Delhi, the capital of India whose trends and policies often form a blueprint for others to follow. Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted in six distinct, yet inter-related stages: literature review, data collection, data analysis at four levels - city, zonal, planning division and flood plains inhabited by climate vulnerable population with least adaptive capacity, formulating alternative scenarios of future development, evaluation of scenarios, conclusions and recommendations. Findings India has approximately 8,000 urban centres. Less than 2% of these centres have a planning document. Less than 1% of these documents acknowledge climate change as a phenomenon let alone a challenge to urban future. It is therefore a priority to address the challenge from a planning perspective for India. Research limitations/implications Methodologies for evaluating the multiplier effect are still in their pre-final stage and there exist uncertainties and margin of error. Practical implications Aligned with pre-tested methodologies, the research through extensive empirical and spatial-temporal analysis indicates severity and irreversibility of socio-economic and environmental losses. Originality/value Risks and vulnerabilities to climate change and climate induced disasters exhibit multiplier effect that varies spatially across a region's demography. Quantitative analysis of multiplier effect on the secondary environment is rarely explored in climate studies. The paper addresses this lacuna by examining climate risks to Indian megacities with a case example of Delhi. The findings suggest that urbanization, climate risks and natural environment are interlinked, where an impact of one generates ripples across other two and their secondary environment plus sectors.

The presented method of the Regional Flood plain Evaluation Matrix (RegioFEM) is an integrative, interdisciplinary approach taking this into consideration. On the basis of seven parameters, the flood hazard, the hazard exposure and the damage potential are estimated for different planning variants and scenarios. The results of the application for a river reach of the river Raab in Austria for the two variants with 1) projected flood defence measures and infrastructure projects and 2) future settlement development, show that the flood risk is decreasing but is also leading to a strong negative impact on the runoff behaviour on a smaller scale.The benefit of the flood protection measures can clearly be seen by the decrease in damage potential by up to 72 % for the HQ(100) compared to the status quo, but at the same time this leads to an increase and to the acceleration of the flood wave in the adjacent river section. The possible impacts of climate change in a worst-case scenario (increased runoff-peak of 10 %) vary quite strongly on the local scale, which highlights the sensitivity of the whole system. The newly developed protection measures in the Raab case study are mostly unaffected by climate change, but existing structures in residential and industrial areas can be flooded, leading to an increase of the damage potential. The RegioFEM method has also been evaluated in a scientist-stakeholder workshop, where the integration into existing concept was also analysed. There, the interdisciplinary approach and the regional assessment has been stressed out as a very important aspect and a possible integration of the RegioFEM in the design of river development and risk management concepts (GERM) was also emphasised.

Nevertheless, studies on climate change impacts typically examine the changes in flow statistics only at the catchment outlet. In this study, we instead demonstrate the high variability of the hydrological response to climate change at the sub-catchment scale, investigating in detail the contribution of all components of the hydrological cycle in two mountainous catchments (Thur and Kleine Emme) in the Swiss Alps. The analysis was conducted with a two-dimensional weather generator model that simulated gridded climate variables at an hourly and 2-km resolution until the end of the 21st century for the RCP8.5 emission scenario. The climate ensemble was used as input into a distributed hydrological model to estimate the changes in hydrological processes at 100-m and hourly resolutions. Climate models show that precipitation intensifies during winter but weakens during summer in the order of +/- 5-10% toward the end of the century. Temperature will rise by up to 4.C, leading to a 50% reduction in snowmelt, 10% increase in evapotranspiration, and shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall. As a result, streamflow is projected to increase by 40% in winter but decrease by 20% to 40% during summer, with winter floods becoming more frequent. The changes to streamflow (mean and extreme low and high flows) at the sub-catchments show a strong dependency with elevation. In contrast to the small changes projected at the outlet of the catchments, streamflow shows a reduction at higher elevations (up to 20% change in mean streamflow for sub-catchments at elevations exceeding 1400 m) and an increase at lower elevations (up to +5% for Kleine Emme and +20% for the Thur at elevations below 600 m). These impacts are tied to the changes in precipitation, as well as changes in snowmelt (at high elevation) and evapotranspiration (at low elevation). The results reveal the causes and diversity of hydrological response to climate change, emphasizing the importance of investigating the distributed impacts of climate change in mountainous environments.

J	Muangsri, S; McWilliam, W; Davies, T				Muangsri, Suphicha; McWilliam, Wendy; Davies, Tim			The potential of industrial green stormwater infrastructure to provide long-term supplementary flood mitigation for low-lying coastal cities under climate change	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Coastal city; Climate change; Industrial land; Flood mitigation; Green stormwater infrastructure	URBAN; ADAPTATION; REDUCTION; SYSTEM	Coastal city flooding is projected to worsen in low-lying cities with climate change. Planners are concerned about the inadequacy of their current flood mitigation strategies, and the expense and risk of investing in expensive grey infrastructures, such as levees, under climate uncertainty. Implementing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) on large privately-owned industrial land may be an attractive alternative; however, little is known about its potential for providing supplementary flood mitigation with climate change. Using Christchurch, New Zealand, as a case study, we applied hydrological modelling and spatial analysis to assess its potential to keep the impact of the increased rainfall intensities within the current flood protection capacity. Increasing groundwater levels due to rising sea levels were also considered to determine land capability for in-ground retention of stormwater. Findings demonstrate significant capability in four out of six catchments to reduce the impact of climate change-induced increased runoff volume to within the current flood protection level in the medium term (2030-2050). Two of the catchments also reduced runoff to this level in the long term (2080-2100), and under much larger storm events than the design storm, though not under all climate scenarios. Long-term flood mitigation capability can be provided where industrial land occupies a large proportion of a catchment's area, is able to capture runoff from upstream, and where the high water table is deeper than 2 m. Industrial GSI has the potential to provide supplementary surface runoff containment through an adaptive flood mitigation planning strategy in response to unfolding climate change conditions.

System-Dynamics Approach to Multireservoir Energy Generation under Climate Change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Climate change; VENSIM; Efficiency indexes; System dynamics; Multireservoir hydropower system	HYDROPOWER GENERATION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; WATER	This paper evaluates several efficiency indexes of hydropower energy generation in Iran's Karkheh Basin water reservoir system (i.e., Seymareh and Karkheh Rivers) under climate change based on the system dynamics approach. The climate change effects are investigated with simulations of surface temperature and rainfall driven by downscaled climate projections from atmosphere-ocean circulation models in the current literature, and the models with the highest correlation and lowest error for rainfall and temperature in the 1976-2005 baseline period are identified. Rainfall and temperature are projected over two future periods, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, and are downscaled to basin scale. Results project that the basin temperature over future periods will be higher than in the baseline period. Downscaled results under climate change indicate that rainfall will not follow a specific pattern. An artificial neural network applied to predict runoff indicates that the runoff and flood peak will decrease. Software is implemented to simulate the operation of hydropower reservoirs in baseline and future periods. Five reservoir operation states are considered, with simulation results of energy production showing that runoff and energy production have a complex pattern. Seven indexes of hydropower reservoir efficiency are also calculated for the five operation states corresponding to targets of energy production.

These emerging changes must be linked with ecological functions of river systems to understand how climate change may affect freshwater biota. In this study we used a functional flows approach to analyze the ecological effects of changing streamflow patterns in snowmelt-dominated watersheds of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Our climate change modeling method combined ensemble Global Climate Models (GCMs) and decision scaling methods to incorporate the effects of GCM-projected changes in precipitation variability on streamflow patterns. Of climate parameters explored, air temperature causes the most change in functional flows, although precipitation variability compounds changes driven by air temperature. The greatest changes in ecologically-relevant streamflow patterns manifest as longer and drier dry season conditions, earlier snowmelt recession, and higher-magnitude peak flows. Although the directions of changes in functional flow metrics are largely consistent across models and watersheds, the magnitude of change depends strongly on human emissions levels. The analytical approach used in this study can serve as a model for integrating multiple approaches in hydroclimatic assessment of ecological change, and the results can help prioritize specific aspects of the flow regime for restoration efforts.

Historically, the economic dynamics of the city have been related to the extraction of natural resources, but little has been invested in local populations. The objectives of this paper are, first, to create a predictive scenario of urban growth linked to future climate projections for Esmeraldas, with a focus on vulnerability to landslides and flooding; and second, to generate methodological advances related to the linkage between urban growth simulation and the downscaling of global models for climate change. This paper is based on spatially explicit simulation, Cellular Automata (CA), to capture the dynamics of urban processes. CA is linked to the analysis of vulnerability to climate change based on socioeconomic conditions and is focused on flooding- and landslide-exposed areas. We found that the proportion of Afro-Ecuadorian people and the risk of landslides and flooding are positively related to urban growth. Based on our future scenarios, the urban growth area in Esmeraldas will increase 50% compared to the year 2016. Moreover, if the existing trends continue, natural vegetation-including mangroves-will be removed by that time, increasing the vulnerability to climate change.

Focussing on New Zealand, a climate-hydrology model cascade is used to project hydrological impacts of late 21st century climate change at 43,862 river locations across the country for seven hydrological metrics. Mean annual and seasonal river flows validate well across the whole model cascade, and the mean annual floods to a lesser extent, while low flows exhibit a large positive bias. Model projections show large swathes of non-significant effects across the country due to interannual variability and climate model uncertainty. Where changes are significant, mean annual, autumn, and spring flows increase along the west and south and decrease in the north and east. The largest and most extensive increases occur during winter, while during summer decreasing flows outnumber increasing. The mean annual flood increases more in the south, while mean annual low flows show both increases and decreases. These hydrological changes are likely to have important long-term implications for New Zealand's societal, cultural, economic, and environmental well-being.	[Collins, Daniel B.

We demonstrate an integrated approach to exploring these issues through the lens of a social-ecological system, combining remote and in-situ earth observations, hydrologic and climate models, and social surveys. Specifically, we examine how climate change and dam development could impact the Se Kong, Se San and Sre Pok rivers in the Mekong region. We find that climate change will lead to increased precipitation, necessitating a shift in dam operations, from maintaining low flows to reducing flood hazards. We also find that existing water governance systems in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are ill-prepared to address the problem. We conclude that the solution space for addressing these complex issues will be highly constrained unless major deficiencies in transboundary water governance, strategic planning, financial capacity, information sharing, and law enforcement are remedied in the next decades.

However, there has been little work done on characterizing the current and future changes in these services and their inter-relationships under a changing climate. Based on the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), the soil conservation service curve number model (SCS-CN), and the improved stochastic weather-generator-based statistical downscaled global climate models (GCMs), we examined two important water-related services, namely, the soil conservation (SC) service and the flood mitigation (FM) service, and their inter-relationship under baseline and future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5). We took the Upper Hanjiang River Basin (UHRB), which is the core water source area of the China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (S-NWDP), as an illustration. The findings revealed that (1) the SC and FM services will both decrease under the two climate scenarios examined; (2) the SC and FM services showed a significant synergistic inter-relationship and the synergy will be improved by 16.48% and 2.95% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, which provides an opportunity for management optimization; (3) the ecological degradation in the UHRB will likely have serious consequences for the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang river basin, and therefore impact the actual economic benefits of the S-NWDP. This study points to the necessity for understanding the dynamic changes and inter-relationships of ecosystem services under future climate change and provides information regarding the consequences of climate change, which is useful for policy and infrastructure investment.

J	Jackson, G				Jackson, Guy			Environmental subjectivities and experiences of climate extreme-driven loss and damage in northern Australia	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Climate extremes; Loss and damage; Environmental subjectivities; Australia	PERCEPTIONS; WEATHER; DROUGHT	Australia has objectively suffered climate extreme-driven loss and damage-climate change impacts that cannot or will not be avoided. Recent national surveys demonstrate a growing awareness of the link between climate change and climate extremes. However, climate extremes interact with existing environmental subjectivities (i.e., how people perceive, understand, and relate to the environment), which leads to different social, cultural, and political responses. For example, people in northern Australia are familiar with climate extremes, with the heat, humidity, fires, floods, storms, and droughts intimately connected to identities and sense of place. In this climate ethnography, I demonstrate the value of undertaking environmental subjectivities analyses for research on climate-society relations. I detail how environmental subjectivities influence people's experiences, or non-experiences, of climate extreme-driven loss and damage in northern Australia. I identify a growing concern for climate change and climate extremes are influencing environmental subjectivities. Yet, many northern Australians-even people concerned about climate change-are not, for now, connecting extreme events to climate change. A widespread subjectivity of anticipatory loss supplied people with an imagined temporal buffer, which contributes to non-urgency in political responses. Together with more structural political-economic barriers and a sense of helplessness to affect progressive change, limited action beyond individual consumer decisions and small-scale advocacy are occurring. These, amongst other, findings extend research on the role of climate extremes in climate opinion, lived experiences of loss and damage in affluent contexts, and the environmental value-action gap.

Two hydrological indicators of water security are considered both at the global and regional scales: mean river flow regime as an indicator of the provision of the territory with surface water resources, as well as the flood regime, as an indicator of flood hazard. The paper is structured as follows. The first section briefly discusses the current understanding of the mechanisms of the influence of anthropogenic climate change on water resources and flood hazard. The second section considers the methodological aspects of constructing assessments of the ongoing changes in the river regimes, and reviews some of the estimates of changes in water resources and high river flow in the world and Russia. The third section is devoted to the global and regional assessments of future changes in the river runoff regime in the twenty-first century and discusses the methodological challenges of carrying out such assessments. The fourth section evaluates socio-economic consequences of the current and forecasted hydrological changes and their influence on water security. The paper is finalized by several summarizing remarks.	[Gelfan, A. N.] Russian Acad Sci, Water Problems Inst, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Gelfan, A.

There is constant feedback among the multiple components of the system, and when climate changes, all facets of the system change. Abrupt shifts to different states can also take place when certain tipping points are crossed. The coupling of rapid warming in the Arctic with melting sea ice is one example of positive feedback. Climate changes, particularly rising sea temperatures, are causing an increasing frequency of tropical storms and "compound events" such as storm surges combined with torrential rains. These events are superimposed on progressive rises in relative sea level and are anticipated to push many coastal morphodynamic systems to tipping points beyond which return to preexisting conditions is unlikely. Complex systems modeling results and long-term sets of observations from diverse cases help to anticipate future coastal threats. Innovative engineering solutions are needed to adapt to changes in coastal landscapes and environmental risks. New understandings of cascading climate-change-related physical, ecological, socioeconomic effects, and multi-faceted morphodynamic systems are continually contributing to the imperative search for resilience. Recent contributions, summarized here, are based on theory, observations, numerically modeled results, regional case studies, and global projections.

Many natural disasters in East Asia are driven by TC (typhoon) activity in particular and their associated hazards are sensitive to local-scale characteristics. As such, it is critically important to numerically simulate TC activity (and other phenomenon) on local scales in order to properly assess climate change impacts on natural hazards in the region. In addition, projecting future changes of many TC-related hazards and/or their potential economic impacts can be challenging due to their low occurrence frequencies in any one particular area. With these views in mind, a collaborative research program was formed in Japan to project long-term changes in natural hazards in Japan and East Asia based on local-scale and large-ensemble numerical experiments. This paper reviews recent climate change impact assessments (written in both English and Japanese) from the program and summarizes the projected future changes in precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards, and their associated economic impacts.

However, these areas are commonly exposed to floods, and the increasing population together with the changes in storminess as a result of global warming mean that the risks from flooding are expected to rise. Most studies investigating the impact that climatic change has on flood risk are based on a cascade of global climate model simulations coupled with regional climate models, hydrologic models, inundation models, and flood impact models. However, this approach is subject to uncertainties. Model results are found to be sensitive to climate forcing, the structure of the underlying models, the choice of methods used for downscaling and bias correction, and the use of extreme value analysis for both current and future climate conditions. Moreover, uncertainties are expected to propagate through the model cascade. To overcome these problems, we propose a method for analyzing and mapping the sensitivity of population exposure in floodplains to changes in flood magnitude. The method is based on downward counterfactuals, namely perturbations of a selected flood scenario by increasing its magnitude, interpreted in this case as the worsening of a today's design flood event as a result of climatic changes. The increase in the impact of a current design flood compared to its counterfactual illustrates the sensitivity to changes in hazard. We calculate the normalized gradients of the flood exposure curves, that is, the increase in the exposure and magnitude of the perturbed event relative to the exposure and magnitude of the current scenario. We test the applicability of the method on local, national, and global scale by using existing data sets, including flood hazard maps, flood protection standards, floodplain delineation, river network definition, and spatial population distribution. The gradients were found to vary remarkably across the globe and are overall smaller in the upper range of flood magnitudes that in the lower range. Based on these results, we compare the drivers of the sensitivity in different parts of the world and identify river reaches with the highest relative gradients. These river reaches might be the most affected by climate change and thus deserve an in-depth investigation of the underlying characteristics of the floodplains and the need for climate change adaptation.

Study focus: Understanding the historical streamflow variability within basins is crucial to reduce the effect of utmost events, such as drought and floods on agriculture, fishery, and other human activities. The Least-Squares Wavelet software (LSWAVE) is applied to estimate the trend and seasonal components of sixty-year-long climate and discharge time series and to study the impact of climate change on streamflow over time. New hydrological insights for the region: The seasonal components of the discharge and precipitation time series including annual and semi-annual are coherent with phase discrepancy. The mean temperature has been gradually increasing since 1960, and it is projected to increase by approximately 2 degrees C during the mid-century which may reduce the snowpack volume during the spring. From the recurring pattern of spectral peaks in the spectrograms and jumps in the trend component of streamflow time series, the blue water is projected to increase during the midcentury, in particular in early 2030s. The results also highlight the potential of LSWAVE in analyzing climate and hydrological time series without any need for interpolation, gap-filling, and de-spiking.

In Karoun River basin, SW Iran, climate change is likely to affect nearly every aspect of surface and underground water. The outputs from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are applied in simulating the maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall changes in this basin. The assessments are tested based on the ability of models in reproducing the regional climatological trends. The best goodness of fit among RCP scenarios is involved through RCP 4.5. The simulated results of each scenario indicate a significant increase above 1 degrees C in the minimum temperature during warm months over most areas of the basin. The change in maximum temperature at most stations is linked to seasonal cold to warm transition months of the year. A reduction in autumn and winter rainfall and an increase in spring rainfall are expected for the coming three decades. The changes in rainfall pattern lead to a higher 24-h maximum precipitation which increases flooding probability especially at discharges greater than 2000m(3)/s.

However, theoretical consensus regarding climate risk insurance remains elusive, and the implementation of climate insurance policies varies markedly between countries owing to various challenges. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of 1082 relevant publications (1975-2022) to determine the theoretical basis, evolution of research hotspots, and methodologies associated with climate risk insurance. Climate insurance publications are growing at an average annual rate of 8.9%, with more than 2333 authors from 1103 organizations in 78 countries publishing on the subject. On the basis of milestones of global climate change assessment, i.e., the publication of the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate insurance research can be divided into three major phases. In the start-up phase (1975-2007), research schemes examined the feasibilities and potentials of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States, and the socioeconomic implications of transferring climate risk through reinsurance. The methodologies used in these studies were relatively simple owing to lack of comprehensive data. Research on flood insurance increased rapidly during the development phase (2008-2014), with increasing emphasis on the possibility of developing a flood insurance market in the Netherlands. Studies utilized catastrophe modeling and probabilistic approaches to estimate natural disaster losses and financial impacts. The boom phase (2015-2022) involved more research on the affordability of climate risk insurance given income inequality. The topic of climate insurance and the scope of its impact have developed global and interdisciplinary characteristics in terms of journal, sector, and disciplinary base. In the future, a trend might develop whereby big data will be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning to design and implement index insurance.

Although health care facilities (HCF) play a central role in the care of populations, there has been no compre-hensive assessment of the impact of CC on HCF. The objective of our study was to highlight the components of HCFs affected by CC through a mapping review of the literature.Methods: To meet our objective, we first assessed the place of HCFs in relation to CC in the scientific literature and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Bibliometric data from the PubMed database were analyzed between 1979 and 2021 to assess the penetration of keywords on CC alone, and in relation to health and HCF in particular. Second, we analyzed the changes in HCF keywords in the IPCC reports. Finally, we conducted a mapping review in five databases, of the international scientific literature published between 1979 and 2019, and identified the components of HCF affected by CC using the Ishikawa diagram. Results: From the 2000s, the number of publications on CC and HCF increased gradually with 137 articles in 2005, and even more sharply since 2008 with 358 articles published and 813 in 2021. Even though CC is only recently present in the biomedical literature, all climatic events (warming and heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms, hurricanes and cyclones, floods and sea-level rise, and other indirect effects) have had an impact on at least one component of HCF. Conclusion: HCFs are already impacted, in all their components, by CC. By enhancing our understanding of the impacts of CC on HCF, this work could contribute to the engagement of health professionals in the imple-mentation of mitigation and adaptation actions, thereby limiting the consequences of CC on patient care.

Valasht Lake is a mountainous basin desirable for studying sedimentation rates as off-site impacts of environmental changes. The research objective was to quantify the historical trend of sedimentation rate in response to anthropogenic and climate factors influencing the catchment of Valasht Lake. The sediment chronology performed using fallout radioisotopes (Ra-226, Cs-137, and Pb-210) and the Constant Rate of Supply Model. The off-site impacts of the whole complies of land use changes including deforestation and climate change resulted in sediment flux into the Valasht Lake with a mean rate of 0.94 kg m(-2) y(-1), since 1864. The studied sediment profile shows three different sedimentation periods manifested by three specific sediment layers with a mean sedimentation rate of 0.25 +/- 0.05 (1984-1964), 0.76 +/- 0.17 (1964-2006), and 2.28 +/- 0.7 (after 2006) kg m(-2) yr(-1). During the forming of layers, the annual sediment yield has been 50, 152, and 456 tonnes, which infers land degradation and an increase in flash flood frequency. The Pb-210 dating method revealed extreme events of sediment deliveries, especially in 1963, 1983, 2002, 2007, and 2011-2019 years. Organic-rich mud deposits (TOC, 17.9 +/- 4%) accumulated during the last period since 2006. It can be attributed to the increasing trend of burning the forest clear-cuts and ash flux into the lake. Integrated watershed management practices and desirable land-use planning are recommended to preserve the natural resources of Valasht Lake and its catchment.

The concept of stationarity has been a common and practical hypothesis in hydrology for many years. However, in recent decades due to climate change pressure and changes in land use, it has been related to the presence of time-series trends that in hydrology indicate non-stationary effects. In this sense, the need to comprehensively address non-stationary frequency analysis has been identified. This study proposes to incorporate the non-stationary flood frequency analysis into the dimensioning process of road structures with the following objectives: i) evaluate the effect of land use on peak flow in a simulated period of 129 years, ii) evaluate covariates related to land use, and iii) evaluate covariates related to climate change. To this end, road drainage simulation exercises were carried out in three sections of the Ibague-Cajamarca road located in Colombia. Likewise, the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape was implemented for the non-stationary analysis, and covariates related to climate variability were included, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation indices (ONI12, ONI3.4, MEI, and SOI), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, as well as some related to the evolution of land use such as hydraulic conductivity, soil water storage in the root zone, and infiltration capacity represented in the curve number. The results indicate that the non-stationary analysis improves the prediction of maximum flows, and it is possible to obtain road drainage dimensioning that adjusts to climate and land-use variations.

The Amazon basin has been subjected to extreme climatic events and according to climate change projections this hydrosystem could face changes in the natural dynamic of flood cycles that support the feeding and reproduction of many fish species, threatening aquatic biodiversity. 2. Protected areas (PAs) are the main tools used to safeguard the biodiversity in the long term; however, they are fixed areas that could be subject to climate change, questioning their future efficiency in protecting biodiversity. 3. The Amazon basin currently benefits from a relatively high level of protection as 52% of its catchment area is under the form of true PAs or indigenous lands. However, the capacity of these PAs to protect freshwater biodiversity remains unclear as they have generally been assessed with little regard to freshwater ecosystems and their hydrological connectivity. Here, the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs in representing the Amazon fish fauna under current and future climatic conditions. 4. A macroecological approach was used to estimate the minimum size of the geographical range needed by each species to achieve long-term persistence, by a combined function of range size and body size, two ecological traits known to influence species extinction risk. 5. In future the Amazon basin could risk losing 2% of its freshwater fish fauna owing to unsuitable climatic conditions, with a further 34% adversely affected. The present Amazon network of PAs will cover the minimum required range for species persistence for more than 60% of the freshwater fish species analysed under the future climate scenario. However, more than 25% of the future susceptible species are currently concentrated in large tributaries and in the central-lower Amazon floodplain where few PAs occur, highlighting the lack of appropriate conservation actions for these specific water bodies.

The objective of this study was to estimate the inflow design flood interval using a non-parametric resampling technique for agricultural reservoirs under climate change. This study suggested an alternative method to point estimation using insufficient past data by providing the interval of the inflow design flood under the representative concentration pathway. To estimate the interval of the inflow design flood, we employed the bootstrap technique, which estimated the confidence interval corresponding to the 95% confidence level. This study covered a spatial range of 30 agricultural reservoirs in South Korea and a temporal range of past and three future representative periods: the base period (2015s: 1986-2015) and future periods (2040s: 2011-2040, 2070s: 2041-2070, 2100s: 2071-2100). We analyzed the results of a 200-year return period and 24-hour duration as a representative case. For the 97.5th bias-corrected and accelerated percentile value, the overall inflow design floods were larger than the base period value (2015s) with the safety factor applied. The northern and midwestern regions of South Korea showed relatively greater changes than the southeastern region. Some agricultural reservoirs showed a decrease in the design flood during the 2040s but generally increased after the 2070s. Through the non-parametric resampling technique, the interval estimation was provided considering the uncertainty of the inflow design flood. By presenting the results for three periods, we can provide policymakers with information to select according to the target period. The findings may provide an essential step in replacing a safety factor used for determining the design flood of agricultural reservoirs with the confidence interval calculated in accordance with statistical characteristics.

Assessing future trends in probabilistic urban flood risk can improve uncertainty estimation of urban floods under climate change, and thus it is becoming increasingly urgent and important. In this study, a probabilistic risk assessment approach of urban flooding was developed to quantify the probabilistic flood risk in urban areas and assess the impacts of future climate change on flood risk. Results showed probabilistic urban flood risk under the historical condition ranged from 0 to 0.508 with a mean value of 0.104, indicating probabilistic urban flood risk was at the medium risk level. The areas where probabilistic flood risk reached the medium risk level under historical condition accounted for 34.3 % of the study area. The ranges of probabilistic flood risk in the study area were 0-0.588 and 0-0.601 with mean values of 0.126 and 0.131 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 climate change scenarios, respec-tively. The areas where probabilistic flood risk reached the high risk level respectively accounted for 17.1 % and 32.7 % of the study area for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Compared with the historical period, probabilistic risk of urban flooding in the study area was projected to increase by 51.3 % and 67.4 % on average for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. The largest increase of probabilistic flood risk was approximately 200 % and 250 % for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, which mainly occurred for forestlands and grasslands. These results can effectively improve the uncertainty estimation of risk trends for urban floods under future climate change, and thus better-informed decision making for urban flood prevention.

We addressed this question for salmon populations with varying life histories, where resilience is defined as maintaining or increasing population size despite climate change effects. Previous studies indicate that several interrelated mechanisms may influence salmon resilience to climate change, including improving either habitat capacity or productivity, and ameliorating climate change effects on flood flow, low flow, or stream temperature. Using the Habitat Assessment and Restoration Planning (HARP) model, we first examined the relative importance of each mechanism for increasing salmon population resilience by comparing projected salmon spawner abundance for seven individual restoration action types under current and projected mid- and late-century climates. We found that restoring habitats with the greatest restoration potential most increased resilience for all species, but the most beneficial restoration actions varied among species. Increasing habitat capacity and productivity both contributed to resilience, and ameliorating climate change effects was important in a few subbasins where the restoration opportunity was widespread. Cool-water climate refuges contributed to resilience of some subpopulations by reducing late-century declines in spawner abundance even without restoration. We also modeled more complex habitat restoration strategies comprised of several restoration action types at varying restoration intensities and found that the restoration action types and level of restoration effort needed to increase resilience varied among species. Less vulnerable species such as coho salmon responded well to four restoration actions (floodplain reconnection, wood augmentation, increased shade, and increased beaver ponds) applied at low restoration intensity and over a large area. More vulnerable species such as spring Chinook responded to fewer action types (floodplain reconnection, wood augmentation, and increased shade), but at much higher intensity and over a much smaller area. The analysis also identified important locations for each restoration action type for each species, which helps focus habitat restoration effort on areas that are likely to provide the largest increases in resilience.

Frequently, dynamically downscaled climate inputs are used in conjunction with land-surface models (LSMs) to provide hydrologic streamflow projections, which serve as critical inputs for WMMs. Here, we show how even modest projection errors can strongly affect assessments of water availability and financial stability for irrigation districts in California. Specifically, our results highlight that LSM errors in projections of flood and drought extremes are highly interactive across timescales, path-dependent, and can be amplified when modeling infrastructure systems (e.g., misrepresenting banked groundwater). Common strategies for reducing errors in deterministic LSM hydrologic projections (e.g., bias correction) can themselves strongly distort projected climate vulnerabilities and misrepresent their inferred financial consequences. Overall, our results indicate a need to move beyond standard deterministic climate projection and error management frameworks that are dependent on single simulated climate change scenario outcomes.

However, there is still no enough research on how the effects of extreme weather events could be measured on the farm level. More importantly, there is no standard international methodology that is used regularly to address the issue. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of extreme weather events on business performances of two the most common farm types in Serbia. To achieve this goal, the authors performed a financial loss assessment on a farm level. Panel models and R software environment were used to perform a multiple regression analysis allowing to indicate determinants of financial loss indicator depending on the farm's production type. The results indicated that performance of both farm types is more influenced by drought than by floods. The regression analysis revealed that for both farm types financial stress is the most important independent variable.

In this study, we simulated the impacts of sea level rise and storm surge obtained from geographic and past typhoon data (obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute and the Meteorological Administration and National Oceanographic Research Institute) to predict flooding in Yeosu, Korea. Digital surface models were generated from airborne laser scanning to accurately simulate the effect of flooding, and we identified areas and infrastructure at high risk from future flood damage using the predicted significant wave height rise and a region-growing algorithm. Finally, the need to develop a regional disaster plan in response to climate change is proposed.

From Flood to Drip Irrigation Under Climate Change: Impacts on Evapotranspiration and Groundwater Recharge in the Mediterranean Region of Valencia (Spain)	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						Climate change impact; drip irrigation; groundwater recharge; irrigated agriculture; Mediterranean region; water resources	JUCAR RIVER-BASIN; WATER CONSERVATION; AQUIFER; AGRICULTURE; FUTURE; REQUIREMENTS; VULNERABILITY; COEFFICIENT; UNCERTAINTY; EFFICIENCY	Agricultural irrigation is the major water consumer in the Mediterranean region. In response to the growing pressure on freshwater resources, more efficient irrigation technologies have been widely promoted. In this study, we assess the impact of the ongoing transition from flood to drip irrigation on future hydroclimatic regimes under various climate change scenarios, with a particular focus on actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge in the Mediterranean region of Valencia, Spain. Hydroclimatic predictions for the near-term future (2020-2049) and the mid-term future (2045-2074) were made under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) using a hydrological model that was forced with data from five GCM-RCM combinations and field-based irrigation volume and frequency observations. Our findings suggest that climate change could lead to statistically significant changes in the regional hydroclimatic regime despite projection uncertainties. Major changes include a statistically significant decrease in mean groundwater recharge of up to -6.6% under flood irrigation and -9.3% under drip irrigation and contrasting changes in mean actual evapotranspiration for flood and drip irrigation in the order of +1% and -2.1%, respectively. Since sustainably available water resources in the Valencia region are entirely allocated, the expected changes and associated uncertainties create a challenging context for future water management. Our simulations further indicate that, rather than climate change, the choice of irrigation technique may have a greater impact on actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Our findings therefore highlight the importance of considering both climate change and irrigation technique when assessing future water resources in irrigated Mediterranean agriculture.

J	Ghosh, M; Ghosal, S				Ghosh, Manoranjan; Ghosal, Somnath			Determinants of household livelihood vulnerabilities to climate change in the himalayan foothills of West Bengal, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Livelihood vulnerability; Income loss; Crop loss; Housing loss; Livelihood loss; Climate change	CHANGE IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; INDEX; WATER; SOUTH	The impact of climate change and variability on household livelihood in the Himalayan region is hardly studied due to their locational inaccessibility. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to determine the factors which affect rural household vulnerability in sub-Himalayan West Bengal, India. How the socio-economic conditions of the households and climate change have been affecting the overall livelihood of this region? To understand the determining factors of household livelihood vulnerabilities, four main domains of vulnerabilities have been considered, namely, 'income loss', 'crop loss', 'housing loss', and 'overall livelihood loss' due to climate changes. The study has applied ordinal logistic regression along with focus group discussion to find out the determining factors. The survey data shows that specific variables such as the size of agricultural land, occupation of the households' heads, caste, membership of self-help groups, and perception of precipitation trends are the main determining factors of income loss in maximum households. Moreover, housing type, mainly non-concrete and semi-concrete houses are responsible for household vulnerability to climate change. Every household of this region loses a significant amount of crop due to the heavy rainfall or floods; although several households have adopted new resilient crop varieties. Nevertheless, crop loss is a major climatic threat in the sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal. Further, the results of the present study also suggest that the low adaptive capacity of the rural households of this region, such as low-income opportunities and inadequate infrastructure are the primarily reasons for most livelihood vulnerabilities.

In this study, possible future changes of seasonality, magnitude and frequency characteristics of ROS floods were investigated for the selected catchments in Slovenia, Europe. For this purpose, five global/regional climate models (GCM/RCM) combinations were applied using the RCP4.5 climate scenario for the period 1981-2100. To determine ROS floods' characteristics in the future, a lumped conceptual hydrological model Genie Rural a 6 parametres Journalier (GR6J) with snow module CemaNeige was applied. The results indicate that the number of ROS floods could increase in the future. Moreover, also the magnitudes of extreme ROS floods could increase, while a slight decrease in the median values of ROS flood magnitudes was observed. The strength of seasonality for a high-altitude catchment could decrease in the future. A slight shift in the average ROS floods' timing could be expected. Furthermore, a catchment located in a temperate continental climate could have a different response to the climate change impact in comparison to a catchment located in a mountain climate with alpine characteristics. Additionally, differences among investigated climate models show a large variability.

Waterlogging is an inevitable consequence of these changes but its effects on oil palms have received little attention and are poorly understood. Recent waterlogging studies have focused on oil palm seedlings, with particular emphasis on phenology. However, the transcriptomic waterlogging response of mature oil palms remains elusive in real environments. We therefore investigated transcriptomic changes over time in adult oil palms at plantations over a two-year period with pronounced seasonal variation in precipitation. A significant transcriptional waterlogging response was observed in the oil palm stem core but not in leaf samples when gene expression was correlated with cumulative precipitation over two-day periods. Pathways and processes upregulated or enriched in the stem core response included hypoxia, ethylene signaling, and carbon metabolism. Post-waterlogging recovery in oil palms was found to be associated with responses to heat stress and carotenoid biosynthesis. Nineteen transcription factors (TFs) potentially involved in the waterlogging response of mature oil palms were also identified. These data provide new insights into the transcriptomic responses of planted oil palms to waterlogging and offer valuable guidance on the sensitivity of oil palm plantations to future climate changes.

Hence, this study assessed the projected climate change impact on streamflow and SSL based on CMIP6 projections in the flood-prone Mahanadi River Basin (MRB) using the SWAT model. Bias-corrected climate data from five global climate models under medium and extreme shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) were utilized as an input to the SWAT model for the baseline (1985-2014), near future (NF, 2020-2046), and mid future (MF, 2047-2073) periods. Rainfall is expected to increase by 2.86% (2.19%) and 13.35% (16.98%) in the NF and MF, respectively, under SSP245 (SSP585). Streamflow and SSL may increase by 6.38% (6.06%) and 4.43% (7.89%) in the NF and by 29.78% (36.90%) and 37% (46.43%) in the MF, respectively, under SSP245 (SSP585) scenario. Also, streamflow and SSL exhibited an increasing trend in most months as well as in most seasons. The findings may be helpful to decision-makers in identifying watershed management plans by offering more information on how climate change affects the hydro-sedimentological processes in a flood-prone river basin.

The present systematic study tried to review literature examining the relationship between meteorological conditions and WRDs in developing countries located in Western Asia. We searched Scopus, PubMed and Embase for studies describing the relationship between WRDs and climate variables (ambient temperature, rainfall and humidity) plus extreme events, drought and flooding. A total of 27 articles met the inclusion criteria. The key findings presented a positive association between temperature and WRDs in most of the evaluated records. However, rainfall and humidity showed inconsistent relationships with WRDs. No evidence was found reporting the effect of climate variables on water-based or water-washed diseases. Yemen is the only country in the studied region that still has major issues controlling WRDs and might be at greater risk of climate change. It is recommended that future researches evaluate the delayed effects of environmental factors on WRDs and multidimensional interactions of climate variables on each other or on socioeconomic variables affecting WRDs. Increased health risks due to climate change add additional value to the investigations studying the proven adaptation strategies such as improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) and effective early warning systems.

We used Eichhornia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes, two abundant aquatic plants in the Amazon floodplains, to evaluate the effects of combined temperature and [CO2] increase on growth, physiology and ecological interactions. Individual and paired plants were deposited for three weeks in a microcosm under four IPCC scenarios: control (current temperature/CO2), mild (control + 1.5 degrees C, 200 ppm CO2), intermediate (control + 2.5 degrees C, 450 ppm CO2) and extreme (control + 3.5 degrees C, 850 ppm CO2). P. stratiotes died after three weeks in the intermediate and extreme treatments; E. crassipes experienced no mortality or change in any of the measured variables during the same period. P. stratiotes reduced root length in the mild treatment and reduced total dry biomass in intermediate and extreme treatments, revealing less tolerance to climate change. Ecological interactions between the two species changed with increasing [CO2] and temperature neutral interaction changed to facilitation for E. crassipes, while competitive interaction changed to neutral for P. stratiotes. Global climate change may alter the composition, biomass and ecological interactions of Amazonian aquatic plant species.

CoastAdapt: an adaptation decision support framework for Australia's coastal managers	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCIENCE; INFORMATION; COPRODUCTION; TOOLS	Australia's coastline is exposed to climate change and sea-level rise impacts from erosion, inundation, and changes to storm tracks and intensity. It accommodates about 80% of the population. Around 250 local councils are responsible for coastal management, with very different capacities to undertake adaptation. A decision support framework was developed to support coastal managers seeking to understand present-day and future climate change, its impacts and possible response options. Extensive engagement was undertaken with practitioners before commencing the design and at all stages of the build, in order to ensure usefulness and usability. The resulting framework, CoastAdapt (coastadapt.com.au), provides comprehensive guidance and support, including understanding of climate change science, expected impacts, and adaptation options. It contains datasets on historical flooding; present-day coastal sensitivity to erosion; and future climate extremes, sea-level rise, and inundation for each coastal council. A risk management framework supports users through the six stages of adaptation from identifying the challenges through to monitoring and evaluation. The performance of CoastAdapt has been evaluated through 11 6-week test cases with coastal managers in the public and private sectors. In future, if CoastAdapt is to remain a useful resource, it must be seen by practitioners as dynamic, relevant, and current, and on-going resources will be needed to achieve this.	[Palutikof, J.

Therefore, there is a need to better understand how the dynamics of riparian communities are influenced by climate change and how its impacts can be assessed. Using Bangladesh as an example, this paper describes the various climate stressors affecting riparian communities and their socio-economic impacts, and it outlines some measures needed to increase their resilience to a changing climate. The results show that riparian communities are not only quite vulnerable to the impacts of climate change but also have a rather low level of resilience. This challenge can, at least in part, be attributed to their fragile living conditions, which intensify the socio-economic impacts of extreme events. One lesson from the paper is that handling climate-induced risks in riparian communities requires implementing strategic measures to improve local climate and livelihood resilience, such as effective public health infrastructure and a resilient built environment. Win-win scenarios comprise strategies that offer multiple benefits including better water storage, flood control, and improved riparian habitats.

By 2011, a new character joined the discourse: the trapped figure. No longer would climatically vulnerable people be forced to move, they could also end up immobile. This review examines the narratives that surround the trapped figure. The article highlights the trapped figure's (i) characterisation, (ii) geography, and (iii) storytellers. The material includes the 2011 Foresight Report, 64 English peer-reviewed journal articles, and seven UNFCCC policy reports. The textual analysis furthers our understanding of the values that shape the meaning of the trapped figure within the wider discursive economy. Out of the 64 articles, 48 located the trapped figure in Asia, while 34 placed the figure in Africa. Meanwhile, the majority of articles-62 in total-were written by scholars based at European research institutes. The study shows that the trapped figure, much as the mythical climate refugee and migrant, is constructed as both a victim in need of rescuing and as an ambiguous security threat. It is ethically problematic that planned relocation was often put forward as an effective tool to "move" the figure out of harm's way. The review also found a range of binary opposites in the discourse on trapped populations, including those of order-disorder, freedom-unfreedom, and victim-savior. This suggests that however well-intentioned the liberal discourse on trapped populations appear, it remains embedded in power relations which demands for critical scrutiny.

However, they lack long-term systematic monitoring and thus their responses to recent climatic change still remain only partially understood. This study investigated lake extent fluctuations in the HKHT regions over the past 40 years using Landsat (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI) images obtained from the 1970s to 2014. Influenced by different regional atmospheric circulation systems, our results show that lake changing patterns are distinct from region to region, with the most intensive lake shrinking observed in northeastern HKHT (HKHT Interior, Tarim, Yellow, Yangtze), while the most extensive expansion was observed in the western and southwestern HKHT (Amu Darya, Ganges Indus and Brahmaputra), largely caused by the proliferation of small lakes in high-altitude regions during 1970s-1995. In the past 20 years, extensive lake expansions (similar to 39.6% in area and similar to 119.1% in quantity) were observed in all HKHT regions. Climate change, especially precipitation change, is the major driving force to the changing dynamics of the lake fluctuations; however, effects from the glacier melting were also significant, which contributed approximately 31.9-40.5%, 16.5-39.3%, 12.8-29.0%, and 3.3-6.1% of runoff to lakes in the headwaters of the Tarim, Amu Darya, Indus, and Ganges, respectively. We consider that the findings in this paper could have both immediate and long-term implications for dealing with water-related hazards, controlling glacial lake outburst floods, and securing water resources in the HKHT regions, which contain the headwater sources for some of the largest rivers in Asia that sustain 1.3 billion people.

The use of global indicators has not been a sustainable solution, thus the need for local indicators. Besides, current sustainability assessment tools lack the integration of climate, making assessments in a climate change context impossible. In this paper, we present management and sustainability assessment in a climate change context using sustainability indicators. We modeled a change in the climate using normal, moderate, and extreme climate conditions defined by Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) values. Out of 36 years analyzed, 24 years fall in the near-normal climate regime, and the remaining 12 years in moderate and extreme conditions, making near-normal climate regime the basis for managing the Taabo Dam. The impact of climate, techno-economic, and socio-environmental indicators on sustainability were investigated, and the results were analyzed according to scenarios. Climate adaptation shows higher sustainability indices than techno-economic and socio-environmental scenarios. Probability matrices show high and low values, respectively, for environmental and flooding indicators. Risk matrices, on the other hand, show that even with small probability values, risks still exist, and such small probabilities should not be taken as an absence of risk.

This paper aims to demonstrate that the available GIS technologies and large, variable, and diverse datasets (big data) already allow us to create effective, easy-to-use, and, most importantly, cross-sectorial and holistic tools that integrate issues related to planning, flood risk management, and adaptation to climate change. Resulting from an interdisciplinary study of districts in Krakow, Poland, which have been heavily affected by pluvial floods in recent years, the accumulated runoff mapping analysis method proposed in this paper can be considered an effective planning tool that can be used at the initial stage of pluvial flood risk assessment and, above all, for spatial planning analysis and urban design. The proposed tool accounts for a correlation of development, land cover, and hydrological conditions, as well as their impact on vulnerability and the urban climate, while integrating environmental, urban, and social amenities. Intended for preliminary planning phases, it uses open-source software and data, which, although giving approximate runoff volumes, do not require advanced hydrological calculations or costly and time-consuming field research. The method allows studying alternative scenarios that can support the cross-sectorial, inclusive, and interdisciplinary discussion on new developments, sustainable planning, and adaptation to climate change. Most importantly, it can reduce, if not eliminate, issuing decisions that may have negative impacts on urban areas and enhance their resilience before more sophisticated, detailed, and advanced methods are ready for implementation.

Also, the Batanghari watershed Land use changes have shown a decreasing forest cover and an increasing agricultural area. Therefore, this study aims to calculate the impact of land use and climate change on water and sediment yield using Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) hydrological modeling. Land-use change analysis was performed with projections in 2040 while, near future and future climate projections under Representative Concentration Pathway (R.C.P.) 4.5 and 8.5 were used for global climate change scenarios. The results show a changing pattern of growing agricultural area and decreasing forest area in 1990, 1997, 2005, 2015, and 2040. SWAT hydrological model used for the simulation was calibrated automatically with SWAT-CUP and the results were validated on good criteria. The sensitivity analysis results showed that effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium (CH_K2) and Base flow alfa factor (Alfa_BF) formed the most sensitive parameters for discharge. Furthermore, the model simulation showed an increase in surface runoff and a decrease in lateral flow and base flow due to land-use changes, which increased sediment loading over time. The impact of climate change on water and sediment yield increased the average flow discharge ratio, resulting in more frequent droughts and floods events.

Numerous threats, including global climate change and various human activities, affect both the quantity and quality of fresh water available. Here we carried out a case study of Xiamen, a coastal city in subtropical China. Long-term data analysis showed the increasing floods and droughts that are the expected main impacts of climate change on water quality and quantity. Increasing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in recent decades threaten water quality in Jiangdong reservoir, which supplies raw water to Xiamen and other coastal areas. In addition to excessive manganese (Mn) in surface water, other potential threats to water quality and human health include various emerging contaminants; these threats have all been scientifically detected but are beyond the scope of routine water-monitoring programs. Based on lessons learned from water supply management initiatives currently in progress, we proposed a conceptual framework for "source-to-tap" integrated water management in an attempt to secure clean and safe water supply. Long-term monitoring and research, adaptive management and actions to reduce nutrients and other pollutants loading are vital to protect water sources, and measures to adapt to climate change should be considered to achieve these goals. Institutional enablers for transboundary and cross-sector management were also suggested: enacting integrated water policies, developing an ecological compensation policy, authorizing the management institution, improving the incentive mechanism of cross-border compensation and transfer payments considering environmental responsibility, and encouraging multiple-stakeholder involvement.

J	El-Zein, A; Ahmed, T; Tonmoy, F				El-Zein, Abbas; Ahmed, Tanvir; Tonmoy, Fahim			Geophysical and social vulnerability to floods at municipal scale under climate change: The case of an inner-city suburb of Sydney	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Flood; Vulnerability; Social vulnerability; Climate change; Sea level rise; Municipal planning	RISK-MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CHANGE IMPACTS; RIVER-FLOODS; URBAN AREAS; HAZARD; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; FUTURE	Assessments of vulnerability to flooding can generate useful data for planners and policy makers. To the best of the authors knowledge, no flood-vulnerability study has combined geophysical modelling of floods with socioeconomic assessments of vulnerability at finer municipal or household scale. In addition, the extent to which vulnerability assessments actually feed into flood adaptation policies remains largely unknown. A new flood vulnerability index, and associated methodology, is proposed, combining high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling with built-environment and socio-economic indicators at the smallest spatial scale at which socio-economic data is available. The main advantage of the methodology is its ability to incorporate place-specific data, hence yielding more refined simulations of floods and the capacity to make projections into climate futures at local scale. The index is built and applied to the inter-city suburb of Marrickville in Sydney and used to assess the effects of future climate change on vulnerability mapping in the suburb. Finally, the results of the assessment are presented to, and discussed with, the local government authority responsible for implementing flood adaptation policies for Marrickville. Locally specific modelling of floods, combined with socio-economic and built-environment mapping, has yielded a rich set of information on flood vulnerability and significant variability within a single suburb. Flood duration is projected to increase by more than 100% under some climate change scenarios, as a result of reduced drainage caused by sea level rise. Feedback from municipal council has highlighted the potential usefulness of the knowledge generated by the assessment, especially for emergency services.

It causes minor and real changes in the climatic changes. The time and space analyzed on the data and the spatial and temporal patterns are introduced in the required manner. For the unpredictable data to be predicted by using the spatial interpolation techniques. The major spatial interpolation methods are categorized based on the simple and complex mathematical modeling. Those studies involve interpolation techniques such as ordinary Krigging, inverse distance weighted (IDW), Spline, etc., Most of the techniques studied the hydrological modeling and deliver hydro mapping (Younghun Jung and Venkatesh Merwade2015). Various techniques are used for the hydrological mapping. This study involved comparing the statistical interpolation with precipitation and temperature. The cumulative values in the dataset taken from the year 2001 to the year 2013 used in the study. The monthly and the yearly mean square value calculated using the spatial interpolation techniques (Dhamodarn and Shruthi2016). The main objective of the study is to find the topographical features and provides high-resolution climate maps using mathematical modeling. In the result of comparing the above interpolation methods in the result will produce the high-resolution climate maps and generate the geographical patterns. Based on the study will produce climate change in the environment like disaster, flood, landslide. The comparative study of interpolation methods and mean variation can be resulted and used for the further implementation of spatial climatic condition and decision support system to the society. The area has undergone the study is Adyar river, situated in latitude 13.0012 degrees N, Longitude 80.2565 degrees E. Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation methods are analyzed by using the Geostatistical tool ArcGIS.

Twenty-first century climate change is expected to alter these flood mechanisms. In this study, a coastal city of Cork, Ireland is used as a case study to investigate changes in flood mechanisms, dynamics and extents due to climate change. A hydrodynamic flood model MSN_Flood was used to compute potential future inundation patterns for a range of climate scenarios based on estimates of current, medium-range and high-end projections of extreme river flows and sea levels. Results illustrate that the flood mechanism is critical in controlling patterns and extent of inundation. Peak river discharges are the primary contributor to extreme flood events under the current climate scenario, however, high-end climate change could result in coastal inundation of comparable magnitude. The most extreme flood events affect the entire city centre - occurring as a result of a combination of fluvial and coastal drivers. The interaction of extreme fluvial discharges and coastal water levels is complex and characterised through comparison of multiple scenarios. This research establishes a best practice methodology for assessment of urban coastal-fluvial flood risk under a changing climate and can be used to determine climate-resilient flood management measures.

However, the degree and nature of climate-civilization link are still a matter of debate. Fluvial deposits preserved within a cultural stratigraphical context at archaeological sites in the lower Yellow River area may offer an exceptional framework for evaluating the role of climate changes in the rise and fall of ancient civilizations. Here we show evidence for great lower Yellow River floods during the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition about 4000-3500 years ago. Comparing with existing terrestrial and marine records suggests that they were a downstream manifestation of flooding in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, most likely triggered by excessive summer precipitation while a weak El Nino condition prevailed. The floods substantially modified the preexisting landscape and altered the agricultural conditions, thereby driving people dwelling on the higher mounds to move upward. Our results provide a past analogue of the linked climatic, environmental, and societal changes at a time when large and rapid climate changes occurred. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that climate change already has significant impact on magnitude and frequency of flood events worldwide. Thus, it is suggested to adopt strategies to manage damage impacts of climate change. For this, involving the local community in the decision-making process, as well as experts and decision-makers, is essential. We focused on assessing the social acceptability of flood management strategies under climate change through a socio-hydrological approach using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). For this purpose as well, hydro-climate modelling and the Analytical Network Process (ANP) were used. Among twelve investigated flood management strategies, "river restoration", "agricultural management and planning", and "watershed management" were the publicly most accepted strategies. Assessment of the social acceptability of these three strategies was carried out by use of the CVM and Willingness to Pay (WTP) methodology. Generally, 50%, 38%, and 18% were willing to pay and 44%, 48%, and 52% were willing to contribute flood management strategy in zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Overall, peoples' WTP for flood management strategies decreased with increasing distance from the river. Among different investigated dependent variables, household income had the highest influence on WTP.

Starting from a comparative analysis of four Italian cities in the Central Veneto Area, the aim is to understand how plans and regulations have already directed their efforts toward adaptation and climate risk reduction over the years, without explicitly labelling these measures as such. This process is carried out by co-ordinating the technicians of local administrations in the recognition and classification of already active measures that can be brought within the framework of combating the effects of climate change. The analysis of the identified measures shows that there is already considerable attention to flooding-related and heat-related issues in the local planning corpus. Understanding this dimension of local planning allows access to a set of adaptation intervention models that are already integrated into the planning system and support incorporating adaptation practices in a more co-ordinated way at various planning levels.

Climate change and coastal policy: the need to address erosion-flooding interactions for effective coastal risk management	GEOGRAPHY			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; EXTREME-WEATHER; STORM IMPACTS; COASTLINE; WINTER	Global climate change is giving rise to a world characterised by novel human-environment interactions. At the coast, higher than average population growth, concentrated within static conurbations means that climatic changes here are likely to generate high-risk outcomes. Coastal erosion and flooding are two such outcomes with the potential to cause trillions of pounds worth of losses in the near future. Many studies have sought to quantify the extent of erosion and flooding in various locations. However, there is a lack of research into the interaction between erosion and flooding. This article explores the importance of erosion-flooding interaction for effective coastal risk management policy. Blakeney Point, a mixed sand-gravel barrier on the UK's North Norfolk coast, is used to explore three expressions of erosion-flooding interaction: the role of coastal morphology, the importance of shoreline position, and the occurrence of extreme storm events. At Blakeney Point, and elsewhere, the potential for unforeseen risk-generating scenarios suggests that erosion-flooding interaction ought to be incorporated into future coastal risk management policy.

There is no doubt that the future climate change will substantially affect precipitation amount, discharge and hydro-meteorology which are considered as major sources for hydropower energy. In this study, we present an application of downscaling technique on prediction of discharge of a local gage station in Turkey. Variable input set of the Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model variables are statistically downscaled and coupled with variable forms of local discharge (Q, LnQ, MavQ, StdQ, and Q/Qmax) by using five different models as Gene-expression programming, Group Method of Data Handling, K-nearest neighbour, logistic regression and linear regression. Different sub-models are developed and calibrated based on the training period, and the best model is selected based on the testing period. Future projecting of discharge is done based on the Third Generation Coupled Global Climate Model A2 scenario, and the financial analysis is carried out by using this forecasted Q values.

The different roles played by policy actors and their interactions shape the process of adaptation governance. Nevertheless, to date, there has been limited attention paid to how the structure of relations and their associated power dynamics between these actors affect adaptation governance process at different levels. In this study, we analyzed the structure, processes, and power dynamics entailed in the multilevel governance of adaptation to floods in coastal areas of Bangladesh. We used social network analysis approach to map and unpack the interactions between actors that influence the adaptation governance. We categorized five types of organizations based on the structural attributes of the governance network and their functions. Our analysis shows that the organizations with high influence over the governance process reside at the national level and the adaptation governance process is influenced by elite-pluralism. We found that both top-down and bottom-up processes co-exist in different phases of adaptation governance (planning, implementation, and monitoring). Lastly, we conclude that a more equitable redistribution of power (roles and responsibilities) may diminish the negative implications of federal centralization in adaptation governance.

One of its possible consequences is the increase of extreme events: floods, droughts and storms, as reflected in the climate change documents of the 2030 Agenda. The main objective of this research is to determine whether this increase can be confirmed in the coastal area of Cadiz (Spain). To achieve that, wave measurement buoys installed in the gulf and bay have been identified and their extreme statistical distributions have been studied. The evolution of the values of the significant wave height and the peak period of wave storms has been analyzed during the last decade. For that, 20, 50, 225 and 475 years of return period have been considered. For deeper research and more conclusive data, numerical simulations of wave propagation in the zone have been performed using the CMS-Wave model, developed by the USACE Hydraulics and Coastal Laboratory. One of the main conclusions of this investigation is that an increase in the magnitude of storms on the coast of Cadiz cannot be confirmed. This statement has important effects on the design of new maritime structures and the validation of the design of maritime structures already in operation.

The strategy promotes forestation and higher bioethanol energy demand. This study aims to investigate the effects of the climate and land-use changes on water balance in 2037, the end of the National Strategy, for the Mun River Basin, NE Thailand. The simulated climate dataset used in this study was ensemble means from IPCC AR5 Global Circulation Models for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The land-use change was simulated using the Dyna-CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the water balance (considering evapotranspiration-ET, percolation-PERC, surface runoff-SURQ, and groundwater lateral flow-LATQ). The combined effects could increase monthly ET, whereas the climate change effect could outrun the land-use changes, resulting in increasing PERC. The sustainable development under the National Strategy (2018-2037) could be insignificantly affecting the water balance, whereas the "Bioethanol-Oriented" land-use scenario could increase SURQ and decline LATQ, which could intensify flooding. Soil-water conservation measures are recommended to mitigate the adverse effects of bioenergy.

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of both phenomena. The Black Sea region is of special interest to water resources because it is a closed basin with European Union and non-European Union countries. The sustainable management of the water resources requires the collaboration of all the countries of the Basin. In this study, the views of water management experts in the Black Sea region of six countries in regard to water scarcity, flooding, climate change impacts, and their interactions were collected and analyzed with an online web questionnaire. The participants of the questionnaire were from: Greece, Moldova, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine. The results of such a questionnaire are important because experts and stakeholders views will help implement socially acceptable water management plans. Based on the participants answers water scarcity was considered a serious problem in four of the countries. In contrast, all countries considered flooding a serious problem. Most participants considered that these problems will increase in the future and that measures need to be taken. These suggested measures included better water and forest management, improving equipment and infrastructure, utilizing new technologies and enhancing awareness.

J	McNeely, JA				McNeely, Jeffrey A.			Nature and COVID-19: The pandemic, the environment, and the way ahead	AMBIO			English	Article						Biodefense; Biodiversity; Climate change; Health; Wildlife trade; Zoonotic diseases		The COVID-19 pandemic has brought profound social, political, economic, and environmental challenges to the world. The virus may have emerged from wildlife reservoirs linked to environmental disruption, was transmitted to humans via the wildlife trade, and its spread was facilitated by economic globalization. The pandemic arrived at a time when wildfires, high temperatures, floods, and storms amplified human suffering. These challenges call for a powerful response to COVID-19 that addresses social and economic development, climate change, and biodiversity together, offering an opportunity to bring transformational change to the structure and functioning of the global economy. This biodefense can include a "One Health" approach in all relevant sectors; a greener approach to agriculture that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and leads to healthier diets; sustainable forms of energy; more effective international environmental agreements; post-COVID development that is equitable and sustainable; and nature-compatible international trade. Restoring and enhancing protected areas as part of devoting 50% of the planet's land to environmentally sound management that conserves biodiversity would also support adaptation to climate change and limit human contact with zoonotic pathogens. The essential links between human health and well-being, biodiversity, and climate change could inspire a new generation of innovators to provide green solutions to enable humans to live in a healthy balance with nature leading to a long-term resilient future.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System was used to simulate the complete hydrologic processes of the various dendritic watershed systems and USACEs' Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System hydraulic model was used for the two-dimensional unsteady flow flood calculations. Climate projections are based on recent global climate model simulations developed for the International Panel on Climate Change, Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5. Hydrographs for frequent (high-recurrence interval) storms were derived from 30-year historical daily precipitation data and decadal projections for both time frames and RCP scenarios. Since the climate projections for each scenario only represented ten years of data, 100-year or 500-year storms cannot be derived. Hence, this novel approach of identifying frequent storms is used as an indicator to compare across the various time frames and climate scenarios. Hydrographs were used to generate inundation maps and results are used to identify vulnerabilities and formulate adaptation strategies to flooding at 43 locations worldwide.

Furthermore, in recent years, there has been an increase in city extent and population densities. This study considers the metropolitan area of Pamplona (Spain) as a case study. The delta changes in precipitation quantiles in the Arga River catchment, obtained from 12 climate models, have been transformed into peak flow delta changes using the Real-time Interactive Basin Simulator (RIBS) model. Also, three percentiles of flood quantile delta changes are selected. Water depths and flood extents expected in future flood events have been obtained using the two-dimensional Iber hydrodynamic model. The Safer_DAMAGE algorithm has been used to assess flood losses in urban areas at the building scale. The results show that flood losses are expected to be smaller for low return periods and greater for high return periods.

Infrequent inspections, inadequate data on foundation depths, and the lack of consideration of hydrologic and climate parameters often result in un-certainties within current scour risk assessments. This paper presents an approach for assessing the risk progression of local scour in peak flow conditions that consider uncertainties associated with location, downscaling of climate predictions, and hydrologic, hydraulic and scour prediction models. A rational scour risk rating based on warning time to failure is introduced that can provide a useful addition to the existing bridge condition indexes. The case study on a set of railway bridges in Southeast England shows that climate change could accelerate the scour risk progression, even in the low-emission scenario. The approach and results form a vital basis for scour risk mitigation and climate adaptation planning.

It is based on fieldwork among seven low-lying coastal villages under threat from sea- level rise and where planned relocation has been implemented, initiated or anticipated. The paper highlights how residents of these villages make sense of different temporalities and timescale: climate impacts and adaptation are understood to disrupt personal and intergenerational histories of attachment to place; climatic and environmental changes such as sea-level rise, coastal erosion and flooding and relocation planning and implementation are central to contemporary everyday experience; and climate impacts and relocation extend into the future in uncertain ways, albeit informed by future-oriented scientific estimates and local experience and observation. This paper argues that these temporalities are experienced as 'thick time' in which the past, present and future of climate change and relocation are palpable in the everyday.

Climate change represents another challenge to this sector, albeit one that is not traditionally considered by water managers. In this sector in China water management is predominantly based on historic, seasonal and annual forecast data while multi-annual and (multi-)decadal data are seldom used. In this paper, we present the co-development of a climate service prototype designed to provide water managers with insights into the impacts of climate change on the Upper Yellow River region for the next century. The paper is an outcome from our project that encouraged water resource planners and water resource managers to utilise long-term climate information to understand the uncertainties and the challenges our changing climate is likely to have in the region. Using an interdisciplinary team and adopting a user-centred, co-production approach, a prototype web-based data visualisation tool was developed. The development of the prototype was based on a design specification constructed from the findings of detailed interviews that allowed it to be developed and tested under SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions that prevented the typical development process to be undertaken. The developed prototype presents climate information and communicates uncertainties regarding climate change in the remainder of the century through data sets that are typically used by the water sector in China in a simple, easy to understand style. Models that estimate river levels under different extraction scenarios and results about estimated river level and flow, and flood risk are also presented. The prototype was shown to be successful, as key messages relating to the impact of climate change and the challenges for water resource management could be effectively communicated through the tool interface. Practical implications: Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resourcing is complicated and multifaceted. There is a need for better data about what water there is and how it is moving around between and within catchments. Estimates of past, present and future climate variables along with historical measurements of river flow can be used to help visualise some of the uncertainties and changes that may happen in the next 50 years. In addition, there is a need to understand changing water demands and water resource management practices. Current water resource management practices are based on historical conditions and assumptions that are less likely to hold true in a more variable and warmer climate. Communicating how future changes will impact future water resourcing is critical to water resources in a changing climate (Belcher et al. 2018). This research outlines the construction of a tool to visualise the impacts of climate change on water availability in part of China that is typically water scarce, using models developed using the Soil Water Assessment Toolkit (SWAT). A model of the Upper Yellow River (UYR) was developed to demonstrate the impact of climate change on river levels in the catchment based on climate variables. The rainfall-runoff model was based on climate predictions from the CMIP5 assessment HadGEM3-GC3.05 climate model and incorporated information about	[Siu, Yim Ling; Taylor, Andrea; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Taylor, Andrea] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Ctr Decis Res, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Su, Buda] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Willis, Thomas; Turner, Andrew] Univ Leeds, Water Leeds Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, England; [Griffiths, Guy] Inst Environm Analyt, Reading RG6 6BX, England; [Rostron, John] Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England	University of Leeds; University of Leeds; China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Leeds; Met Office - UK	Siu, YL (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sustainabil Res Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, England.

J	Lim, JR				Lim, JungKyu Rhys			Why People Adopt Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction Behaviors: Integrated Model of Risk Communication and Results from Hurricanes, Floods, and Wildfires	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Social science; North America; Adaptation; Communications; decision making; Extreme events; Emergency preparedness	AMAZONS MECHANICAL TURK; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; INFORMATION-SEEKING; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; TORNADO PREPAREDNESS; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY; SELF-EFFICACY; FEAR APPEALS	With climate change, weather and climate disaster risks are increasing. At-risk individuals can take climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction behaviors to mitigate and prepare for disaster risks, reduce costs from damage, and save their lives. However, previous fragmented studies have not provided an integrated model to directly compare the factors and identify factors that are most influential in at-risk community members' behaviors. I present the Integrated Model of Risk Communication by consolidating major theories. This study uses structural equation modeling of quantitative surveys to simultaneously test the impacts of 15 factors on 15 adaptation behaviors for the two most common federally declared disasters (wildfires and hurricanes with floods) in three disaster-prone U.S. states (California, Florida, and Texas) (N = 3,468). Specifically, this study examines 15 behaviors including preparedness, nonstructural mitigation, structural mitigation, insurance purchase, and adaptation policy support. Social norms perceptions, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and resource constraints strongly affect behaviors. Response efficacy strongly affects policy support. Risk perception, knowledge, and climate change perception-commonly argued to be key drivers-are insignificant or weak. The models explain 55%-86% of the variance in adaptation behaviors. Results suggest that the focus of adaptation efforts may need to shift from risk perception and climate change perception to efficacy and social norms.

J	Leal, KB; Robaina, LED; De Lima, AD				Leal, Karine Bastos; de Souza Robaina, Luis Eduardo; De Lima, Andre de Souza			Coastal impacts of storm surges on a changing climate: a global bibliometric analysis	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Scientific production; Climate change; Storm surge; Coastal erosion; Coastal flooding; Sea-level rise	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SCIENCE	An increase in the global mean sea level is predicted during the twenty-first century, as a consequence of global average rising temperature projections. In addition, changes in the strength of atmospheric cyclonic storms may alter the development of storm surges, exacerbating the risks to coastal communities. Based on the fact that the interest and range of papers on this topic are growing, this study aims to present the status of the global scientific production on studies that have correlated climate change and the impact of storm surges on the coastal zone leading to erosion and flooding (inundation) via a bibliometric analysis. We analyzed 429 papers published in journals between January 1991 and February 2021 from the Scopus database. Through the VOSviewer and Bibliometrix R package, we describe the most relevant countries, affiliations, journals, authors, and keywords. Our results demonstrate that there has been an exponential growth in the research topic and that authors from the USA and the United Kingdom are the most prolific. Among the 1454 authors found, ten researchers published at least five papers on the topic and obtained at least 453 citations in the period. The most represented journals were the Journal of Coastal Research, Climatic Change, and Natural Hazards.

In order to explore whether and why abnormal correlation exits in its five sub-basins, the temporal changes between AED and AE were compared, and then the impacts of climate change and human activities on abnormal correlations were assessed using the sensitivity method of Penman equation and the decomposition method of Budyko equation. The results indicated: (1) Pan evaporation and potential evaporation (indicators of AED) decreased at rates of up to -0.04 and -0.06 mm d(-1) decade(-1), respectively. In contrast, the water budget-derived evaporation (an indicator of AE) increased at the rate of 0.09 mm d(-1) decade(-1) in the Fuhe River basin and remained stable in other basins. Abnormal correlations (nonpositive correlations) were observed. (2) Decreasing net radiation and wind speed were major climate factors resulting in simultaneous temporal decreases in AED and AE. In contrast, afforestation was a major human factor leading to an increase in annual AE of 78 mm, but had no effect on AED. Afforestation was the primary driving force of the abnormal correlation. These results could provide water-energy guidance for urban climate change mitigation and flood/drought disaster management.

These extreme phenomena lead to the rise of external and internal precursors in water reservoirs, and consequently affect the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of nitrogenous_DBPs (N-DBPs) under extreme conditions caused by climate change. For this reason, two scenarios were adapted: a) sea level rise leading to increase of water salinity and b) heavy rainfall incidents leading to flooding events. The target-compounds were haloacetonitriles (HANs), hal-oacetamides (HAcAms) and halonitromethane (TCNM). Chlorination and chloramination were employed as disinfection processes under different doses (5 and 10 mg/L) and contact times (24 and 72 h). The results showed enhancement on the formation of N-DBPs and changes in their profile. Sea level rise scenario led to elevated concentrations of brominated species (maximum concentration of dibromoacetonitrile 23 & mu;g/L and maximum concentration of bromoacetamide 57 & mu;g/L), while flooding events scenario led to extended formation of chlor-oacetamide and bromochloroacetonitrile up to 58 & mu;g/L and 40 & mu;g/L, respectively. At the same time, changes in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the samples were observed.

Climate change and its impacts on agriculture, especially grain production, is one of the major challenges for food security and sustainable development. From the perspective of natural flow, climate change directly affects plant growth via water circulation, such as droughts and floods. Although the covariation of surface temperature and CO2 concentration will to some extent benefit crop photosynthesis, grain production may fluctuate according to the grain market, which is also affected by its erratic provisioning. We then determine how climate change affects grain production and efficiency using an input distance function and technical inefficiency model. First, we discover a significant relationship between surface temperature and grain production, although this impact is marginal; the coefficient is 0.0037 in the estimated model. Second, we find that surface temperature influences grain production not only through its photosynthesis but also its production efficiency in major grain production areas. And grain production efficiency is in a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2010, the average efficiency in 2010 is 0.75 on the whole. Third, there is a large gap in grain production efficiency among counties in Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Henan provinces, according to a distribution map of that efficiency.

Different types of climate extremes drive soil microbial communities to alternative states, leading to a series of consequences for soil microbial ecosystems and related functions. An effective method is urgently needed for buffering microbial communities to tackle environmental disturbances. Here, we conducted a series of mesocosm experiments in which the organic (NOF) and chemical fertilizer (NCF) long-term-amended soil microbiotas were subjected to environmental disturbances that included drought, flooding, freeze-thaw cycles, and heat. We subsequently tracked the temporal dynamics of rare and abundant bacterial taxa in NOF and NCF treatment soils to assess the efficiencies of organic amendments in recovery of soil microbiome. Our results revealed that freeze-thaw cycles and drought treatments showed weaker effects on bacterial communities than flooding and heat. The turnover between rare and abundant taxa occurred in post-disturbance succession of flooding and heat treatments, indicating that new equilibria were tightly related to the rare taxa in both NCF and NOF treatment soils. The Bayesian fits of modeling for the microbiome recovery process revealed that the stability of abundant taxa in NOF was higher than that in NCF soil. In particular, the NOF treatment soil reduced the divergence from the initial bacterial community after weak perturbations occurred. Together, we demonstrated that long-term organic input is an effective strategy to enhance the thresholds for transition to alternative states via enhancing the stability of abundant bacterial species. These findings provide a basis for the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems in response to changing climates. IMPORTANCE Different climate extremes are expected to be a major threat to crop production, and the soil microbiome has been known to play a crucial role in agricultural ecosystems. In recent years, we have known that organic amendments are an effective method for optimizing the composition and functioning of the soil microbial community and maintaining the health of the soil ecosystem. However, the effects of organic fertilization on buffering bacterial communities against environmental disturbances and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We conducted a series of mesocosm experiments and showed that organic fertilizers had additional capacities in promoting the soil microbiome to withstand climate change effects. Our study provides both mechanistic insights as well as a direct guide for the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems in response to climate change.

Rice farmers have also responded to perceived climate risks with strategies believed to be climate-smart. Farmers' perception of climate risks is an important first step of determining any action to be taken to counteract the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Studies on the link between perceived climate risks and farmers' response strategies are increasing. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of rice farmers' perception of climate events. The paper therefore examined climate change perception and uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production in Ebonyi State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data from 347 rice farmers in an important rice-producing area in Nigeria. Principal component analysis, multivariate probit regression model and descriptive statistics were adopted for data analysis. Perceived climate events include increased rainfall intensity, prolonged dry seasons, frequent floods, rising temperature, severe windstorms, unpredictable rainfall pattern and distribution, late onset rain, and early cessation of rain. Farmers' socioeconomic, farm and institutional characteristics influenced their perception of climate change. Additionally, rice farmers used a variety of climate-smart practices and technologies to respond to the perceived climate events. Such climate-smart practices include planting improved rice varieties, insurance, planting different crops, livelihood diversification, soil and water conservation techniques, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, reliance on climate information and forecasts, planting on the nursery, appropriate application of fertilizer and efficient and effective use of pesticides. These climate-smart agricultural measures were further delineated into five broad packages using principal component analysis. These packages include crop and land management practices, climate-based services and irrigation, livelihood diversification and soil fertility management, efficient and effective use of pesticide and planting on the nursery. High fertilizer costs, lack of access to inputs, insufficient land, insufficient capital, pests and diseases, floods, scorching sun, high labour cost, insufficient climate information, and poor extension services were the barriers to uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production. Rice farmers should be supported to implement climate-smart agriculture in rice production in order to achieve the objectives of increased rice productivity and income, food security, climate resilience and mitigation.

Besides, over the past decades, important land cover changes have occurred, such as reforestation, agricultural intensification, urban expansion and the construction of many reservoirs. Here we study the impacts of these changes in a typical large Mediterranean catchment and focus on relevant ecosystem services, i.e. primary production, water supply, food production, water regulation, flood and erosion control, and cultural ecosystem services. We applied a hydrological model, coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model, for the period 1971-2010 to the entire catchment, and for an extended period (1952-2018), with more pronounced land use changes, to one of its subcatchments that plays a crucial role for regional drinking water provision. Climate change in the evaluated period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature. Land use changes included an increase in natural vegetation in the headwaters, agricultural intensification and reservoir construction in the central part, and urban expansion in the downstream part of the catchment. The positive impacts on ecosystem services were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion, sediment yield, sediment concentration and flood discharge, which are mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction. The negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage, for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments. While grey infrastructures like reservoir construction showed important positive impacts on some ecosystem services, such as water regulation and flood control, they also potentially induce negative impacts, such as an increase of water demand and ecological integrity. We argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructures and nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and sustainable land management, which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services, but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructures. This supports the need for integrated land-use management to sustainably protect ecosystem services, considering the expected climate change impacts on Mediterranean environments and societies.

Plant science can play an important role in developing crops with enhanced resilience to harsh conditions (e.g. heat, drought, salt stress, flooding, disease outbreaks) and engineering efficient carbon-capturing and carbon-sequestering plants. Here, we present examples of research being conducted in these areas and discuss challenges and open questions as a call to action for the plant science community.

We specifically consider the impacts on populations vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition due to lower income, lower access to nutritious food, or social discrimination. The paper defines climate-related "severe risk" in the context of food security and nutrition, using a combination of criteria, including the magnitude and likelihood of adverse consequences, the timing of the risk and the ability to reduce the risk. Severe climate change risks to food security and nutrition are those which result, with high likelihood, in pervasive and persistent food insecurity and malnutrition for millions of people, have the potential for cascading effects beyond the food systems, and against which we have limited ability to prevent or fully respond. The paper uses internationally agreed definitions of risks to food security and nutrition to describe the magnitude of adverse consequences. Moreover, the paper assesses the conditions under which climate change -induced risks to food security and nutrition could become severe based on findings in the literature using different climate change scenarios and shared socioeconomic pathways. Finally, the paper proposes adaptation options, including institutional management and governance actions, that could be taken now to prevent or reduce the severe climate risks to future human food security and nutrition.

To cushion themselves against climate change, farmers need to invest in appropriate adaptation measures. This study investigates and reviews adaptation measures in the crop sector of 21 African countries. The main source of data are National Communications under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To obtain the latest data and information the Second and Third National Communications were retrieved. Using a grounded theory approach, 33 categories of adaptation measures emerged, which were later collapsed into six thematic adaptation areas. Then an in-depth analysis of relevant documents and a systematic literature review were conducted. From the adaptation categories, conservation agriculture; water, irrigation and flood management; crop diversification; inputs and subsidies; disease and pest management; and weather-based index insurance emerged. The findings show that African governments have identified many adaptation measures and have claimed some success. However, it was evident that some limiting factors remain in building a climate-resilient crop sector. The research concludes that although governments claim success in adaptation measures that have been put in place, additional studies should be conducted to verify and confirm the success of such adaptation approaches being applied.

In addition, there has also been a spread of the urbanised area, which has led to an increase in the flood risk in urban areas (due to a greater runoff and the occupation of flood hazard areas) and drought events due to an increase in the water demand. In light of these new scenarios, the Mediterranean cities should design adaptation systems based on rainwater harvesting within the framework of a circular economy. This study analyses the integration of rainwater in flood and water demand management in the city of Alicante (Southern Spain). In recent years, this city has developed infrastructures in order to use these resources. To do this, different databases have been analysed (rainfall and volume of water collected in the green infrastructure systems). The results reveal that stormwater has become highly important in urban water management in Alicante as the city is now using a resource that previously went to waste and created problems (flooding and pollution). By way of conclusion, it is worth mentioning that the incorporation of rainwater for urban use in Alicante has reduced the pressure on traditional resources in satisfying water demand and has also acted as a measure for adapting to climate change.

However, the effects of climate change are obscured in the observed impact data series due to the rapid evolution of the social and economic circumstances in which the events occurred. The HANZE v2.0 (Historical Analysis of Natural HaZards in Europe) dataset presented in this study quantifies the evolution of key socioeconomic drivers in Europe since 1870, namely land use, population, economic activity and assets. It consists of algorithms to reallocate baseline (2011) land use and population for any given year based on a large collection of historical subnational- and national-level statistics, and then disaggregate data on production and tangible assets by economic sector into a high-resolution grid. Raster datasets generated by the model enable reconstructing exposure within the footprint of any extreme event both at the time of occurrence and anytime between 1870 and 2020. This allows the separation of the effects of climate change from the effects of exposure change.

Monitoring temporal changes in coastal mangroves to understand the impacts of climate change: Red Sea, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Red Sea; Conservation; Climate change; Mangrove; Human threats; Satellite Imagery	MARINE PLANTS; FORESTS; PACIFIC	This paper focuses on the current state of mangroves in Egypt, analyses how climate change is affecting mangrove forests and suggests a conservation strategy to safeguard this valuable maritime resource. Mangroves in Egypt are primarily found in regions around the Red Sea, making them popular for ecotourism across the globe. A crucial breeding and feeding ground for many commercial fishery species, mangroves are a maritime habitat that is both economically and environmentally significant and a variety of living things call them home. Mangroves are one of the most threatened tropical and subtropical ecoregions in the world. These threats come from both natural and human sources, including oil spills, human waste runoff, herbicide use, and coastal development, all of which have the potential to harm the environment. Mangrove habitats are immediately impacted by salinity changes and rising sea levels brought on by climate change. This is unfortunate as mangroves are one of the most important global carbon sinks, and their loss due to climate change may accelerate sea level rise and ocean acidification, which will cause the extinction of numerous commercial fish species. A conservation strategy should be implemented to safeguard the mangroves around the Egyptian Red Sea by using mitigation techniques, creating marine protected zones near the mangroves, and consulting the owners of the mangrove stalks. Analysis of multi-temporal satellite imagery is one of the most significant methods to assist decision-makers and environmental planners in obtaining high-precision information about environmental and climatic changes. Analysis of satellite imagery is a valuable way to detect, monitor, assess and map the environmental, human, and natural activities that are threatening the growth of the mangrove forest ecosystem. Change detection analyses using satellite imagery were conducted to evaluate the effects of rapid coastal sustainable development, including human urban and tourism activities; the decline and destruction of large areas of the mangrove forest for animal feeding along camel trade roads; and the threat of natural impacts such as flash flooding, coastal and soil erosion or human impacts such as established desalination plants and other human activities along the coastal zone of the Egyptian Red Sea.

Evaluation of climate change resilience for Boston's rail rapid transit network	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Engineering resilience; Critical infrastructure; Climate change; Network model; Coastal flood risk	TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; METRICS; EQUITY; RISK	Sea level rise (SLR) poses increasing flood risks to coastal cities and infrastructure. We propose a general framework of engineering resilience for infrastructure systems in the context of climate change and illustrate its application for the assessment of SLR impacts on the rail rapid transit network in Boston. Within this framework, projected coastal flood events are treated as exogenous exposure events, which interact with both physical and topological endogenous network characteristics. We consider contextual aspects of resilience by assigning relative importance to links based on passenger flows. Resilience is computed assuming a linear recovery model, neglecting recovery strategies. Using a reference 1-100 year coastal flood event we show decreasing resilience of the rail transit network as projected SLR increases. The proposed framework can be readily extended to consider more sophisticated performance models, recovery strategies, other perturbation events, and additional contextual factors, such as equity considerations.

Content analysis and coastal adaptation principles allowed us to evaluate coordinated planning effort at county and state levels to derive a horizontal or vertical coordination index which was then used to evaluate if synergies generated among plans were correlated with climate risk mitigation and enhanced adaptation to climate change. Further, we incorporated evaluation results of varied community resilience characteristics and coordinated planning effort metrics in the context of climate change. Empirical results suggest that the extent of coordinated planning effort at the county and state levels is closely associated with coastal community resilience and climate change adaptation.

Global conversations and scholarly debates have explored ways people adapt to the impacts of climate change including through migration and relocation. This study uses Lagos, Nigeria as a case study to examine the relationship between flooding events, migration intentions as a preferred adaptation, and the destination choices for affected residents. The study draws on a mixed-methods approach which involved a survey of 352 residents and semi-structured interviews with 21 residents. We use a capability approach to analyze mobility decisions following major or repetitive flood events. We found that the majority of affected residents are willing to migrate but the ability to do so is constrained by economic, social, and political factors leading to involuntary immobility. Furthermore, intra-city relocation is preferred to migration to other states in Nigeria or internationally. These findings challenge popular Global South-North migration narratives. Indeed, some residents welcome government-supported relocation plans but others remain skeptical due to lack of trust. Community-based relocation may therefore be preferred by some Lagosians. Overall, this study contributes a nuanced understanding of mobility intentions in response to climate-induced flooding in one of the world's largest coastal cities.

Farmers' Agreement to Apply and Willingness to Pay for Climate-Smart Agricultural Technologies at the Farm Level	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Farmer resilience; Farmers subsidy; Flood management	CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; ADOPTION; ADAPTATION	Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) technologies are introduced to increase agricultural productivity and improve farmers' adaptation to climate change. Several factors influence the extent to which farmers in a particular location adopt CSA technologies. Due to the importance of financial issues, this study aimed to analyze farmers' agreement to apply and pay for these technologies in Iran. Accordingly, the study population was farmers at Aq Qala County in the north of Iran (N= 5,447). The sample size was estimated using the Bartlett Table (n= 119), and participants were selected through a simple random sampling method. The list of appropriate CSA technologies was prepared using a relevant article and adjusted to the local condition by the agricultural experts' comments in the research area. Results indicated that farmers' agreement is mainly higher than their willingness to pay for CSA technology. Specifically, they prefer to pay for technologies with low cost and short-term benefits (e g , minimum tillage, cover crops method, concentrate feeding for livestock, and crop insurance). Results of this study have practical implications for agricultural agencies in climate change adaptation planning at local level in that farmers should be trained to use low cost practices when they apply CSA practices. Moreover, allocating subsidies to some CSA technologies could be another suggestion to improve climate change management in Iran.

Study focus: The study reported here investigates (i) climate change impacts on flood risk in the region, and (ii) uncertainty related to hydrological modelling, downscaling techniques and climate projections. The climate projections used in the study were derived from five GCMs, downscaled either dynamically with RCMs or with the statistical downscaling model XDS. The resulting climate change scenarios were applied to drive the eco-hydrological model SWIM, which was calibrated and validated for the catchments in advance using observed climate and hydrological data. The changes in the 30-year flood hazards and 98 and 95 percentiles of discharge were evaluated for the far future period (2071-2100) in comparison with the reference period (1981-2010). New hydrological insights for the region: The majority of model outputs under RCP 4.5 show a small to strong increase of the 30-year flood level in the Tisza ranging from 4.5% to 62%, and moderate increase in the Prut ranging from 11% to 22%. The impact results under RCP 8.5 are more uncertain with changes in both directions due to high uncertainties in GCM-RCM climate projections, downscaling methods and the low density of available climate stations.

A semi-quantitative, indicator-based risk assessment of heat stress was carried out on the 23 functional areas of the city sectorized by the Plan, including modeling and spatial analysis exercises. A data model of 18 indicators was built to characterize vulnerability. A thermal stress map was developed using the URbCLim model and a heat index was then calculated using Copernicus hourly data (air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) for the period of January 2008-December 2017 at a spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m. General recommendations at the city level as well as guidelines for development planning in the functional areas at risk are provided, with specifications for the deployment of nature-based solutions as adaptation measures. From a planning perspective, the study positively informs the General Urban Development Plan, the City Green and Biodiversity Plan, and contributes to City Urban Strategy 2030 and City Missions 2030 for climate adaptation and neutrality. Applying the same approach to other climate change-related hazards (i.e., water scarcity, pluvial flooding, sea level rise) will allow better informed decisions towards resilient urban planning.

However, this is rarely the case in developing countries where there is both lack of in-situ data collection and forecasting tools. Here, we consider the case of the Kapuas River delta (KRD), a data-scarce delta on the west coast of Borneo Island, Indonesia. We assessed future flood risk under three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). We combined the multiple linear regression and the GIS-based bathtub inundation models to assess the future flood risk. The former model was implemented to model the river's water-level dynamics in the KRD, particularly in Pontianak, under the influence of rainfall changes, surface wind changes, and sea-level rise. The later model created flood maps with inundated areas under a 100-year flood scenario, representing Pontianak's current and future flood extent. We found that about 6.4%-11.9% more buildings and about 6.8%-12.7% more roads will be impacted by a 100-year flood in 2100. Our assessment guides the local water manager in preparing adequate flood mitigation strategies.

The Mediterranean region is a climate-change hotspot, where traditional agricultural systems, like olive groves, are particularly challenged. Both the traditional and intensive systems of olive culture coexist in the Mediterranean. Both systems differ in their demands for water and agrochemicals, but nowadays, the global inputs of agrochemicals and irrigation have increased to achieve high productivity and profitability. Finding sustainable alternatives to maintain high productivity under the ongoing climate change is urgent to meet the EU-Farm to Fork strategy and climate neutrality. Candidate eco-friendly alternatives include biostimulants. These are substances or microorganisms, that activate signaling cascades and metabolic processes, increasing plant yield, quality, and tolerance to stressors. These benefits include a better growth, nutritional status and water availability, leading to a decreased demand for irrigation and agrochemicals. In this review, we aim to present different types of biostimulants (e.g., seaweed, protein hydrolysates, humic substances, microorganisms and nanomaterials), their mode of action and benefits in agriculture. We also explore the current state-of-the-art regarding the use of biostimulants in olive culture, and their potential benefits to increase tolerance to (a)biotic challenges.

In some countries a cause of low demand for flood insurance is the crowding out of private insurance uptake due to the anticipation of government compensation for uninsured damage, a phenomenon known as charity hazard. This study applies a partial equilibrium model of flood insurance markets to explore the extent of charity hazard and the insurance protection gap for EU-countries until 2050. For this analysis, we apply an expected utility framework with insurance purchase decision functions that capture the probability, ambiguity and extent of government compensation. By accounting for country-level insurance systems and government compensation types, as well as regional flood risk, we aim to assess how charity hazard develops under different conditions. The extent of charity hazard decreases with uncertainty of government compensation, as well as with higher flood risk. Considering current and future conditions, the highest impact of charity hazard is observed in regions of Germany and Italy. The projected insurance protection gap is highest in Germany, followed by Spain, Poland and Italy, and is expected to grow towards 2050.	[Tesselaar, Max; Botzen, W. J.

The projections are taken into account by enhancing the present cyclone wind intensity by 7% and 11% based on the IPCC fifth assessment report to study its impact on extreme water elevations and coastal flooding. The coupled ADCIRC + SWAN model is used in this study to map the maximum water elevations resulting from storm surges, astronomical tides, and wind-waves by utilizing the most probabilistic cyclone tracks generated for this region. Results from the study signifies that extreme water elevations ranging between 9.0 and 9.5 m are evident in the Gulf of Khambhat and Kutch under no-climate change scenario, while it enhances to a maximum of 10.0-11.0 m under climate change projections. Maximum extent of coastal inundation is found in the low-lying regions of Great and Little Rann of Kutch, Mumbai, and high-tide mudflats of Bhavnagar. It is notable that climate projections have maximum impact on inundation height, while it is marginal in terms of risk associated with the additional inundation extent.	[Poulose, Jismy; Rao, A.

South Pacific Island countries (SPICs) are affected and face a dire challenge to survival. Sea level rise is reducing the already limited land for human and animal habitation. Tropical cyclones and droughts are having devastating effects on the lives of humans and animals. Tropical cyclone Winston, for example, destroyed infrastructure for humans and animals in some parts of Fiji, and infectious diseases are spreading to regions where they are not commonly seen following cyclones and floods. Likewise, climate change is making droughts worse. Droughts are destroying crops and pasturelands and making freshwater unavailable for human and animal populations in the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. There is an urgent need to ascertain the best approaches to tackle the events, which are already happening. Short-term changes can be managed at local levels through public awareness campaigns, understanding the weather patterns to prepare for disasters, reclaiming land, improving livestock breeds, introducing zoos and wildlife sanctuaries and inventing economically feasible technologies to harvest water. Long-term solutions depend on the implementation of international agreements, international aid and collective effort.

J	Jeffers, J				Jeffers, James			Barriers to transformation towards participatory adaptation decision-making: Lessons from the Cork flood defences dispute	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						adaptation; barriers; transformation; floods; hazards; climate; governance; participation	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; OVERCOMING BARRIERS; PLACE ATTACHMENT; KNOWLEDGE	This paper analyses the causes and consequences of public participation failures in flood hazards management and the important lessons they offer for climate change adaptation. Despite the potential for participatory adaptation decision-making, scholarship on adaptation has remained largely separate from the literature on participatory environmental governance. This paper brings these literatures into conversation by applying the concept of transformation to both adaptation outcomes and adaptation decision-making. Through an examination of a disputed flood relief scheme in Cork, Ireland this paper develops three main arguments. (1) It demonstrates the need for analytical approaches which recognise that what constitutes transformative adaptation will vary depending on the definitions of transformation that are used, the contexts in which these definitions are applied, and the perspectives of local stakeholders. (2) It argues that by producing an intractable conflict and damaging the reputation of the organisations responsible for hazards management, public participation failures create formidable new barriers to transformative adaptation outcomes. (3) It concludes that incremental changes to the decision-making process will prove insufficient to overcome these barriers. In order to facilitate more effective public participation in hazards management and climate change adaptation, much wider change in hazards management policy and resourcing will be required.

The quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge, especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities. In this study, the decomposition method based on Budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in Huifa River basin by defining prechange period (1953-1974) and postchange period (1975-2005). The results are further verified by the monthly abcd model. Both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale, with 68% of the change contributed by direct human activities. At the seasonal scale, the direct human-induced declines in streamflow account for 67% and 39% of the total changes for energy-limited and water-limited seasons, respectively; whereas, the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation. In addition, the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy-limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season.

Flooding causes millions of peoples displacement and raises poverty in flood affected low income communities particularly reside in most hazards prone developing countries like Pakistan. Objective of this study is to examine the association in climate change vulnerability and multidimensional poverty in two districts flood prone rural communities of Punjab, Pakistan. In this research work collected data of 480 households was used where livelihood and climate change vulnerability indices were applied for empirical estimation of climate vulnerability levels. Poverty levels were estimated through the application of multidimensional poverty index based on the initiatives of human development, Oxford poverty and United Nation Development Program. Estimates indicated almost half population of research area collapse lower than the threshold of multidimensional poverty. Rajanpur district was estimated higher intensity of poverty and higher number of population involved multidimensional poverty rather than Muzaffargarh. Moreover, Rajanpur district considered much deprived in the dimensions of poverty like living standard, health and education. Regarding climate change vulnerability Muzaffargarh lagged at the back in livelihood strategies dimensions, food, socio-demographic profile and social networks while Rajanpur considered much vulnerable in the health, financial assets and natural assets dimensions. In the overall conclusions related to flood disasters Rajanpur district more vulnerable than Muzaffargarh and study estimated significant and positive association in climate change vulnerability indices and multidimensional poverty index. Inadequate formal schooling and nonappearance of climate change vulnerability assessment in the study area more possibility of raises higher severity of multidimensional poverty. Policy concerned relevant authorities need to apply the analysis of poverty assessment about vulnerability of climate change. Formal schooling must provided to inhabited population to raising capabilities of decision-making, productivity, job opportunities, information access and level of awareness. Moreover, flood risk mitigation policy measures need to applied through flood defense and hotspots identification where poverty and flood risks occurs.

Methods We obtained the texts of countries'annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low-and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor. Conclusion Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health. Climate change is taking an increasing toll on people's health. The increase in heatwaves, drought, floods and other climate hazards is increasing the risk of climate-related illness and death as well as reversing gains made in reducing food insecurity and global hunger.1,2 Air pollution, primarily driven by fossil fuel emissions, is the major environmental risk factor for premature death and has impacts on child health and survival.3-5 Highlighting these human impacts is seen as a way of accelerating climate action,	[Jin, Huajie; Pennington, Mark] Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England; [Wang, Haiyin] Shanghai Hlth Dev Res Ctr, Hlth Technol Assessment Res Dept, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiao] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Antwerp, Belgium; [Zheng, Weiwei] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ye, Shanke] Shanghai Publ Hlth Clin Ctr, Dept Infect Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiahui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia	University of London; King's College London; University of Antwerp; Fudan University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Western Australia	Jin, HJ (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England.	huajie.jin@kcl.ac.uk	Li, Xiao/AAV-3113-2020; Shi, Yaolin/JXN-8322-2024	Li, Xiao/0000-0002-1918-1791; 	Fourth Round of the Shanghai Three-year Action Plan on Public Health Discipline and Talent Program: Evidence-based Public Health and Health Economics [15GWZK0901]	Fourth Round of the Shanghai Three-year Action Plan on Public Health Discipline and Talent Program: Evidence-based Public Health and Health Economics	We received no funding for this research.

We used the ethnographic approach to describe the case studies and carried out thematic analysis to disentangle the factors that explain such responses. The first case was that of a rural community from Ranogha Island in the Western Province that was hit by the Tsunami of April 2007; the second was of a community settled in an informal development on a flood-prone area in peri-urban Honiara that was hit by a flash flood in April 2014. Drawing from the villagers' experiences, we found that aid and support from family and community, referred to by the respondents as the "wantok" system, was key to recovering from the disasters. Many respondents identified climate change as one leading factor that explained such catastrophic events. The social cooperation system, the government's role in responding to catastrophes and household net worth were identified among the main components of household responses. These constitute an effective engine to build palliative and preventive responses against catastrophic events and climate change risks. In spite of the extreme poverty observed, and the lack of government assistance, we conclude that amenities obtained from the community (through the wantok system) and household net worth (including the availability of common pool resources) enabled them to cope with the catastrophes. These factors are critical for long-term adaptation to EEEs and climate change risks. The community responses analysed with thematic analysis showed to be consistent with the conceptualization led by a farm-household model, and the household net worth as a source of income appears to be the correct measure of wealth instead the level of income in these less monetarised communities. Learning from how these communities and households responded to such EEEs provides evidence on how other communities could successfully adapt to increasing climate change risks.

In mountainous areas, water shortages are becoming increasingly problematic as a result of the impacts of climate change and measures to promote water conservation in mountainous areas are more challenging. In an attempt to optimize the environmental advantages of water conservation strategies, it is critical to understand the factors that influence household water consumption decisions. This study aims to focus on assessing the adoption behavior of water conservation among 778 households in 8 mountainous provinces of Vietnam. In this study, the multivariate probit model (MPV) is used to examine the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic variables and five household water-use activities. The current study looked at the factors that influence the adoption of five different water conservation measures by households and variables related to the cognition of climate change, household characteristics and innate human qualities. The findings of this study reveal positive correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic variables and five household water-use activities. The results suggest that all intrinsic factors had a positive effect on the likelihood of implementing all five water-conserving strategies. However, extrinsic factors such as access to microcredit, rain, and cooperation are all factors that have a detrimental impact on water conservation measures. Based on the outcomes of the MPV model, we may assert that awareness of the effects of climate change is a contributing factor in explaining the adoption of water preservation strategies. The study areas and other similar regions in the country could benefit from a better understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of households to build relevant interventions for water conservation. Future studies are needed to determine how psychological mechanisms of behavior change and how perception of water scarcity affects intention of water usage.

The sediment-laden nature of the Yellow River gave rise to a super-elevated channel belt, which is prone to failure particularly in the summer months when excessive precipitation occurs, resulting in cataclysmic floods traditionally regarded as "China's Sorrow." Therefore, a deeper understanding of levee breach frequency in this area is especially important for the assessment of socio-economic risk of levee breaches associated with future climate changes. To better understand the nature, evolution, and driving mechanisms of levee breaches on the lower Yellow River, it is necessary to place the instrumental data within a longer time framework. Here, we retrieve past information about levee breaches on the lower Yellow River since AD 11 from various documentary sources such as official histories of China. We evaluated each line of descriptions and narratives about the location, timing, and nature of each event in these documents, ending up with a detailed timeline of levee breaches on the lower Yellow River during the last 2000 years on an annual time scale. Our results reveal remarkable variations in the frequency of levee breaches superimposed on a long-term increasing trend. In addition to climate changes, the iterative embankment-siltation-breaching process caused a feedback: more breaches result in much more channel siltation, which in turn leads to even more breaches. The enhanced farming in the Loess Plateau played a pivotal role in the formation and operation of this positive feedback. Our findings may not only help improve the assessment of socio-economic risk of levee breaches associated with future climate changes, but also provide consulting information for hydraulic engineering and infrastructural designs in the lower Yellow river area.

Coastal regions in eastern and southern China may experience especially negative effects because of the frequent occurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs). This study presented a hazard assessment framework for TCs-induced flash floods under dimate change scenarios and assessed future inundations in Hadahe River basin, which is in northeastern China. From 1965 to 2014, there were twenty-four TCs ranging from severe tropical storm to super typhoon over Hadahe River basin in twenty years. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are too coarse to depict the impact of TCs on extreme precipitation; therefore, hourly precipitation data from two gauges and the tracks of TCs were used to assess the impact of TCs. An extreme precipitation event on 3-4 August 2012 and the same 600-year future probabilistic extreme rainfall were utilized to investigate the impact of climate change. Daily precipitation data from eight climate models from the NEX-GDDP dataset during 1965-2005 and 2050-2099 represented historical and future simulation conditions, respectively. The hydrologic model HEC-HMS was integrated with the hydraulic model FLO-2D to simulate discharges and inundations of past and future TCs episodes. The results showed that flooded area is projected to increase by 6.6% and 7.8% for inundation depth between 1.0 and 3.0 m under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. For inundation depth over 3.0 m, flooded area is projected to increase by 17.6% and 22.0%. Relative change of flash flood extent increases as inundation depth increases, indicating that climate change is likely to increase the risk of flash floods. Additional adaptation measures are needed to make the Hadahe River basin and other similar coastal basins more resilient. The results also indicated that considering the impact of TCs produces a more reliable assessment of future flash floods in coastal regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Adaptive Managed Retreat Approach to Address Shoreline Erosion at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION			English	Article						climate change; green infrastructure; Gopherus polyphemus; Peromyscus polionotus; dune restoration	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL	Climate change will greatly impact infrastructure and natural resources in low-lying coastal zones. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) encompasses 57,000 hectares on a barrier island that is at high risk of erosion and flooding resulting from natural processes and climate change. In 2010 and 2013/2014, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) implemented an adaptive management strategy to address the impact of increasing erosion on KSC. Two dunes totaling 1.7 kilometers in length were created to allow the shoreline to move landward slowly (i.e., managed retreat). The primary reason for building the dunes was to protect valuable national assets, but it was also anticipated that the dunes would provide habitat for wildlife. Post-construction monitoring efforts focused on vegetation and two protected species, Gopherus polyphemus (gopher tortoises) and Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris (southeastern beach mice). After five years of data collection, we found that desired species of vegetation proliferated and non-native species decreased over time. Numbers of G. polyphemus and their burrows increased steadily. P. polionotus niveiventris began using the dunes soon after they were planted and remained resident, based on trapping and radiotracking information. The created dunes have subsequently withstood two hurricanes and exhibited much less damage than the adjacent natural dunes. The use of green infrastructure appears to be effective for the simultaneous protection of NASA assets and conservation of important wildlife habitat. This adaptive management strategy using a managed retreat approach is a positive step toward addressing the uncertainty and variability of conditions associated with climate change and sea level rise.

The findings indicate that the timing of heavy storms (from 5-min to 24-h duration events in Ontario, Canada) is indicating that they are now predominantly occurring earlier within the calendar year. An example of the situation is that within the period from 1960 to 2017, the mean occurrence times of heavy storms have advanced by 44 days, with maximum and minimum time advances of 86 and 21 days, respectively. Trend analysis, including the Mann-Kendall test, linear regression, and Sen's slope method, all show that the times of heavy storms have advanced to earlier times within the calendar year. These earlier times of heavy storms will influence the natural and anthropogenic activities such as crop planning, drought management, and groundwater replenishment. This research provides new evidence and dimensions regarding the understanding of climate change, particularly related to the timing of heavy storms and various adaptation strategies (e.g., flood prevention and soil conservation).

This has been demonstrated a number of times, most recently by hurricanes such as Harvey and Maria, as well as Sandy and Katrina. The need to protect these infrastructures with robust protection mechanisms is critical for our continued existence along the world's coastlines. Planning these protections is non-trivial given the rare-event nature of strong storms and climate change manifested through sea level rise. This article proposes a framework for a methodology that combines multiple computational models, stakeholder interviews, and optimization to find an optimal protective strategy over time for critical coastal infrastructure while being constrained by budgetary considerations.

J	Li, MK; McGrath, H; Stefanakis, E				Li, Mingke; McGrath, Heather; Stefanakis, Emmanuel			Multi-Scale Flood Mapping under Climate Change Scenarios in Hexagonal Discrete Global Grids	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						flood modeling; Discrete Global Grid Systems; climate change; multi-resolution; machine learning	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PRIORITY-FLOOD; MODELS; SYSTEM	Among the most prevalent natural hazards, flooding has been threatening human lives and properties. Robust flood simulation is required for effective response and prevention. Machine learning is widely used in flood modeling due to its high performance and scalability. Nonetheless, data pre-processing of heterogeneous sources can be cumbersome, and traditional data processing and modeling have been limited to a single resolution. This study employed an Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area Aperture 3 Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid System (ISEA3H DGGS) as a scalable, standard spatial framework for computation, integration, and analysis of multi-source geospatial data. We managed to incorporate external machine learning algorithms with a DGGS-based data framework, and project future flood risks under multiple climate change scenarios for southern New Brunswick, Canada. A total of 32 explanatory factors including topographical, hydrological, geomorphic, meteorological, and anthropogenic were investigated. Results showed that low elevation and proximity to permanent waterbodies were primary factors of flooding events, and rising spring temperatures can increase flood risk. Flooding extent was predicted to occupy 135-203% of the 2019 flood area, one of the most recent major flooding events, by the year 2100. Our results assisted in understanding the potential impact of climate change on flood risk, and indicated the feasibility of DGGS as the standard data fabric for heterogeneous data integration and incorporated in multi-scale data mining.

This area also has had the highest frequency of disaster events within the province over the past ten years, where climate-related hazard was dominant. Therefore, it is necessary to receive public support for climate policies within the region. From this point of view, this paper aims to explore the local evidence of climate change, anthropogenic pressure which worsens climate hazards, and the linkage with local policies. The primary data source was a climate data set of observations from 1976- 2021, land use change information from 1990-2020, historical climate-related hazards, and related current policy documents. We found that the region's air temperature has continuously increased over 45 years with the positive standardized precipitation index (SPI) being dominant. Meanwhile the wind speed was tended to decrease since 2015 with the highest extreme record occurred in February 2021. Moreover, climate-related threats occurred more than 70 times in Bintan from 2011 to 2021 where forest fire and flood were tended to worsen. Another anthropogenic source, such as land use change, also puts significant pressure on the part where the open land has increased by 187%, and vegetation area has decreased by 51.1%. This condition creates these small islands vulnerable to climate change, especially climate-related hazards. However, in the regional development plan document 2021-2026, climate change adaptation is not one of the local priority issues, but their concern about disaster mitigation is quite severe. The local authorities work on hard and soft infrastructure to implement disaster risk reduction but less for ecosystem-based solution. However, promoting adaptation efforts in the local policy document is still necessary for sustainable development at the local level.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mean and variability of annual and seasonal rainfall in Pakistan are changing due to anthropogenic climate change. With the use of stationary and nonstationary frequency analysis techniques, this study set out to assess the impacts of nonstationarity in Southern Punjab, Pakistan, over the historical period of 1970-2015 and the future periods of 2020-2060 and 2060-2100. Four frequency distributions, namely Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Gumbel, normal, and lognormal, were used. The findings of the nonstationarity impact across Southern Punjab showed different kinds of impacts, such as an increase or reduction in the return level of extreme precipitation. In comparison to other distributions, GEV provided the finest fit. In Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Multan, Rahim Yar Khan and DG. Khan, the annual nonstationarity impacts for the 100-year return level were increased up to 15.2%, 8.7%, 58.3%, 18.7%, and 20%, respectively. Moreover, extreme precipitation was found to be increasing during the historical and projected periods, which may increase floods, while less water availability appeared at a seasonal scale (summer) during 2061-2100. The increased nonstationarity effects emphasized adapting these nonstationarities induced by climate change into the design of water resource structures.

However, the sustainability of farm livelihoods is under threat, due to the impacts of climate change and environmental pressure, including shifting hydrological regimes, droughts, water pollution, land subsidence and riverbank erosion. This study evaluated the livelihood sustainability and vulnerability of triple rice farmers on the floodplains of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD). We focused on the perceptions of rice farmers, based on a survey of 300 farmers. Increasing temperatures, drought, water pollution and sediment shortages were the four factors considered by farmers to have the most impact on their agricultural livelihoods. We analyzed farmers' capacity to sustain their livelihoods and adapt to the changing environment. Results show relatively low vulnerability of rice farmers overall, though many of those surveyed reported very low incomes from rice production. Factors of most concern to farmers were rising temperatures and more frequent droughts. Farmers were already taking steps to adapt, for example, increasing production inputs and investing more labor time, as well as switching production methods. Yet, our findings suggest that policymakers and scientists have a role to play in developing more sustainable adaptation paths. The research clarifies the livelihood vulnerability of triple rice farmers on the VMD floodplains, while more generally contributing to the body of literature on farming and climate change and environmental pressure.

Climate change adaptation activities predominantly require an understanding of the range of impacts on the water resource. In this study, we assessed climate change impacts on the Blue Nile River using 30-year in situ climate data (1981-2010) and five bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) for future (2026-2045) climate projections of RCP8.5. Both historical and GCM precipitation projections show inter-annual and spatial variability, with the most significant increases in the rainy season and a significant decrease in the dry season. The results suggest the probability of an increase in total precipitation. The intensity and frequency of future extreme rainfall events will also increase. Moreover, the hydrological model simulation results show a likely increase in total river flow, peak discharges, flood inundation, and evapotranspiration that will lead to a higher risk of floods and droughts in the future. These results suggest that the operation of water storage systems (e.g., the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam) should be optimized for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and irrigation management in addition to their intended purposes in the Nile basin.

To address this gap, we analyzed proposals for on-the-ground climate adaptation projects submitted by US conservation non-profits, which play a central role in conserving biodiversity. We assessed 415 proposals submitted between 2011 and 2015 to the Wildlife Conservation Society's Climate Adaptation Fund, a US-based fund focused solely on adaptation for wildlife and ecosystems. We evaluated the distribution of proposed projects across conservation targets, strategies, and activities, and their geographic alignment with climate impacts. Proposals most often targeted river and riparian ecosystems, fish, and birds. Attention on amphibians and invertebrates was disproportionately low relative to their climate vulnerability. Proposals commonly included efforts to restore previous structures and functions, while relatively few described facilitating change (e.g., supporting future-adapted species). Proposal density was highest along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, geographically aligned with non-profit density and public opinion on climate change. There was no geographic alignment between exposure and proposed responses to five of six climate threats (warming, aridity, wildfire, inland flooding, sea level rise). Our findings identify gaps in adaptation attention, and can enhance strategic resource allocation, targeted capacity building, and adaptation outcomes for conservation.

J	Palinkas, LA; O'Donnell, ML; Lau, W; Wong, M				Palinkas, Lawrence A.; O'Donnell, Meaghan L.; Lau, Winnie; Wong, Marleen			Strategies for Delivering Mental Health Services in Response to Global Climate Change: A Narrative Review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						mental health services; climate change; disasters; trauma; prevention; treatment	PSYCHOLOGICAL 1ST AID; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL-CHILDREN; INTERVENTION; DROUGHT; CARE; DISTRESS; WORKERS; TEMPERATURE; CONFLICT	This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience.

J	Qiang, YJ; Zhang, LM; Xiao, T				Qiang, Yejia; Zhang, Limin; Xiao, Te			Spatial-temporal rain field generation for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area considering climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Spatial-temporal rain field generator; Rainstorm; Climate change; Natural hazards; Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area; Flooding	PEARL RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; STOCHASTIC GENERATION; HOURLY RAINFALL; RISK-ASSESSMENT; SOIL SLOPES; MODEL; RELIABILITY; SIMULATION; EVENTS	A stochastic rainfall generator is required to provide rainfall inputs for the analysis and mitigation of such hydrological or geologic hazards as floods and rain-induced landslides. This paper presents a new spatial-temporal rainstorm generator for generating simultaneous rainfall processes at numerous locations considering the spatial correlation among these locations and interpolating the point processes into an areal rain field. The generator is able to include the effect of climate change by adjusting the parameters of the marginal distributions of variables constituting rainfall events. A case study on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), one of the regions that are most prone to storm-related disasters in the world, is presented. The performance of the proposed generator is excellent in reproducing the historical statistical characteristics of regional rainfall. The model is adapted to climate change through extrapolation of the variation trend of the model parameters in the observation period to explore possible future scenarios of regional rainfall in GBA. The simulation results indicate a significant increase in rainfall extremes, especially for short-duration rainfall, at the end of 21st century in GBA.

J	Laino, E; Iglesias, G				Laino, Emilio; Iglesias, Gregorio			High-level characterisation and mapping of key climate-change hazards in European coastal cities	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Climate change; Extreme impacts; Coastal flooding; Coastal erosion; Coastal cities; GIS; Mapping	SEA-LEVEL; FLOOD RISK; EXTREME EVENTS; WAVE FARMS; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; PROTECTION; DISASTERS	Sea-level and temperature rise due to climate change exacerbate existing climate-related hazards in coastal areas. In this work, an approach based on Coastal City Living Labs is developed to carry out a high-level characterisation of key climate-related hazards for ten European coastal cities. The Coastal City Living Labs are conceived as physical and virtual spaces in which stakeholders meet for collaboration, co-creation and co-ideation to solve the challenges posed by climate-related hazards. The information on past extreme climate events and local knowledge thus obtained are combined to identify the main hazards for each city. Subsequently, these hazards are categorised based on the recommendations of the recent Sixth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The main climate-related hazards are found to be storms, coastal and land flooding, and coastal erosion. Importantly, significant differences are found between the specific cities as to the main hazards of concern. Even within the same coastal city, relevant differences are found in respect of the main hazards, depending on the area considered. It follows that granularity in the characterisation of the hazards is fundamental in designing mitigation measures. To clarify the spatial extent of the different hazards in each coastal city, bespoke maps are produced through GIS software. In addition to the interest of the results for the specific cities investigated, this work provides a methodology to assess climate-related hazards in coastal areas using Coastal City Living Labs, which can be applied elsewhere.Kindly check and confirm the inserted city name for affiliation 2 is correctly identified.CorrectKindly check and confirm the corresponing author mail ID is correctly identified.Correct	[Laino, Emilio; Iglesias, Gregorio] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Sch Engn & Architecture, Cork, Ireland; [Iglesias, Gregorio] Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Marine Bldg,Drake Circus, Plymouth, England	University College Cork; University of Plymouth	Iglesias, G (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Sch Engn & Architecture, Cork, Ireland.; Iglesias, G (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn Comp & Math, Marine Bldg,Drake Circus, Plymouth, England.	gregorio.iglesias@ucc.ie	Iglesias, Gregorio/E-5114-2012	Iglesias, Gregorio/0000-0003-2719-1663	Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [H2020-LC-CLA-13-2020, 101003534]; European Commission through the SCORE project, SMART CONTROL OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN EUROPEAN COASTAL CITIES; SCORE consortium	Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(Horizon 2020); European Commission through the SCORE project, SMART CONTROL OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN EUROPEAN COASTAL CITIES; SCORE consortium	E.

The climate projections from global circulation models indicate even more intense and frequent extreme events in the future, which in turn pose more risks to socioeconomic infrastructure. The enhanced understanding of the climate-related financial risk associated with businesses has driven efforts to include critical information on probable risks associated with climate change in financial decision-making. In this study, we have presented a framework to assess the need of incorporating climate risk assessment as an integral part of business operations. We also reviewed revealed literature to understand the possible impacts of climate change on various sectors and presented key strategies to assess the climate risk associated with them. Also, a framework incorporating probable climate threats to business ecology with principles of robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy, and rapidity has been proposed to adapt and mitigate associated risks for a climate-resilient business ecosystem. The integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing risk could be a promising tool for enhancing business resilience to climate change and could be used as a tool. Robust and accurate predictions of climate and weather extremes from deep learning algorithms at a significant lead time can help in minimizing the associated risk with a business infrastructure. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), a weather extreme cause huge socioeconomic risk by triggering floods and droughts in various continents of mid-latitude regions. We have presented a case study investigating the ability of deep learning algorithms to predict ARs. The results from the analysis advocate the application of deep learning algorithms to predict weather and climate extremes in decision support systems to enhance the climate resilience of a business ecosystem.

Besides daily rhythms, there exist as well other biological rhythms that have different time scales, including seasonal and annual rhythms. Circadian and other biological rhythms deeply permeate human life, at any level, spanning from the molecular, subcellular, cellular, tissue, and organismal level to environmental exposures, and behavioral lifestyles. Humans are immersed in what has been called the "circadian landscape," with circadian rhythms being highly pervasive and ubiquitous, and affecting every ecosystem on the planet, from plants to insects, fishes, birds, mammals, and other animals. Anthropogenic behaviors have been producing a cascading and compounding series of effects, including detrimental impacts on human health. However, the effects of climate change on sleep have been relatively overlooked. In the present narrative review paper, we wanted to offer a way to re-read/re-think sleep medicine from a planetary health perspective. Climate change, through a complex series of either direct or indirect mechanisms, including (i) pollution- and poor air quality-induced oxygen saturation variability/hypoxia, (ii) changes in light conditions and increases in the nighttime, (iii) fluctuating temperatures, warmer values, and heat due to extreme weather, and (iv) psychological distress imposed by disasters (like floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, and infectious outbreaks by emerging and reemerging pathogens) may contribute to inducing mismatches between internal time and external environment, and disrupting sleep, causing poor sleep quantity and quality and sleep disorders, such as insomnia, and sleep-related breathing issues, among others. Climate change will generate relevant costs and impact more vulnerable populations in underserved areas, thus widening already existing global geographic, age-, sex-, and gender-related inequalities.

J	El-Mahdy, ME				El-Mahdy, Mohamed El-Sayed			A Unified index of water resources systems vulnerability assessment - Translating the theoretical approach into a simple tool to assess climate change Impact: Case study in Limpopo River Basin, Africa	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Vulnerability; Unified index; Water systems; Climate change; Uncertainty; Limpopo River	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INDEX; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; MULTICRITERIA ANALYSIS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; OPTIMIZATION; STREAMFLOW; FRAMEWORK; UNCERTAINTIES; VARIABILITY; MOZAMBIQUE	Water is exposed to various types of stressors. There are environmental stressors or anthropogenic stres -sors, which have direct and/or indirect impacts on climate change. The overall objective of this paper is to develop a pioneer simple tool that can measure the water resources vulnerability due to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The tool is developed under six stages. Stage-1: A list of 28 indicators perti-nent to the present work are generated; Stage-2: The indicators are assorted into two main categories, namely, environmental and anthropogenic indicators; Stage-3: Indicator weights are suggested using expert elicitation procedure; Stage-4: Index formulation is performed consecutively; Stage-5: The pro-posed index is applied; Stage-6: An appropriate adaptation strategy is proposed to each specific country. The developed tool is applied to the Limpopo River basin using 28 indicators. Results show that both the environmentally and anthropogenically driven vulnerability of the four riparian countries are moderate ranging from 41.98% in Mozambique to 47.69% in South Africa. The value of indicators ranges from 0.93% to 98.81% in environmentally driven vulnerability and ranges from 0.00% to 97.66% in anthropogenically driven vulnerability. Climate change is thought to increase the vulnerability of water resources by 9.47% in Mozambique to 13.56% in South Africa. The developed tool can be applied to other river basins and countries elsewhere considering indicator weight.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

Effects of land use/land cover and climatic change on the ecosystem of North Ningxia, China	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Yellow River; Dynamics; LULC; Vulnerability; Remote sensing		Land use/land cover change (LUCC) and climate changes are responsible for degradation of any ecosystem in arid and semi-arid regions. Studying the ecological variations is particularly essential for any type of sustainable development, in which LUCC considers as one of the chief inputs. The main objective is to evaluate the impacts of LUCC and climatic changes on the Ecosystem Vulnerability (ESV) using remote sensing and some statistical models around the Yellow River, Ningxia, China. Eleven classes of LUCC were identified during 1995 and 2019: village land, bare land, grassland, industrial land, irrigated land, swamp land, tidal flat, transportation land, urban land, water bodies, and water channels. Grassland may be decreased annually with percentage - 5.873% due to some human activities and environmental changes in climate from one season to another. About 24.23 km(2)and 24.86 km(2)was converted from grassland to industrial lands and irrigated lands, respectively. ESV has been calculated using LULC, DEM, slope, soil, and geology. About 45% and 60% of 1995 and 2019, respectively, undergone moderate vulnerability. The annual rate of ESVI decreased in low and reasonable but it was increased in moderate, high, and extreme showing - 4.166% as a total percentage of annual vulnerability. High vulnerability area needs proper management. Majority of vegetation area is located in zone under the moderate vulnerability zone; in contrast, grasslands were subjected to high vulnerability. Areas around the Yellow River were subjected to drought and flooding due to climatic change affecting negatively on the production of crops. Also, the desert lands of the study area have been turned to agriculture according to statistical model. Population growth, industrial development, and governmental policies for ecosystem protection were responsible for major changes. This study is more beneficial for decision-making in eco-environmental protecting and planning. Results of this study could help planners in formulating effective strategies for better management of ecosystem.

It is clear that the more accurate the assessment of runoff in the future, the better the evaluation of the impact of land-use and climate changes on water resources. Thus, to more accurately predict water sources in the future, runoff is estimated using two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and SWAT-DEEP-IFSO models. The results showed that the SWAT-DEEP-IFSO model has a better estimation than the SWAT method. Because Deep Belief Network and an improved optimization algorithm called Improved Fluid Search Optimization (IFSO) algorithm have been utilized in optimizing the hybrid SWAT model that can reduce the error of runoff simulation. After selecting the best model for estimating runoff, the effect of land-use and climate change is evaluated using different scenarios. Results show that the simulated runoff under the influence of climate and land-use changes can impact on the average yearly and monthly runoff. These factors have a significant effect on the average yearly runoff changes and are predicted an increasing trend for average yearly runoff. But climate and land-use changes have a different impact on the different months and for some months of the year the runoff has an increasing trend and for some months the runoff has a decreasing trend. Based on land-use scenarios, it is found that due to the decrease in rangelands and increase in agricultural lands, there is a possibility of severe floods and drought periods in the region, which reduces the water resources of the study area.

Applications of HEM include economic evaluations of existing and new water projects, alternative water management actions or policies, risk assessments from hydro-climatic uncertainty (e.g., climate change), and the costs and benefits of mitigation and/or adaptation to such events. This paper reviews applications of HEM in five different categories: (1) climate change impacts and adaptation, (2) water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus management, (3) capability to link to other models, (4) innovative water management options, and (5) the ability to address and integrate uncertainty. We find that (i) the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of water resource management problems due to the growing demand and competition for water across economic sectors, (ii) limited availability and high costs of developing additional supplies, and (iii) emerging recognition and consideration of environmental water demands and value, has inspired new integrated hydro-economic problems and models to address issues of water-food-energy nexus sustainability, resilience, reliability through water (re)allocation based on the relative "value" of water uses. In the past decade, the field of HEM has improved the integration of ecosystem needs, but their representation is still insufficient and mostly ineffective. HEM studies address how to sustainably manage water resources, including groundwater which has become an area of particular interest in climate change adaptation. The current most used spatial and temporal resolutions (basin-scale and yearly time-step) are appropriate for planning but not for operational decisions and could be underestimating impacts from extreme events (e.g., flood risk) captured only by sub-monthly time scales. In addition, HEM primarily focuses on biophysical and economic indicators but often overlooks preferences and perspectives of stakeholders. Lastly, HEM has been widely used to analyze transboundary cooperation, showing benefits for increasing water security and economic development, particularly as climate change develops. We conclude that the field of HEM would benefit from developing more operational models and enhancing the integration of commonly neglected variables, such as social equity components, ecosystem requirements, and water quality.

J	Junqueira, JR; Serrao-Neumann, S; White, I				Junqueira, Juliana Reu; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; White, Iain			Developing and testing a cost-effectiveness analysis to prioritize green infrastructure alternatives for climate change adaptation	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						decision-making; flooding; land use planning; low-impact development (LID); nature-based solutions; stormwater management	URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN	Green infrastructure has been increasingly identified as an option to help manage climate change impacts in urban areas, although its implementation is still not widely promoted in urban planning. This is because of the lack of detailed analysis for decision-makers regarding construction and maintenance costs for different types and how effective various measures are at managing precipitation at a catchment scale. This paper contributes to fill this gap in knowledge by developing a green infrastructure cost-effectiveness ranking index (GICRI) able to evaluate the stormwater runoff volume reduction of multiple green infrastructure alternatives under different climate change scenarios, over differing spatial configurations and combining this performance data with their construction and maintenance costs. After applying this model over two case study areas, this paper provides three main insights. First, climate change projections have a significant impact on green infrastructure cost-effectiveness. Second, as green infrastructure cost-effectiveness is influenced by the spatial scale, there are different challenges for larger cities and smaller regional towns. Building on this, the paper argues that GICRI can be a simple and fast heuristic to increase the use of green infrastructure by informing decision-makers regarding how and where to prioritize investment or where greater modelling is needed.

Assessing Climate Change Impacts on River Flows in the Tonle Sap Lake Basin, Cambodia	WATER			English	Article						climate change; river flow; Tonle Sap; SWAT model; Lower Mekong	MEKONG RIVER; PROJECTIONS; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	The Tonle Sap is the most fertile and diverse freshwater ecosystem in Southeast Asia, receiving nurturing water flows from the Mekong and its immediate basin. In addition to rapid development in the Tonle Sap basin, climate change may threaten natural flow patterns that sustain its diversity. The impacts of climate change on river flows in 11 sub-basins contributing to the Tonle Sap Lake were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to quantify the potential magnitude of future hydrological alterations. Projected river flows from three General Circulation Models (GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC and IPSL-CM5A-MR) for three time horizons (2030s, 2060s and 2090s) indicate a likely decrease in both the wet and dry season flows. The mean annual projected flow reductions range from 9 to 29%, 10 to 35% and 7 to 41% for the 2030s, 2060s and 2090s projections, respectively. Moreover, a decrease in extreme river flows (Q(5) and Q(95)) was also found, which implies there could be a decline in flood magnitudes and an increase in drought occurrences throughout the basin. The results of this study provide insight for water resources planning and adaptation strategies for the river ecosystems during the dry season, when water flows are projected to decrease.

If extreme events only update beliefs in the short term, there is a risk that long term investments and planning are only made in narrow windows around the events. Using a national survey of New Zealand farmers, we explore the effect of drought intensity on future climate expectations and plans for land-use change, focusing on the window of experience farmers use in planning. Results suggest farmers reference a short-term window rather than the historical record. Higher expectations of drought are also positively associated with land-conversion plans, highlighting the importance of beliefs in adaptation and planning behaviour. Climate change planning and adaptation require long term interest and investment. Our results suggest that short-term fluctuations in drought and weather can affect beliefs, so that a few good years might breed resistance to longer term investment.

Most previous studies focused on optimization problems of infrastructure adaptation for climate change in a single urban district, but multiple key variables of an adaptation plan-investment target, amount, and timing-should be developed simultaneously for interconnected urban districts. Thus, there is a knowledge gap regarding optimization for infrastructure adaptation in interconnected urban districts. This study suggests a model for establishing an infrastructure adaptation plan in urban areas under various climate change scenarios using an optimization method. The proposed model derives the infrastructure investment plan, which includes the key decision variables of investment amount, location, and timing. The model was applied to derive an investment plan for a sewer system covering the 25 administrative districts in Seoul under six future scenarios. The proposed method aims to provide a basis for adaptation planning for urban infrastructure, maximizing benefits from the limited resources.

The research focused on tracing evidence for a catastrophic flood that buried the village beneath a thick layer of debris, including examining the remains of structures and agricultural land sealed beneath the debris, and considering the social and economic implications of the event in the subsequent history of the area. First, a series of test pits was excavated within the area of the modern village to map the full extent of the damage. Following this, analysis of the stratigraphy, architectural remains, datable artefacts and radiocarbon dating contributed further details, while historical evidence revealed the privatisation of the agricultural land following the catastrophe. The findings offer a snapshot of climate change and its social contexts in a specific, under-studied area with possible implications for the study of risk behaviour and disaster response in currently inhabited areas.

The world is rapidly warming, and the consequences of climate change include an increase and intensification in flooding, droughts, wildfires, and other traumatic exposures. Although countries in the Global South have contributed least to global warming, they are the most vulnerable owing to historical inequities. The concept of 'climate justice' recognises that historical racial discrimination, class disenfranchisement, political misrecognition, and other social injustices make surviving climate change and thriving within it more challenging. This narrative review considers the psychological consequences of the climate emergency through a climate justice lens. The article discusses the unequal exposures to psychological adversities, socio-historical barriers to adaptations and, finally, institutional betrayal that complicates the experience of psychological distress. The review concludes by pragmatically discussing how psychology could support climate justice ends.

In the case of India, the rapid urbanization since the end of the twentieth century has exacerbated the impact of climate change at significant environmental, social, and economic costs. Coastal cities in India commonly face climate change related hazards of flooding, rise in sea level, and urban heat islands. This article has assessed the usefulness of scientific information and community knowledge in planning, reviving, and maintaining BGI to make it a successful climate adaptation practice in coastal cities. The existing waterways and water bodies in India's coastal cities are a network linked to the green infrastructure that has been altered by sprawling urbanization. In response to Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13, the cities of Kochi and Chennai have begun a process of recovering their BGI for greater resilience. This research has detected a shift in the social and administrative perception of BGI as a valuable resource for climate adaptation in recent times. Actions in backwaters and canals, promoted by Chennai and Kochi municipal corporations, present new steps toward mainstreaming adaptation of BGI into the local regulatory framework.

The proposed strategy has been developed and tested in a research and design studio, which took place in 2020 at a Master of Architecture degree program in the Netherlands. The studios focused on the sparsely populated, high flood risk region of the Lake District, UK. The Lake District faces urgent climate change challenges that demand effective solutions. On the other hand, the area is a UNESCO heritage site, characterized by massive tourism and tending towards museumification (sic). Three indicative design research projects were selected to illustrate the proposed research by design strategy. The results reveal that this strategy facilitates the iterative research by design process and hence offers a systematic approach to convert the threats of climate change into opportunities by unraveling the potentials of the study area. The findings lay the groundwork for more systematic studies on research by design as an effective strategy for climate change adaptation design. Beyond the local case, the results contribute to the critical theories on climate adaptation design and research by design methodologies.

J	Werg, JL; Grothmann, T; Löchtefeld, S				Werg, Jana Lorena; Grothmann, Torsten; Loechtefeld, Stefan			Fostering Self-Protection against Impacts of Heavy Rain at the Municipal Level	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						heavy rain; weather extremes; climate change; adaptation; municipality; household level; self-protection; perception	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; BEHAVIOR; RISK	Local governments are highly relevant actors when it comes to mitigating climate change impacts such as flooding. Not only do they need to implement regulatory and infrastructural measures, but they also need to promote complementing self-protective measures at the household level. The individual motivation of municipal actors to pursue climate adaptation can be important for the implementation of such measures, obviously alongside several other factors, such as financial and administrative issues. A questionnaire survey with a non-random sample of 77 local government actors from 15 of the 16 German federal states was conducted, focusing on potential key factors concerning the motivation to implement adaptation measures against hazardous impacts of heavy rain. Additionally, the perceived effectiveness and realizability of selected municipal structural measures and of activation measures promoting self-protective behavior were collected. It can be shown that the perceived realizability of adaptation measures as well as knowledge of risk and adaptation may be key factors in the motivation to implement both activation and structural measures, while motivation and implementation are only partially related. The results imply a need for the evaluation of activation measures and a need for further research on the motivation of municipal actors to implement activation measures.

The changes in the average runoff, high extreme runoff and intra-annual runoff distribution in the middle of the 21st century are analyzed. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) Compared with the base period (1970-1990), the average runoff of Tangnaihai, Toudaoguai, Sanmenxia and Lijin hydrological stations in the future period (2040-2060) all shows an increasing trend, and the probability of flood disaster also tends to increase; (2) Land use/cover change (LUCC) under the status quo continuation scenario will increase the possibility of future flood disasters; (3) The spring runoff proportion of the four hydrological stations in the future period shows a decreasing trend, which increases the risk of drought in spring. The winter runoff proportion tends to increase; (4) The monthly runoff proportion of the four hydrological stations in the future period tends to decrease in April, May, June, July and October. The monthly runoff proportion tends to increase in January, February, August, September and December.

J	Huang, CF; Li, N; Zhang, ZT; Liu, Y; Chen, X; Wang, F				Huang, Chengfang; Li, Ning; Zhang, Zhengtao; Liu, Yuan; Chen, Xi; Wang, Fang			Assessment of the economic cascading effect on future climate change in China: Evidence from agricultural direct damage	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Economic cascading effect; ARIO model; Agriculture; Climate change; China	INPUT-OUTPUT; DISASTER IMPACT; FLOOD RISK; LOSSES; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; MODELS; HEALTH	The agricultural sector is extremely vulnerable to climate change and also plays a very important role in the operation of the entire economic system, leading many studies to evaluate the possible agricultural direct economic damage (ADED) of climate change. However, this damage may have an amplification impact through the intricate industrial linkages that exist among sectors, and this impact may be even greater than the original damage. Therefore, to elucidate the economic cascading effect (ECE) in China caused by ADED and industrial linkage, this paper used the ARIO model to evaluate the total ECE and analyse the differences in the 19 sectors by taking the ADED under future annual mean temperature (AMT) increases of 1-5 degrees C as the input condition and adjusting the exogenous parameters to enhance the adaptability of the model; the goal was to assess the economic impact of climate change in China. The results show that (i) there is a significant amplifying impact of ECE due to industrial linkage under the influence of warming, ECE will be 4.24-5.25 times that of ADED, and the total economic impact (ADED thorn ECE) will exceed the GDP of the Chinese capital of Beijing in 2012 when the AMT increases by 1.5 degrees C, while it will exceed one tenth of China's GDP when it increases by 4 degrees C. (ii) Manufacturing will be the sector most affected by the industrial linkage under ADED, which accounts for 26.58% of total ECE, followed by agriculture (10.39%) and construction (8.5%). (iii) The decrease in cultivated land area will have a significant impact on the economy; when it is reduced to the minimum demand (1.41% less than 2012), ADED increases by 1.65 times and ECE increases by 2.35 times. This paper aims to provide a new perspective from which to evaluate the economic impact of climate change by studying ECEs behind sectoral interactions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Performance of lot-level low impact development technologies under historical and climate change scenarios	JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Stormwater management; Modeling; Sponge city; Low impact development (LID); Lot-level; Climate change; SWMM		Low impact development (LID) systems have potential to make urban cities more sustainable and resilient, particularly under challenging climate conditions. To quantify performance capabilities, modeling results for an array of combinations of LIDs are described using PCSWMM at lot-level to examine performance of individual LIDs on volume and peak flow reductions. Among the four LIDs studied: rain barrel (RB), vegetative swale (VS), bioretention cell (BC), and permeable pavement (PP), PP at lot-level demonstrated the best capability for reducing surface runoff volumes and peak runoff rates under historical weather conditions, while BC showed similar capability for reduction of runoff volumes but minimal peak flow reduction. With PP as the controlling method at lot-level, the maximum percentage reduction of runoff volume for a 2-year storm is 58% whereas for a 100-year storm, the runoff volume reduction is 20%. These results mean the extent of flooding that may arise from the 100-year storm is reduced, but not eliminated. Effectively, the 100-year storm volumes with LID are devolved to have flooding equivalent to a 25-year storm. Under climate change scenarios, performance for all LIDs declined at various levels, where BC was the most resilient LID for a climate change scenario, such that projected 2-year or 5-year storms with climate change will have its impact devolved with LID in place, to result in similar volumes and peaks without LID under historical conditions. Furthermore, even with an assembly of lotlevel LIDs distributed throughout the community, there is not attenuation to substantial degrees of flooding for major events, but there can be effective control for water quantity for small (2- to 5-years in particular) storm events.

Developing hydrological models with better capabilities to simulate streamflow, especially peak flow, is urgently needed to facilitate water resource planning and management as well as climate change mitigation efforts in the tropics. In view of the need, this paper explores the feasibility of improving streamflow simulation performance in the tropical Kelantan River Basin (KRB) of Peninsular Malaysia through coupling a conceptual process-based hydrological model -Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a deep learning model -Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) in two ways. All SWAT parameters were set as their default values in one hybrid model (SWAT-D-LSTM), whereas three most sensitive SWAT parameters were calibrated in the other hybrid model (SWAT-T-LSTM). Comparison of daily streamflow simulation results have shown that SWAT-T-LSTM consistently performs better than SWAT-D-LSTM as well as the stand-alone SWAT and Bi-LSTM model throughout the simulation period. Particularly, SWAT-T-LSTM performs considerably better than the other three models in simulating daily peak flow. Based on the latest projection results of five GCMs from the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) under three emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5), the best-performed SWAT-T-LSTM was run to assess the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow in the KRB. Ensemble assessment results have concluded that both average and extreme streamflow is much likely to increase considerably in the already wet northeast monsoon season from November to January, which has surely raised the alarm for more frequent flood occurrence in the KRB.

J	Huang, Y; Ma, YG; Liu, T; Luo, M				Huang, Yue; Ma, Yonggang; Liu, Tie; Luo, Min			Climate Change Impacts on Extreme Flows Under IPCC RCP Scenarios in the Mountainous Kaidu Watershed, Tarim River Basin	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						distributed hydrological model; climate change; water resources; extreme events	SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERN; FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; MODEL EVALUATION; ANNUAL RUNOFF; XINJIANG; PRECIPITATION; REGIONS	In the 21st century, heavier rainfall events and warmer temperatures in mountainous regions have significant impacts on hydrological processes and the occurrence of flood/drought extremes. Long-term modeling and peak flow detection of streamflow series are crucial in understanding the behavior of flood and drought. This study was conducted to analyze the impacts of future climate change on extreme flows in the Kaidu River Basin, northwestern China. The soil water assessment tool (SWAT) was used for hydrological modeling. The projected future precipitation and temperature under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were downscaled and used to drive the validated SWAT model. A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution was employed to assess the probability distribution of flood events. The modeling results showed that the simulated discharge well matched the observed ones both in the calibration and validation periods. Comparing with the historical period, the ensemble with 15 general circulation models (GCMs) showed that the annual precipitation will increase by 7.9-16.1% in the future, and extreme precipitation events will increase in winter months. Future temperature will increase from 0.42 degrees C/10 a to 0.70 degrees C/10 a. However, with respect to the hydrological response to climate change, annual mean runoff will decrease by 21.5-40.0% under the mean conditions of the four RCP scenarios. A reduction in streamflow will occur in winter, while significantly increased discharge will occur from April to May. In addition, designed floods for return periods of five, 10 and 20 years in the future, as predicted by the GEV distribution, will decrease by 3-20% over the entire Kaidu watershed compared to those in the historical period. The results will be used to help local water resource management with hazard warning and flood control.

The potential influence of climate change on the storm itself has been debated, but sea level rise driven by anthropogenic climate change more clearly contributed to damages. To quantify this effect, here we simulate water levels and damage both as they occurred and as they would have occurred across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates of attributable sea level rise. We find that approximately $8.1B ($4.7B-$14.0B, 5th-95th percentiles) of Sandy's damages are attributable to climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise, as is extension of the flood area to affect 71 (40-131) thousand additional people. The same general approach demonstrated here may be applied to impact assessments for other past and future coastal storms. Sea level rise amplifies coastal storm impacts, but the role of anthropogenic climate change is poorly resolved. Here the authors reassess Hurricane Sandy, using a dynamic flood model to show that anthropogenic sea level rise added a central estimate of $8 billion in damages.

They provide important services, like water supply, recreation opportunities, flood and climate regulation. Still, they are also considered as disruptive areas, a source of mosquitoes and diseases, which is why they are frequently destroyed by changes in land use. Their degradation is likely to advance from this time forth due to climate change processes. It is, therefore, important to examine how the local population understands the importance of wetlands in coping with different coastal risks in West Sardinia. Our study is focused on West Sardinia (municipalities Cabras, Oristano and Arborea), counting for remarkable biodiversity of wetlands. This area is characterized by high environmental and agricultural pressures which intensify the vulnerability of the coastal areas. To test for local population's preparedness to change, data collection was performed through field methods and questionnaires. The study was undertaken by asking key questions on the role of wetlands and willingness to pay to protect from future events (contingent valuation exercise). The results indicate that the locals do not seem to be aware of the regulating services provided by wetlands, but are willing to invest in order to mitigate climate change-related hazards. The obtained results could serve in future governance frameworks for the mitigation of natural hazards in the Mediterranean region and wider.

This study systematically assessed climate change impacts on runoff and floods in the Fujiang River basin, which is the main tributary of the upper Yangtze River, China, using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) driven by the latest climate simulation of 14 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). This study indicates a generally warmer and wetter climate projected in the Fujiang River basin, and correspondingly an overall increase in projected ensemble annual mean runoff, monthly runoff, monthly high flow (Q05), and monthly low flow (Q95) in the periods of 2021-2060 and 2061-2100, with the long-term period being more substantial than that of the near future, especially for SSP5-8.5. However, the projected changes in monthly runoff show a large spread across GCMs, with greater increases mainly occurring in the early rainy season. Most of the GCMs show that projections of Q95 will substantially increase compared to Q05. The intensity and frequency of floods with a 30-year return period are likely to increase, especially under SSP5-8.5. Despite the uncertainties in projected future changes in runoff, these findings highlight the complexity of runoff response to climate change, promoting the need for adaptive water resource management.

J	von Uexkull, N; Loy, A; d'Errico, M				von Uexkull, Nina; Loy, Agnese; d'Errico, Marco			Climate, flood, and attitudes toward violence: micro-level evidence from Karamoja, Uganda	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Armed conflict; Pastoralist conflict; Flood impacts; Attitudes to violence; Uganda	CONFLICT; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; SECURITY; GENOCIDE; SUPPORT; UNREST	Concerns about the security implications of climate change are increasing. The growing academic literature on the topic suggests that linkages between climate change and armed conflict are shaped by structural risk factors, but micro-level variation and mechanisms remain poorly understood and flood responses are hardly studied. In this paper, we strive to contribute to a better understanding of such micro-level patterns and investigate how flood exposure affects the support for violence in the Karamoja region of Uganda, which is characterized by many structural vulnerabilities to climate change and armed conflict. We use unique household-level survey panel data and investigate changes in survey responses following a destructive flood. Our study finds that flood exposure was associated with greater support for the use of violence. However, while we identify some adverse impacts of flood exposure on the perceived and actual socio-economic conditions of households and a decrease in perceptions of government support, these do not seem to mediate the estimated flood impact on support for violence against expectations. Our findings point to the limited explanatory power of natural hazards' economic impacts alone for conflict risk. Further investigation of causal mechanisms between climate hazards and conflict remains an important priority for future research.

The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on streamflow and floodplain inundation in the subtropical Logan Albert catchment, Australia. An ensemble of 11 high-resolution climate models forced under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 RCP8.5) and intermediate-emission (RCP4.5) scenarios was applied. There was considerable variation from the model ensemble result in projections of major flooding events at 5 and 100-year average recurrence intervals (ARIs). The largest events (100-year ARI) tended towards an increase, whereas the smallest (5-year ARI) tended towards a decrease. Floodplain inundation from a 100-year ARI event increased in all simulations and inclusion of sea level rise resulted in increased floodplain inundation area nearly doubling by the end of the century, which has substantial implications for flood risk. Our study highlights the non-linear nature of climate change impacts on streamflow and floodplain inundation, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive assessment at the floodplain scale when informing preparedness for future flooding events.

J	Kim, J; Kang, J				Kim, Jaekyoung; Kang, Junsuk			Analysis of Flood Damage in the Seoul Metropolitan Government Using Climate Change Scenarios and Mitigation Technologies	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood mitigation; climate change scenario; mitigating technology; Huff curves; green infrastructure; evidence-based planning	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; MODEL; MANAGEMENT	The social and economic damages caused by climate change have increased rapidly over the last several decades, with increasing instances of heatwaves, floods, and extreme rainfall. In 2011, heavy rain of 110.5 mm/hr caused great damage to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Most of the causes of flooding in modern cities include a sharp increase in non-permeable pavement and a lack of water circulation facilities. It is predicted that heavy rainfalls will occur in the future, causing large amounts of local damage. In this study, possible future flood damages were analyzed using climate change scenarios based on the Korean Peninsula. ArcGIS was adopted to perform analyses, and Huff curves were employed for precipitation analysis. Water tanks, permeable pavement, and ecological waterways were installed as mitigation technologies. These three technologies can contribute to flooding mitigation by increasing the rainwater storage capacity. This study suggests that all floods can be reduced by RCP 8.5 by 2050 and 2060. Although there will be run-off after 2050, it is believed that technology will significantly reduce the volume and possibility of floods. It is recommended that a one-year analysis should be conducted in consideration of the maintenance aspects that will arise in the future.

Drivers of changing urban flood risk: A framework for action	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Urban flood risk; Climate change; Urban flood management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; WATER-QUALITY; URBANIZATION; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; INSURANCE; VULNERABILITY; RUNOFF; RESILIENCE	This study focuses on drivers for changing urban flood risk. We suggest a framework for guiding climate change adaptation action concerning flood risk and manageability in cities. The identified key drivers of changing flood hazard and vulnerability are used to provide an overview of each driver's impact on flood risk and manageability at the city level. We find that identified drivers for urban flood risk can be grouped in three different priority areas with different time horizon. The first group has high impact but is manageable at city level. Typical drivers in this group are related to the physical environment such as decreasing permeability and unresponsive engineering. The second group of drivers is represented by public awareness and individual willingness to participate and urbanization and urban sprawl. These drivers may be important and are manageable for the cities and they involve both short-term and long-term measures. The third group of drivers is related to policy and long-term changes.

J	Brügger, A; Demski, C; Capstick, S				Bruegger, Adrian; Demski, Christina; Capstick, Stuart			How Personal Experience Affects Perception of and Decisions Related to Climate Change: A Psychological View	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Review						Social Science; Extreme events; Communications; decision making; Decision support; Education; Societal impacts	RISK INFORMATION-SEEKING; SELECTIVE EXPOSURE; CHANGE MITIGATION; LOCAL WEATHER; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES; ATTITUDE IMPORTANCE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; SELF-REFERENCE; FEAR APPEALS	The proportion of the world's population exposed to above-average monthly temperatures has been rising consistently in recent decades and will continue to grow. This and similar trends make it more likely that people will personally experience extreme weather events and seasonal changes related to climate change. A question that follows from this is to what extent experiences may influence climate-related beliefs, attitudes, and the willingness to act. Although research is being done to examine the effects of such experiences, many of these studies have two important shortcomings. First, they propose effects of experiences but remain unclear on the psychological processes that underlie those effects. Second, if they do make assumptions about psychological processes, they do not typically corroborate them with empirical evidence. In other words, a considerable body of research in this field rests on relatively unfounded intuitions. To advance the theoretical understanding of how experiences of climate change could affect the motivation to act on climate change, we introduce a conceptual framework that organizes insights from psychology along three clusters of processes: 1) noticing and remembering, 2) mental representations, and 3) risk processing and decision-making. Within each of these steps, we identify and explicate psychological processes that could occur when people personally experience climate change, and we formulate theory-based, testable hypotheses. By making assumptions explicit and tying them to findings from basic and applied research from psychology, this paper provides a solid basis for future research and for advancing theory. Significance Statement A growing number of people experience environmental changes and weather events that are likely manifestations of human-made climate change (e.g., heat waves, wildfires, or floods). Research has started to examine whether experiencing events influences how ordinary people feel about climate change and possible measures to reduce its extent and to adapt to its consequences. The purpose of this review is to identify and explain in detail psychological processes that could occur when people personally experience climate change and formulate theory-based, testable hypotheses that focus on three clusters of processes (noticing and remembering, mental representations, and decision-making). This work provides a solid basis for future research and for advancing theory.

This paper takes the agroecosystem as the research object, uses the vulnerability model based on "sensitivity-exposure-adaptability" and "vulnerability-risk, source-risk receptor" drought and flood risk models, and establishes multi-index prediction systems covering climate change, population, agricultural technology, economy, ecology, and other factors. Using a combination of AHP and the entropy weighting method, we predict the vulnerability and risk of droughts and floods in China's agroecosystem under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios from 2020 to 2050. The results show that as the scenario changes from SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5 in turn, drought and flood vulnerability intensify, and the drought or flood vulnerability area expands to southern China. At the same time, future drought and flood risk patterns present the characteristics of high risk in Northeast, North, Central, and Southwest China. Therefore, major grain-producing provinces such as Heilongjiang and Henan need to do a good job of preventing and responding to agroecosystem drought and flood risks by strengthening regional structural and nonstructural measures.

However, the current design practice in urban drainage infrastructure remains firmly bound to deterministic assumptions regarding the design load. This approach is too simplified-focusing only on the return period of the design event-and ignores the complexity of drainage systems and the potential changes in catchment hydrology and the at-risk valuable assets within. Therefore, the current design approach is inherently an unsustainable practice that cannot deal with extreme uncertainties associated with urban drainage and flood resilience in changing climate and society. This paper examines the current deterministic design practice and encourages a collective discussion on the need for a paradigm shift in the engineering of pluvial floods toward a risk-based design. We believe that adopting a risk-based design will partially address the uncertainty and complexity of climate and urban drainage, respectively, although a method for the new practice in a risk-based design paradigm must be developed.

Cities are attempting to both reduce their impact on the environment and build resilience to be able to face the irreversible effects of CC through plans and strategies. However, barriers, such as the fact that cities are complex systems and the uncertainty posed by CC have led to less engaged and committed city stakeholders, which have hampered the operationalisation of city resilience. In this context, developing city stakeholders awareness has been demonstrated to be an effective way to put an end to passive behaviour and help transform cities so they are more climate-resilient. Thus, we posit that developing city stakeholder awareness leads to more effective implementation of CC resilience-building plans. To that end, this paper presents a framework that defines the awareness-development process and combines it with an educational simulation tool that facilitates understanding of the theory presented in the framework. Finally, the paper presents a pilot test in the city of Kristiansand, Norway, to show the contribution of the simulation tool in improving city stakeholder awareness.

The adopted methodology relies on two hydrological models (GRSD and LARSIM), used jointly with an ensemble of climate projections disaggregated at the local scale. The impacts were quantified with several indicators describing rivers regimes, floods and low flows. The evolutions of mean interannual streamflow indicate a slight increase, which could even become important for the radiative scenario RCP 8.5 (the most pessimistic one in terms of climate warming). Flood could intensify in the near future (2021-2050). In the far future (2071-2100), the evolution of floods indicators is more uncertain, as the hydrological projections diverge. Low flows could be decreasing in the near future. Their evolution in the far future is more uncertain, going from drastic decrease to sensible rise depending on the chosen scenario. The results were compared to those from previous impact studies performed on the basin. Given the methodological differences and the obtained results, we can conclude that the MOSARH21 project is consistent with the conclusions of the previous studies.

The residents of Kannagi Nagar, built on flood-prone marshlands, are exposed to the risks of flooding and water scarcity. Data were collected at the household level through a questionnaire and interviews to investigate activities contributing to community resilience, their interrelatedness, and the influence of community resilience and risk appraisal on household adaptation behaviour. Findings show that community resilience - assessed using the five core dimensions of trust, place attachment, collective efficacy, social networks and social support - significantly and positively influences adaptation actions. This implies that only when the inhabitants of Kannagi Nagar are supported by their social networks and have confidence in their community's capabilities, can greater risk awareness increase the number of adaptation measures taken.

Assessing present and future risk of water damage using building attributes, meteorology, and topography	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						climate change risk; generalised additive model; non-life insurance; pluvial flooding; topographical risk	GENERALIZED ADDITIVE-MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTIONS; EVENTS	Weather-related risk makes the insurance industry inevitably concerned with climate and climate change. Buildings hit by pluvial flooding is a key manifestation of this risk, giving rise to compensations for the induced physical damages and business interruptions. In this work, we establish a nationwide, building-specific risk score for water damage associated with pluvial flooding in Norway. We fit a generalised additive model that relates the number of water damages to a wide range of explanatory variables that can be categorised into building attributes, climatological variables, and topographical characteristics. The model assigns a risk score to every location in Norway, based on local topography and climate, which is not only useful for insurance companies but also for city planning. Combining our model with an ensemble of climate projections allows us to project the (spatially varying) impacts of climate change on the risk of pluvial flooding towards the middle and end of the 21st century.

The Relevance of Critical Infrastructure	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						critical infrastructure; coastal flooding; exposure; Europe; risk analysis; climate change; indirect risk	FUTURE; DISRUPTION; LOSSES	The effects of climate change imply an increase in the risk levels due to coastal flooding. These areas present a high concentration of population and economic activity. The failure of critical infrastructures (CI) serving these communities can have significant impacts on these sectors. This study aims to analyze the risk and its future evolution due to climate change in coastal areas, considering the increased impact that the population would experience if the CI (of the energy or water and waste treatment sectors) were affected by coastal flooding. The methodology used has made it possible to analyze the risk of the Functional Urban Areas (FUA) of the European coasts, identifying the areas in which the level of risk to the population is significantly underestimated. In some of these areas and scenarios, the population affected by coastal flooding if the failure of the CI occurs would be up to 4.5 times higher than what is estimated if only their direct impact is considered.

These projections usually focus on changes in hydrological signatures, such as 100-year floods, which are estimated through statistical analyses of simulated flows under baseline and future conditions. However, models used for these simulations are traditionally calibrated to reproduce entire flow series, rather than statistics of hydrological signatures. Here, we consider this dichotomy by testing whether performance indicators (e.g. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) are informative about model ability to reproduce distributions and trends in the signatures. Results of streamflow simulations in 50 high-latitude catchments with the 3DNet-Catch model show that high model performances according to traditional indicators do not provide assurance that distributions or trends in hydrological signatures are well reproduced. We therefore suggest that performance in reproducing distributions and trends in hydrological signatures should be included in the process of model selection for climate change impact studies.

This paper proposes to produce such simulations by combining a weather generator for high-resolution gridded daily precipitation, trained on a historical observation-based gridded data product, with coarser-scale climate change information obtained using a regional climate model. The climate change information can be added to various components of the weather generator, related to both the probability of precipitation as well as the amount of precipitation on wet days. The information is added in a transparent manner, allowing for an assessment of the plausibility of the added information. In a case study of nine hydrological catchments in central Norway with the study areas covering 1000-5500 km(2), daily simulations are obtained on a 1 km grid for a period of 19 years. The method yields simulations with realistic temporal and spatial structures and outperforms empirical quantile delta mapping in terms of marginal performance.

The present study evaluated the effect of a rainfall flood event on coralligenous reefs. The flooded site was compared to three control sites using a Before/After-Control/Impact (BACI) design. Sites were sampled using the STAR (STAndaRdized coralligenous evaluation procedure) approach and three ecological indices (ESCA, COARSE and ISLA) were calculated. At the disturbed site the number of species per sample, beta diversity, sensitivity levels of assemblages and the values of the three indices were lower after the flooding event, while the same variables did not decrease at the control sites. Algal turf and Dictyotales increased at the disturbed sites after the flood event, while Udoteaceae, erect sponges, bryozoans and Corallium rubrum decreased. This study provides evidence for identifying floods as a further cause of degradation for the coralligenous reef assemblages.	[Piazzi, L.; Cinti, M.

In the face of the projected increase in losses and damages, the anticipation and measures needed for adaptation involve physical, socioeconomic and political dimensions at different governance levels and timescales. A large literature addresses these various issues, generally in a targeted way. Drawing on adaptive policy pathways approaches and on research results of the past decade in mainland France, this article proposes an interdisciplinary characterisation of long-term adaptation pathways in coastal areas. Among the different variables and processes of change that characterise coastal zones and their future, particular emphasis is placed on social and institutional dynamics. This work contributes to the debate about adaptive governance in a highly uncertain context as well as to recent work to explore pathways and tipping points in support of climate adaptation policies.

Current debates tend to consider actions to respond to climate change as either adaptive or maladaptive, leading to binary framings of outcomes as either successful or harmful. To address this, our article considers the vast space that exists between success and failure in climate change adaptation, highlighting the importance of applying the concepts of successful adaptation and maladaptation jointly in analyses of such outcomes. To this end, we develop an integrated framework to examine the major adaptive and maladaptive effects induced by large-scale seawater desalination. Now a major component of water supply in cities and regions around the world, desalination is increasingly viewed as an adaptation to water challenges linked with climate change. Based on a comprehensive review of the (successful/mal)adaptation literature, we present a matrix that will help academics and practitioners think through the complex and overlapping outcomes of adaptation via desalination in the water sector. We then discuss the insights concerning the configurations of desalination's adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. Overall, we present a threefold argument: (1) that examining successful outcomes alongside maladaptive ones enables a more complete and nuanced understanding of the overall effects of adaptation actions and their spatial and temporal distribution; (2) that a consideration of this can help to highlight the tradeoffs and constraints that are inherent in adaptation in order to support decision-making; and (3) that a more complex approach to adaptation outcomes can assist in problematizing the social-political drivers and consequences of adaptation.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was first calibrated (1988-1993) and validated (2008-2013) at daily time scale for streamflow. Then, bias-corrected and downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate data from 2035 to 2060 with eleven climate models under two different representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) were fed into SWAT to quantify the effects of future climate. Watershed LULC change was represented in SWAT via a future projected dataset developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Past, present, and future potential streamflow responses to LULC and climate changes were analyzed for various ecologically relevant flow parameters. A total of 38 key flow parameters known to have significant impacts on aquatic flora and fauna were examined including high, low, and median flows, as well as flashiness. Increased summer temperature and decreased fall precipitation are expected in the study region accompanied by rapid urbanization. Climate change is expected to increase maximum monthly streamflows, especially in June-September potentially altering habitat availability for aquatic organisms. When climate change was combined with LULC change, more frequent drought and flood events are expected, which may negatively affect many fish species. Significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme streamflow conditions were also predicted in the future, which may adversely impact the life cycle of various aquatic species.

Taking the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China (APTZNC) as an example, this paper developed an approach of sustainable urban landscape planning (SULP) under the stress of climate change in the DNC. First, we quantify the amount of water resources under the future climate change impacts (CCI). Then, we adjust the urban land area based on water resources carrying capacity constraints. Finally, we use the LUSD-urban (Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban) model to adjust the configuration of the urban landscape to avoid occupying important natural habitats and corridors, prime croplands, and floodplains. We find that the SULP can effectively mitigate the comprehensive effects of regional urban landscape dynamics on water resources, food security, ecological security, and flood risks. By performing the SULP, prime croplands, floodplains, and important natural habitats and corridors occupied by urban land will decrease by 2,187 km(2), 750 km(2), and 130 km(2), respectively, during the period of 2015-2050 in the APTZNC. We also find that the proposed approach can effectively manage the impacts of climate change on water resource capacity and reduce water stress of the entire APTZNC and its sub-regions. Thus, the proposed SULP approach and the experiences from the case study in the APTZNC are helpful for guiding urban landscape planning to achieve sustainable development of cities in the DNC and even in the drylands around the world.

Risk-informed design and safety assessment of structures in a changing climate: a review of US practice and a path forward	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Review; Early Access						Bridges; Buildings; climate change; hazards; probability; reliability; structural engineering; structural safety; wind	LOAD CRITERIA; RELIABILITY; WIND	Standards for the design of bridges, buildings and other infrastructure specify design loads for climatic hazards such as temperature, snow, wind, and floods based on return periods presented in maps or tables that account for regional differences. These design loads were developed from statistical analyses of historical hazard data under the assumption that the past is representative of the future. Climate change may affect the frequencies and intensities of environmental hazards which, depending on regional variations, raises questions as to whether structures designed to current specifications will meet minimum safety standards over their future service lives. This paper critically appraises issues related to using historical hazard data for future designs. It reviews basic principles of uniform reliability, that modern design codes use as the basis for ensuring minimum levels of safety, describing the relationship between hazard return periods, structural reliability, risk and the maximum loads expected within a structure's service life. Simple examples involving wind effects on structures demonstrate how to calibrate structural design hazard maps for climate-related extreme events to meet the minimum standards of safety implied in current specifications. The paper also introduces a possible practical approach to account for climate change when designing new structures and assessing the safety of existing facilities.

This can be attributed to conflicting conservation and human development needs and exacerbated by climate change impacts, especially episodic drought and flooding events. We use a case study from Rwanda in the Kagera River Basin in Eastern Africa to contextualize and examine how land use cover change, water access, and agro-ecosystems are vulnerable to myriad human and natural drivers of change. An integrated framework is employed for a nested social-ecological assessment of ecosystem service benefits drawing upon landscape and vulnerability mapping, agro-commodity value chains, and institutional analyses. The conceptual framework and case study provide leverage points for vertical and horizontal linkages that include cross-sectoral partnerships, multi-level governing networks, integrated water resource management, and livelihood security. Moreover, synergy between development and conservation outcomes can be achieved through joint adaptation planning and stewardship initiatives at the local district level with full participation of resource users and community leaders. These lessons from Rwanda and the Kagera River Basin provide opportunities for mainstreaming adaptation and development planning and building resilience towards regional environmental change in Eastern Africa.

J	Cheng, HJ; Park, CY; Cho, MY; Park, C				Cheng, Haojie; Park, Chae Yeon; Cho, Mingyun; Park, Chan			Water requirement of Urban Green Infrastructure under climate change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI); Water management; Water requirement; Irrigation requirement; Climate change	LANDSCAPE PLANTS; ARID ENVIRONMENT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; CALIFORNIA; TREES	The increased uncertainty of rainfall and high urban temperatures resulting from climate change present challenges for water management in Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI). UGI is an important component of cities, and it plays a crucial role in addressing various environmental issues (e.g., floods, pollutants, heat islands, etc.). Effective water management of UGI is essential to ensure its environmental and ecological benefits in the face of climate change. However, previous studies have not adequately investigated water management strategies for UGI under climate change scenarios. This study aims to estimate the current and future water requirement and effective rainfall (rainwater stored in the soil and plant roots available for plant evapotranspiration) to determine the irrigation requirement of UGI during periods of rainfall deficit under current and future climate conditions. The results indicate that the water requirement for UGI will continue to increase under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, with a larger increase projected under RCP8.5. For instance, the average annual water requirement for UGI in Seoul, South Korea is currently 731.29 mm, and it is projected to increase to 756.45 mm (RCP4.5) and 816.47 mm (RCP8.5) during the period of 2081-2100, assuming low managed water stress condition. In addition, the water requirement of UGI in Seoul is the highest in June (approximately 125-137 mm) and the lowest in December or January (about 5-7mm). While irrigation is unnecessary in July and August due to sufficient rainfall, other months in Seoul require irrigation when rainfall is insufficient. For example, continuous insufficient rainfall from May to June 2100 and April to June 2081 would need >110 mm (RCP4.5) of irrigation requirement even under high managed water stress condition. The findings of this study provide a theoretical foundation for water management strategies in current and future UGI settings.

They contribute to nearly 40% of the GDP and provide a large variety of ecosystem services to the local populations. However, the sustainability of agricultural and agroforestry systems in these countries is gradually jeopardised by climate change since these ecosystems are still predominantly rain-fed and therefore at the mercy of climatic hazards. For a developing country like Benin, there is still a lot of data gap in other to quantify the impact of climate change on agro-ecosystems. Thus, the current study focused on providing an inventory of the evolution and the monetary value of agro-ecosystem services in Benin with an analysis of the perceptions of the impact of climate change on these services. The data analysed showed, from 1975 to 2015, a reduction in forests and savannahs in favour of an increase in cultivated land. The areas of water bodies, swamps and floodplains have increased by almost 500% in the subequatorial climate regions and have remained almost unchanged in the tropical climate regions. The main uses of agroecosystems were agriculture, fishing, energy production, timber trade, and cultural rituals. A monetary estimate reveals that the value of agroecosystems services provided in the subequatorial regions (USD 3700/ha) is 2-3 times greater than that of the value of these services in the tropical regions (USD 1600/ha). The local population didn't perceive see climate hazards as a threat to community forests and planted forests. However, they felt that the establishment of sustainable management of agroecosystems through good agricul-tural practices and sustainable management of the landscape, would allow better regulation of the climate, conservation of specific and genetic biodiversity, and solve the problems of erosion and silting up of rivers.

J	Panwar, S				Panwar, Sugandha			Vulnerability of Himalayan springs to climate change and anthropogenic impact: a review	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Review						Himalayan springs; Climate Change; Land use land cover changes; Spring management	LAND-USE CHANGES; GROUNDWATER QUALITY; WATER-RESOURCES; KASHMIR; KUMAUN; RIVER; HYDROLOGY; RAINFALL; AQUIFER; STORAGE	The climate change and unsustainable anthropogenic modification can intensify the vulnerability of the Himalayas. Natural springs are the principal source of potable water security for the Himalayan population. The changes in the trend of precipitation, temperature and glacier melt are expected to impact the quantity and quality of spring water significantly. This review presents an insight to unravel the effects of climate change and land use land cover changes on the spring resources and outline the essential elements of spring hydrology in the Himalayas. The sensitive response of spring flow to the climate has been observed to follows an annual periodic pattern strongly dependent on snowmelt, rainfall, and evapotranspiration. Among all types, Karst aquifers were found to be highly vulnerable. The changes in the forest and urban landscapes are affecting the recharging sites in the headwater region. In the Central Himalayan region (Kosi River basin, Kumaun), the number of perennial springs is decreasing at a rate of three springs year(-1), and non-perennial springs are increasing at the rate of one spring year(-1). The high concentration of NO3-, Cl-1, SO42-, and coliform counts reported from the spring water evidence a high susceptibility of shallow aquifers to the non-point source of pollution. Future projections indicate high surface-runoff and occurrence of extreme events such as floods, glacial lake outbursts, and landslides can affect the flow and water quality of springs. As the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities are expected to increase with time remarkably, there is an urgent need to promote regional scientific studies on springs targeting hydrogeochemical evolution, vulnerability assessment, recharge area dynamics, and development of springshed management program.

Multiple studies show that climate change will worsen the impacts of soil erosion in various regions. However, these studies are limited by (1) the lack of any thorough evaluation process in applying climate scenarios to drive soil erosion models, and (2) the failure to consider the role of changing land use under future climate change, despite the evidence that it is more important than rainfall changes in driving increased erosion. Using the WEPP soil erosion model, these methodological gaps are addressed in this study for a small catchment in Belgium that is both heavily impacted by soil erosion and boasting an extensive array of mitigation measures. We develop a novel and comprehensive methodology to rigorously and efficiently select suitable climate models specifically for simulating soil erosion by water, and examine the impact of a range of environmentally and economically viable land use choices on soil erosion. The main findings reveal that our climate model selection methodology is successful in generating the widest range of likely future scenarios from a small number of models, compared with other selection methods. Our novel methodology reveals that the magnitude and frequency of soil erosion events will increase considerably under the mean of all scenarios between 2041 and 2100 with existing land management. Winter wheat represents the most economically and environmentally viable land use choice to effectively mitigate future soil erosion when compared to other land use alternatives under the full range of likely future climate scenarios. This research illuminates the importance of carefully tuned climate model selection and land use changes for modelling future soil erosion by water so the best- and worst-case scenarios can be adequately prepared for under a changing climate.

Natural hazards may have severe implications for human life and can potentially generate economic losses and damage ecosystems. A better understanding of their major causes, probability of occurrence, and consequences enables society to be better prepared to save human lives as well as to invest in adaptation options. Natural hazards related to climate change are identified as one of the Grand Challenges in the Baltic Sea region. Here, we summarize existing knowledge about extreme events in the Baltic Sea region with a focus on the past 200 years as well as on future climate scenarios. The events considered here are the major hydro-meteorological events in the region and include wind storms, extreme waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation, sea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, and drought. We also address some ecological extremes and the implications of extreme events for society (phytoplankton blooms, forest fires, coastal flooding, offshore infrastructure, and shipping). Significant knowledge gaps are identified, including the response of large-scale atmospheric circulation to climate change and also concerning specific events, for example, the occurrence of marine heat waves and small-scale variability in precipitation. Suggestions for future research include the further development of high-resolution Earth system models and the potential use of methodologies for data analysis (statistical methods and machine learning). With respect to the expected impacts of climate change, changes are expected for sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves and phytoplankton blooms (increase), and cold spells and severe ice winters (decrease). For some extremes (drying, river flooding, and extreme waves), the change depends on the area and time period studied.

Impacts of climate change on the tourism sector of a Small Island Developing State: A case study for the Bahamas	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate change impact; Hurricanes; Tourism; Sea level rise; Small Island Developing States (SIDS)	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; VULNERABILITY; ASTER; ALOS; SRTM; DEMS	This study examines the direct and indirect impacts of climate change to the tourism sector on the islands of New Providence and adjacent Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The assessment was carried out by conducting a geospatial analysis of tourism establishments at risk using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We combined the geospatial analysis with publicly available databases to assess the integrated climate-related impacts pertaining to a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) economy. Our study estimated that many tourism properties currently lie in a storm surge zone and the extent of properties at risk increases with a future scenario of a 1 m rise in sea level. While sea level rise (SLR) by itself only threatens a small number of properties, when combined with weak (Category 1), moderate (Category 3) and strong (Category 5) storms the resulting coastal flooding impacts 34%, 69%, and 83% of the tourism infrastructure (hotels and resorts), respectively. In addition to flooding, properties are also susceptible to coastal erosion with 28% of the total hotels and resorts on the two islands being situated within 0-50 m and 60% of the tourism infrastructure within 0-100 m of the coastline. Considering the economic importance of the sector, the potential impacts on the tourism infrastructure will cause significant losses in revenue and employment for the two islands. Furthermore, the majority of the tourism on these islands is beach-based and visitor expenditures will decline due to their vulnerability. These losses will have far-reaching social-economic consequences for the Bahamas. Our findings reveal a need for integrated coastal zone management that incorporates tourism management strategies with adaptation measures to deal with climate change.

Climate change can increase existing vulnerabilities and deepen socioeconomic imbalances. Measures to reduce and adapt to the effects of climate change are needed in the livestock sector, as they can help reduce the damage caused by natural disasters and other effects of climate change. The future effects of climate change are a significant challenge for livestock managers, users of livestock products and other players, as they may face a number of problems, such as the qualitative and quantitative decline in cereals (feedstock), depletion of conventional sources of energy that provide the electricity and heat needed for animal husbandry, damage to animal shelters, changes in flood frequency and the effects of flooding on the process of spreading manure on land and unforeseen operating and maintenance costs. The adaptation of the intensive animal husbandry process to climate change is a complex process considering the variability of effects, physical vulnerability, degree of socioeconomic development of the entire analyzed area, natural adaptability, health services and disaster surveillance mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to help local authorities in the process of preparing for this transition in a way that takes into account not only socioeconomic factors but also the development constraints imposed by climate change. The studied area, Ciumeghiu-Avram Iancu, located in the southern part of Bihor County, Romania, has been designated as a disadvantaged area of socioeconomic development so that economic agents can apply for the financing of rural development projects with co-financing from European funds (up to 90%). The study presents an analysis of economic development (zootechnical activities) in the southern part of Bihor County, Romania in relation to the climatic vulnerability of the area. Knowing the changes induced in an area by climate change is still a challenge for any local community, and for a socioeconomically vulnerable area, such as the study area, it is important to have at hand studies that can indicate the directions and constraints of development in dictated by these changes. Through this study, we aimed to identify a correlation between the changes induced by climate change and the development capacity of livestock farms, as many economic agents have developed or are developing technical projects for the construction of animal farms in this area. This study is based on the requirements of European reference documents, standards and guidelines. Based on the data available at this time, the applied risk analysis methodology identified a moderate risk associated with increasing extreme temperatures, changes in average precipitation, increasing average temperature, availability of water/drought resources, floods, desertification and risks associated with soil erosion, and the risk of vegetation fires. The correlation of all these factors led us to the conclusion that the area allows for the strictly controlled development of new livestock farms based on plans for the development of territorial units in the area. These units must include desertified areas and define the areas for planting vegetal curtains that will both reduce the phenomenon of erosion and block the circulation of air masses with odor released from the activity of animal husbandry and manure management. The results of the analysis show that it is necessary to take into account the diverse nature of environmental evolution/climate change in different areas of economic development specific to a development area.

J	Ahmad, D; Afzal, M				Ahmad, Dilshad; Afzal, Muhammad			Flood hazards and agricultural production risks management practices in flood-prone areas of Punjab, Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Erratic rains; Flood hazards; Risk perception; Risk management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIMULTANEOUS ADOPTION; SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; ADAPTATION; ATTITUDES; FARMERS; PERCEPTIONS; MITIGATION; IMPACTS	Climate induced disasters, more specifically floods, have caused severe damage to the agriculture sector in Pakistan. These climatic risks have constrained the farming community to adopt risk management strategies to overcome such climate change risks. This research work attempted to examine the association of risk management tools with farmers' perception of risk, risk averse attitude, and various socioeconomic factors. The study has employed the sample data of 398 farmers from two high-risk flood-prone districts of Punjab, Pakistan. The multivariate probit model was used in this study to investigate the association of dependent and independent variables. The findings of the study indicated that small farmers consider heavy rains and floods severe risks to their agricultural production and are more risk averse than large farmers. Estimates of a multivariate probit model interpreted as age of farmer (0.036), heavy rains risk perception (0.597), and landholding size (0.114) were positively related with the risk management tool of depletion of assets. Farmers' education (0.056), off-farm income (3.47), age (0.018), and risk averse attitude of farmer (0.687) were positive, whereas experience of farming (-0.037) was negatively linked with reduction of consumption. Furthermore, experience of farming (0.005), risk averse attitude (0.493), heavy rains (0.481), and flood risk perception (0.536) were positively related with diversification adoption. The flood-prone farming community is more vulnerable to these climatic risks and rely on traditional strategies for risk management. There is a need to adopt crop diversification based on developing research capacity for innovative crop varieties having resistance to floods and climate change affects. Some significant policy measures, such as a more resilient scenario of climate change and floods, need to stimulate activities of enterprise diversification, opportunities of diversifying employment, and strengthening activities of off-farm employment for the sound livelihood of flood-prone farmers and to minimize severe affects of climatic risks.

Model cascade from meteorological drivers to river flood hazard: flood-cascade v1.0	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; UNGAUGED BASINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; RISK; IMPACT; REGIONALIZATION; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; SATELLITE	Riverine flood hazard is the consequence of meteorological drivers, primarily precipitation, hydrological processes and the interaction of floodwaters with the floodplain landscape. Modeling this can be particularly challenging because of the multiple steps and differing spatial scales involved in the varying processes. As the climate modeling community increases their focus on the risks associated with climate change, it is important to translate the meteorological drivers into relevant hazard estimates. This is especially important for the climate attribution and climate projection communities. Current climate change assessments of flood risk typically neglect key processes, and instead of explicitly modeling flood inundation, they commonly use precipitation or river flow as proxies for flood hazard. This is due to the complexity and uncertainties of model cascades and the computational cost of flood inundation modeling. Here, we lay out a clear methodology for taking meteorological drivers, e.g., from observations or climate models, through to high-resolution (similar to 90 m) river flooding (fluvial) hazards. Thus, this framework is designed to be an accessible, computationally efficient tool using freely available data to enable greater uptake of this type of modeling. The meteorological inputs (precipitation and air temperature) are transformed through a series of modeling steps to yield, in turn, surface runoff, river flow, and flood inundation. We explore uncertainties at different modeling steps. The flood inundation estimates can then be related to impacts felt at community and household levels to determine exposure and risks from flood events. The approach uses global data sets and thus can be applied anywhere in the world, but we use the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh as a case study in order to demonstrate the necessary steps in our hazard framework. This framework is designed to be driven by meteorology from observational data sets or climate model output. In this study, only observations are used to drive the models, so climate changes are not assessed. However, by comparing current and future simulated climates, this framework can also be used to assess impacts of climate change.

The first objective of this study conducted on the middle Lena was to analyze the island dynamics for the last 50 years (1967 to 2017). Several morphological parameters were surveyed using a GIS on seven series of aerial photographs and satellite images of a 100 km-long reach: island size, eroded and deposited areas, position and morphology of the islands. This approach enabled the identification of evolutionary models. Our second objective was to evaluate the potential impact of ongoing climate change. We analyzed morphological parameters with respect to two main factors: efficient discharge (bar-full, bankfull and flood discharges) and water temperature. A potential erosion index (PEI) was calculated by coupling the duration of discharge exceeding the bar-full level and water temperature. The results identified several morphological changes that occurred at the end of the 20th century: an increase in the number of islands, greater eroded surfaces and accelerated migration of islands. Comparing the dynamics of islands with and without permafrost is a good indicator of their sensitivity to climate change. A major change was observed concerning the erosion and migration of islands with and without permafrost. This evolution seems to & nbsp;be linked both with the duration of the discharge that exceeds the bar-full level and with the number of flood peaks. The water temperature in May and August have a major influence on permafrost islands that become in-creasingly destabilized. Thus, as large rivers are assumed to slowly react to climate change, the recent changes in the Lena River prove that the global change deeply impacts periglacial rivers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigate the impact of precipitation change on European average winter and summer financial losses due to flooding under a 1.5 degrees C warming scenario (reflecting a projected climate in the year 2115 according to RCP2.6) and for a counterfactual current-climate scenario where the climate has evolved without anthropogenic influence (reflecting a climate corresponding to pre-industrial conditions). Climate scenarios were generated with the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) version 5. For each scenario, we derive a set of weights that when applied to the current climate's precipitation results in a climatology that approximates that of the scenario. We apply the weights to annual losses from a well-calibrated (to the current climate) flood loss model that spans 50,000 years and re-compute the average annual loss to assess the impact of precipitation changes induced by anthropogenic climate change. The method relies on a large stochastic set of physically based flood model simulations and allows quick assessment of potential loss changes due to change in precipitation based on two statistics, namely total precipitation, and total precipitation of very wet days (defined here as the total precipitation of days above the 95th percentile of daily precipitation). We compute the statistics with the raw CAM precipitation and bias-corrected precipitation. Our results show that for both raw and bias-corrected statistics i) average flood loss in Europe generally tend to increase in winter and decrease in summer for the future scenario, and consistent with that change we also show that ii) average flood losses have increased (decreased) for winter (summer) from pre-industrial conditions to the current day. The magnitude of the change varies among scenarios and statistics chosen.

Whereas some approaches to adaptation education are consistent with EE foundational principles, others, while crucial for individual survival, address more immediate risks in ways that do not promote longer-term environmental quality. Using a literature review, we examine issues climate adaptation education raises for the field of EE. We then describe example programs that integrate climate mitigation and adaptation, drawing from EE programs in New York City following devastating floods brought about by Hurricane Sandy. These programs are consistent with a praxis or action research approach to EE where learning is embedded in restoration and other forms of action. We close with reflections on how EE might address climate change adaptation in a manner consistent with climate mitigation education and with our field's focus on improving environmental quality.

Besides thermal effects, warming also drives important ancillary environmental changes, such as when river hydrology evolves in response to climate forcing. Earlier snowmelt runoff and summer flow declines are broadly manifested in snow-dependent regions and relevant to socioeconomically important cold-water fishes. Here, we mechanistically quantify how climate-induced summer flow declines during historical and future periods cause complex local changes in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) habitats for juveniles and spawning adults. Changes consisted of large reductions in useable habitat area and connectivity between the main channel and adjacent off-channel habitats. These reductions decrease the capacity of freshwater habitats to support historical salmon abundances and could pose risks to population persistence in some areas.

Indigenous populations, tourism investors, ecosystems, and geodiversity suffer from the consequences of increasing temperature during the summer season and flooding in the winter season. Since most of the oases, ecosystems, and populations are located in valleys, we identify management challenges that are likely to arise to shed light on managerial decision-making that will be required. Rural tourism is practically the only activity promoting income in such a territory. The management of natural and cultural heritage products, within a conceptual framework of protection, has proven to be necessary. The best proposal at the moment is the creation of a Global Geopark, offering policies and management plans for conservation.

Here we use station data and high-resolution simulations from the WRF convection permitting climate model (similar to 4 km, 1 h) over the US to assess future changes in hourly precipitation extremes. It is demonstrated that hourly precipitation extremes and storm depths are expected to intensify under climate change and what is now a 20-year rainfall will become a 7-year rainfall on average for similar to 75% of gridpoints over the US. This intensification is mostly expressed as an increase in rainfall tail heaviness. Statistically significant changes in the seasonality and duration of rainfall extremes are also exhibited over similar to 95% of the domain. Our results suggest more non-linear future precipitation extremes with shorter spell duration that are distributed more uniformly throughout the year.

To address CFW knowledge gaps in south-east Queensland, Australia, we surveyed the floristic composition and structure of wooded CFWs and explored variation in vegetation patterns in relation to selected environmental drivers. Understorey and shrub assemblages were surveyed using a cover-class scale and stem counts for tree species abundance. Vegetation structure attributes (stem density, basal area) were calculated from survey data. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate drivers of vegetation structure and the species composition of each stratum. Vegetation structure patterns were associated with gradients of rainfall, soil moisture, salinity and pH. Understorey species composition was associated with wallum wetland species, native perennial grass and herb species, and vegetation patterns of the canopy. Common CFW species, namely Melaleuca quinquenervia and Eucalyptus tereticornis, dominated tree assemblage variation. Overall, CFW vegetation exhibited strong associations with gradients of salinity, rainfall, groundwater dependence and disturbance. Alterations to key drivers of vegetation pattern with future climate changes are likely to markedly influence the composition, structure and function of CFW vegetation communities. Action is therefore required to maintain CFW vegetation communities and ecological function in these diverse and unique wetland systems.

Many regions, like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), lack key baseline evidence. We present initial results from a climate change threat assessment of MENA's coastal heritage using the Maritime Endangered Archaeology inventory: a geospatial database of MENA maritime archaeological sites incorporating a disturbance/ threat assessment. It informs two analyses of past disturbance and future threat: (1) using the integral threat/disturbance assessment, and (2) geospatial extraction of information from external coastal change models. Analysis suggests <5% of documented coastal sites are definitely affected by coastal erosion but up to 34% could also have experienced past flooding, erosion, or storm action. Climate change-related threats will increase over the 21st Century and accelerate post-2050 if carbon emissions remain high. SLR and ESL could impact 14-25% of sites by 2050 and 18-34% by 2100. Over 30% to 40% of sites could be impacted by erosion by 2050 and 2100 respectively. Whilst documentation is ongoing and there remain modeling uncertainties, this approach provides a means to redress the absence of baseline data on climate change threats to coastal cultural heritage in MENA .

This study quantitatively researched in-depth information on climate change in Jiangxi using the up-to-date "ground truth" precipitation and temperature data, the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE, 1961-2015, 0.25 degrees) data; analyzed the connections between ENSO and climate factors (including precipitation and temperature); and discussed the relationships between the ENSO and climate change. The main findings of this study were (1) during the period of 1961-2015, annual precipitation and temperature generally increased at a rate of 2.68 mm/year and 0.16 degrees C/10a, respectively; (2) the precipitation temporal trends have significant spatial differences. For example, the high precipitation increasing rates occurred in northern Jiangxi province in summer, while the large decreasing rates happened in most regions of Jiangxi province in spring; (3) an abrupt temperature change was detected around 1984, with general decreasing trends and increasing trends in 1961-1984 and 1984-2015, respectively; (4) ENSO had significant impacts on precipitation changes over Jiangxi province, for example; the El Nino events, beginning in April and May, were likely to enlarge the amounts of precipitation in the following summer, and the El Nino events beginning in October were likely to enlarge the precipitation amounts in the following spring and summer; and (5) the El Nino events, starting in the second half of the year, were likely to raise the temperature in the winter and the following spring. These findings would provide valuable information for better understanding the climate change issues over Jiangxi province.

The study of lightning activity on long temporal periods is crucial for fields related to atmospheric phenomena from intense rain-related hazard processes to long-term climate changes. This study focuses on 19 years of lightning-activity data, recorded from Italian Lightning Detection Network SIRF, part of the European network EUCLID (European Cooperation for Lightning Detection). Preliminary analysis was dedicated to the spatial and temporal assessment of lightning through detection in the Central Mediterranean area, focusing on yearly and monthly data. Temporal and spatial features have been analyzed, measuring clustering through the application of global Moran's I statistics and spatial local autocorrelation; a Mann-Kendall trend test was performed on monthly series aggregating the original data on a 5 x 5 km cell. A local statistically significant trend emerged from the analysis, suggesting possible linkage between surface warming and lightning activity.

The study presents a demand-driven approach to specify the impacts of regional climate change on agriculture, viticulture, and fruit and vegetable growing in Lower Franconia, southern Germany, a region with heterogeneous topography, diversified land use patterns, and intense activities in the sectors specified above. The approach is based on an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model projections, a bias correction tool, and a large spectrum of meteorological (extreme) indicators that are crucial to the agricultural sector in Central Europe, as inferred from a stakeholder survey.For several decades, Lower Franconia represents a hotspot region of climate change with enhanced heat waves, prolonged droughts, and intermittent local flooding by heavy rainfall events. Results of the high-resolution regional climate model projections indicate an increase of hot days and tropical nights by a factor of 5 and 12, respectively, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow until 2100 according to the RCP8.5 emission scenario. At the same time, droughts will occur more frequently and last longer while rainfall intensity enhances. A longer growing period starting more than 40 days earlier (compared to the reference period 1970 to 1999) implies a higher risk of late frost damage for crops, fruits, grapes, and even some tree species. In contrast, the thermal prerequisites for viticulture will be satisfied across the entire region, even at higher-elevation sites. These facets of regional climate change are made accessible to users and the public via an interactive field-resolving web portal. Altogether, they gravely challenge the historically developed land use systems in Lower Franconia and require timely adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Although numerous projections have been proposed and developed for evaluating the climate change impacts, most models suffer from significant bias error due to the coarse resolution of the climate datasets, which affects the accuracy of the climate change assessment. Therefore, in this study, post-processing techniques (interpolation and bias correction methods) were adopted on the database for Policy Decision Making for Future Climate Change (d4PDF) model for extreme climatic flood events simulation in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand, under + 4-K future climate simulation. Due to the limited number of the rain gages, the gradient plus inverse distance squared interpolation method (combination of multiple linear regression and distance weighting methods) was applied in this study. In the bias correction methods, the additional setting of monthly and seasonal periods was adjusted. The proposed bias correction approach deployed gamma distribution combined with generalized Pareto distribution setting with the seasonal period for the rainy season datasets, whereas only the gamma setting was applied with the monthly period during the dry season. The outcomes revealed that the proposed method could react to extreme rainfall events, expand dry days during dry season, and intensify rainfall amount during rainy season. The post-processing d4PDF trends of six sea surface temperature (SST) patterns (consists of 90 ensemble members) of two periods (near future: 2051-2070 and far future: 2091-2110) recorded the highest and lowest amounts of annual rainfalls of 4,450 mm/year in mid-stream of Nan River and 710 mm/year in the lower CPRB, respectively. Notably, the significant variances noted in the rainfall patterns among ensembles, demanding further investigation in future climate change, impact studies. The findings of the study provided novel insights on the importance of proper post-processing techniques for improving the robustness of d4PDF in climate change impacts assessment.

In Vietnam, clam farming has often encountered massive clam mortalities and the main reasons for that are weather-related extreme events. This study, therefore, aims to assess risks and then propose mitigation solutions for clam farms in Northern Vietnam in the context of climate change. Five categories of risks for clam farms were identified and categorized, including (i) physical risks of nature, (ii) operational and technical risks, (iii) financial and market-related risks, (iv) social and political risks (v) liability and consumer-related risks. Each risk type was assessed for probability and consequence on a 5-point scale. A risk matrix was used to define the level of risk as negligible, low, moderate, high or extreme. Results showed that clam farms in Northern Vietnam were at high or extreme risk from tropical cyclones and floods, severe temperature and salinity, environmental pollutants, infectious diseases and predators. The other risks ranged from negligible to moderate, except for the low quality of seeds, high stocking densities and unstable markets defined as high risk at some farms. Remarkable physical risks of nature detected in the present study indicate that greater awareness of risk management for clam farming is required if this activity is to be sustainable under climate change.

J	Yang, YC; Ge, YE				Yang, Yi-Chih; Ge, Ying-En			Adaptation strategies for port infrastructure and facilities under climate change at the Kaohsiung port	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Sea port; Vulnerability analysis; Adaptation strategy; Climate change	IMPACT; RISK	The growing impact of climate change on port infrastructure and facilities currently may lead to a rising frequency of such serious natural disasters or accidents as rising sea level, increasing extreme weather, increasing intensity of tropical storms and typhoons, rising wave height surmounting breakwater design levels, heavy rain exceeding quay well drainage capacity, rising ocean temperatures, and deteriorating harbor water quality. The paper aims to apply a risk management matrix approach to vulnerability assessment and identification of desirable adaptation strategies. The data for this investigation is first collected by means of questionnaire survey of experts in shipping companies or port management offices at the Kaohsiung port. Then, a vulnerability analysis of port infrastructure and facilities is carried out under the impact of severe typhoons. Subsequently, adaptation strategies are identified for infrastructure and facilities at the Kaohsiung port to address the adverse impacts of climate change. One intellectual merit of this paper is that ten vulnerability assessment criteria are proposed for addressing the impacts of climate change on port infrastructure and facilities. Second, both ground and access roads in the port area, and drainage facilities in flooding-prone areas are shown to be damaged in the moderate risk areas potentially impacted by typhoons. The third merit is that a set of adaptation strategies has been identified for the moderate risk areas impacted by serious typhoons.

This paper examines the urban poor's perceptions and vulnerability to climate change in Kampala. Data was collected from a proportionate sample of 534 respondents drawn from households that were randomly selected from the city's informal settlements and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Six focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews were conducted whose participants were purposively selected because of their knowledge and experiences. Quantitative data was analyzed using chi-square tests while content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A total of 96.6% of the households were aware of climate change, mainly perceived as rising temperatures and reduction in rainfall. Floods (53.4%) and droughts (27%) were the most commonly experienced climate risks, with the former considered more frequent and severe. Perceptions and vulnerability to climate risk varied with incomes, education level, marital status, main occupation, housing conditions and length of stay. Individuals with less wealth and education, employed in informal business and having insecure housing tenure were most vulnerable to flooding than they are to drought. The sensitivity of the urban poor communities is heightened by ecosystem degradation, poor access to urban infrastructure, utilities and services. With socio-economic attributes highly associated to climate change vulnerabilities, incorporating social dimensions and exchange of information between the vulnerable communities, planners and decision makers is necessary to inform the city's adaptation policy and building long-term urban resilience. Partnerships are necessary between the urban authorities, communities, civil society and donors/financiers to improve housing and livelihoods in slums settlements. At the same time, strengthening co-production of climate information services, building climate change awareness, restoration of critical ecosystems and a broader inclusive adaptation planning are avenues for building resilient urban poor communities.

The river flow, although remains relatively unregulated, is expected to be increasingly perturbed by climate change and rapidly accelerating socioeconomic developments. Current understanding about hydrological changes under the combined impacts of these drivers, however, remains limited. This study presents projected hydrological changes caused by multiple drivers, namely climate change, large-scale hydropower developments, and irrigated land expansions by 2050s. We found that the future flow regime is highly susceptible to all considered drivers, shown by substantial changes in both annual and seasonal flow distribution. While hydropower developments exhibit limited impacts on annual total flows, climate change and irrigation expansions cause changes of +15% and -3% in annual flows, respectively. However, hydropower developments show the largest seasonal impacts characterized by higher dry season flows (up to +70%) and lower wet season flows (-15%). These strong seasonal impacts tend to outplay those of the other drivers, resulting in the overall hydrological change pattern of strong increases of the dry season flow (up to + 160%); flow reduction in the first half of the wet season (up to -25%); and slight flow increase in the second half of the wet season (up to 40%). Furthermore, the cumulative impacts of all drivers cause substantial flow reductions during the early wet season (up to -25% in July), posing challenges for crop production and saltwater intrusion in the downstream Mekong Delta. Substantial flow changes and their consequences require careful considerations of future development activities, as well as timely adaptation to future changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Based on ethnoecological fieldwork, in this paper we examine how people living in the cuvette centrale of the Congo basin have adopted flood-recession agriculture on islands in the Congo River, taking advantage of a secular shift since the 1980s in the hydrological regime of the Congo River. Analyses of the hydrological data reveal that this shift decreased flood risk and significantly extended the growing season on the islands, long enough to enable cultivation of fast-maturing varieties of manioc and other crops. Flood-recession farming on islands in the river is today not only an important source of food, but also a source of income for women, who are primarily responsible for seasonal cultivation of fields during the low-water season. Hydrological changes alone are insufficient to explain the adoption of the new agricultural practice; adoption also arose as a result of dynamic interactions among river fishing, trading, and broader socio-economic forces. Climate-change models project an increased frequency of extreme floods. Our results suggest that this change may limit island cultivation in the future. More generally, our findings point to the importance of looking beyond single-factor, solely environmental explanations in studies of climate-change adaptation.

Therefore, to stimulate effective basin management, we investigated the trends in temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and water availability under 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming levels across the transboundary Teesta river basin. The ensemble median of five bias-corrected model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) was used for this purpose. The results indicate that the temperature is expected to significantly increase (decrease) in the near (far) future, along with an overall significant increasing trend in monsoon precipitation. The evaporation paradox is found in the near future, and the water availability is likely to increase, with some exceptions for the pre-monsoon season. The perpetuation of such changes might result in environmental degradation through snow melting, glacial recession, and floods. Anticipating the changing climatic scenarios and their possible impacts, in this study, we recommend a variety of short- and long-term strategies for the concerned stakeholders to implement the Sustainable Development Goal 13, i.e., "Climate Action", over the Teesta river basin.

This study focuses on two vital crops in China-maize and rice-and provides a comprehensive analysis of how these crops are affected by climate change-induced factors over the periods 1978Q1-2015Q4. Four key findings were obtained. First, using a nonparametric approach to estimate actual and observed trends of climatic variables, the results show a significant positive trend in average temperature from February to October. On the other hand, seasonal temperature increases during spring, summer, and autumn. Second, the results show no significant change in the monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall patterns when examined over the study period. Third, using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, we find that while temperature and rainfall do not significantly support rice production in the long and short run, they play a substantial role in maize production in China. Finally, we find no significant difference in the results for rice when the quantile regression (QR) technique that controls for distributional asymmetry effects is employed. However, the impact of temperature on maize decreases at higher quantiles. Given the outcomes of our study, we argue that an advanced irrigation system is crucial and must be encouraged to minimize the effects of climate change on crop production.

This need is recognised by the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which emphasises the importance of preparing for the disasters that our world may face tomorrow through strategies/policies that aim to minimise uncontrolled development in hazardous areas. While the vast majority of natural-hazard risk-assessment frameworks have so far focused on static impacts associated with current conditions and/or are influenced by historical context, some authors have sought to provide decision makers with risk-quantification approaches that can be used to cultivate a sustainable future. This Review documents these latter efforts, explicitly examining work that has modelled and quantified the individual components that comprise tomorrow's risk, i.e., future natural hazards affected by climate change, future exposure (e.g., in terms of population, land use, and the built environment), and the evolving physical vulnerabilities of the world's infrastructure. We end with a discussion on the challenges faced by modellers in determining the risks that tomorrow's world may face from natural hazards, and the constraints these place on the decision-making abilities of relevant stakeholders.

Study focus: Hydro-climatic extremes analysis for historical (1971-2015) and future (2024-2100) period. New hydrological insights for the region: Remarkable climate change has been observed in high mountain areas, which may result in more frequent hydro-climatic extremes. Investigating hydroclimatic extremes variations is important for mitigating hydro-climatic disasters and implementing water resource management. Warm extremes present an increasing trend in frequency and magnitude for historical and future period, while the cold extremes show a decreasing trend in the study area. Meanwhile, frequency and amount of precipitation extremes present an increasing trend for historical and future period. As a result, the intensity of meteorological and hydrological droughts show decreasing trends while floods present an increasing trend, indicating a certain drought relief in the study area. But future occurrence of extreme droughts or floods will increase. Moreover, floods for different return periods will rise with different change rate under different scenarios (SSP 1-2.6, SSP 2-4.5, SSP 3-7.0 and SSP 5-8.5). Therefore, extreme floods or droughts risks should not be underestimated and need be addressed accordingly. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive strategies to cope with more frequent hydro-climatic extremes under climate change.

This often requires accounting for the effect of climate change due to evidence of its effect on extreme precipitation. There is a large number of approaches for IDF curve estimation under climate change in the literature; however, a general framework with practical guidelines for facilitating their application by practitioners is not readily available. The aim of the present study is to provide practical guidelines and recommendations for helping federal and provincial agencies, as well as others who might produce practice guidelines, to develop standardized procedures for the estimation of future IDF curves in Canada that can then be used by practitioners in infrastructure design, management and risk assessment. This is done by gathering and summarizing findings in rainfall frequency analysis from the Canadian FloodNet Research Group, under a practically oriented perspective. Technical recommendations are presented within a methodological framework to facilitate understanding; decision-making procedure-specific flowcharts are provided to facilitate their application. The proposed methodological framework is based on the use of pooled frequency analysis for reasonable estimation of extreme rainfall intensities, and on the estimation of gridded relative changes for IDF updates under climate change following different approaches depending on rain gauge network density. In particular, three methods that do not compete against each other but rather are different methodologies to be applied depending on the case study are proposed: pooled estimation of extreme rainfall in Canada (Method I), gridded relative changes in 24-h extreme rainfall intensities in Canada (Method II) and gridded relative changes in 24-h and sub-daily extreme rainfall intensities in regions of Canada with a relatively high station density (Method III).

J	Vij, S; Biesbroek, R; Adler, C; Muccione, V				Vij, Sumit; Biesbroek, Robbert; Adler, Carolina; Muccione, Veruska			Climate Change Adaptation in European Mountain Systems: A Systematic Mapping of Academic Research	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						climate change; mountains; adaptation options; systematic literature review; Europe	EASTERN-EUROPE; DYNAMICS; PYRENEES; TRENDS; MAP	European mountain regions have already been impacted by climate change, and this is projected to increase in the future. These mountain regions experience rapid changes, which influence social-ecological systems in the lower-mountain and floodplain regions of Europe. There is scattered evidence across different strands of academic literature on the ways in which the impacts of changing climate in mountain regions are addressed and adaptive capacity is enhanced. Using a systematic mapping review, we mapped English-language scientific journal articles that analyzed the climate change adaptation options that are planned or implemented in European mountain regions. Our understanding of how academic literature has investigated climate change adaptation is critical to identifying key knowledge gaps and research foci. Following the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research protocol, 72 scientific articles published between January 2011 and August 2019 were identified from a total of 702 scientific articles. Our findings show that existing academic literature has a strong focus on the western and southern European mountains: the European Alps (n = 24), Pyrenees (n = 11), and Sierra Nevada (n = 4). Key climate impacts reported for the biophysical systems include reduction in forest carbon, soil erosion, changes in vegetation patterns, and changes in plant population and tree heights; in human systems, these include water availability, agricultural production, changes in viticulture, and impacts on tourism. Key adaptation options reported in this article are wetland conservation options, changing cropping and cultivation cycles, tree species management strategies, and snow-making technology. We found very few articles analyzing governance responses to planning and implementing adaptation; these had a strong bias toward techno-managerial responses. We conclude that, while climate impacts are substantial in European mountain regions, there are knowledge gaps in academic literature that need to be addressed.

Rising air temperatures, increasing precipitation in winter, and decreasing precipitation in summer as well as increases in extreme weather events have increased flooding and droughts and further affected water quality in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with five downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) to quantify the impact of climate change on hydrology, soil erosion, nutrient cycling, and the performance of Best Management Practices (BMPs) at watershed scale, driven by RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Compared with the baseline scenario, the results indicated that climate variability, especially precipitation and temperature, had great effects on surface runoff, sediment yields, and nutrient losses and further significantly affected BMP efficiency, although the magnitudes of change differed among the RCPs. Monthly sediment and nutrient loads increased substantially in all climate change scenarios, especially in flood season, due to the increase in precipitation intensity. Although BMPs were identified to be not appreciably effective in controlling water balance, they were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses. Based on this case, a simulation-optimization framework was applied to develop future watershed management strategies with BMP configurations because of their climate adaptation benefits, water improvement targets, and economical cost. The results indicated that the discrepancy among different climate scenarios was reflected by the number and types of BMPs and their spatial distributions, especially structural BMPs. This study suggests that the increasing frequency of rainfall events may decrease the efficiency of BMPs in the MRW, and watershed management should be adjusted according to changing climate in the future.

Iestyn			Space-based Earth observation in support of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; Earth observation; Paris Agreement; enhanced transparency framework; mitigation; adaptation; loss and damage; global stocktake	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; METHANE; GAS; EMISSIONS; VULNERABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; CARBON; AGRICULTURE; SCIENCE	Space-based Earth observation (EO), in the form of long-term climate data records, has been crucial in the monitoring and quantification of slow changes in the climate system-from accumulating greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, increasing surface temperatures, and melting sea-ice, glaciers and ice sheets, to rising sea-level. In addition to documenting a changing climate, EO is needed for effective policy making, implementation and monitoring, and ultimately to measure progress and achievements towards the overarching goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement to combat climate change. The best approach for translating EO into actionable information for policymakers and other stakeholders is, however, far from clear. For example, climate change is now self-evident through increasingly intense and frequent extreme events-heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and flooding-costing human lives and significant economic damage, even though single events do not constitute "climate ". EO can capture and visualize the impacts of such events in single images, and thus help quantify and ultimately manage them within the framework of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, both at the national level (via the Enhanced Transparency Framework) and global level (via the Global Stocktake). We present a transdisciplinary perspective, across policy and science, and also theory and practice, that sheds light on the potential of EO to inform mitigation, including sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, and adaptation, including loss and damage. Yet to be successful with this new mandate, EO science must undergo a radical overhaul: it must become more user-oriented, collaborative, and transdisciplinary; span the range from fiducial to contextual data; and embrace new technologies for data analysis (e.g., artificial intelligence). Only this will allow the creation of the knowledge base and actionable climate information needed to guide the UNFCCC Paris Agreement to a just and equitable success.

Moreover, uncertain future climate, evolving socio-economic context, and stakeholders with conflicting interests, lead to a highly complex decision problem. Therefore, there is a need for decision support tools to objectively determine the value of investments, considering the impacts on different groups of actors, and the risks linked to uncertainties. We present a new open-source hydro-economic optimization model, incorporating in a holistic framework, representations of the water, agriculture, and power systems. The model represents the joint development of nexusrelated infrastructure and policies and evaluates their economic impact, as well as the risks linked to uncertainties in future climate and socio-economic development. We apply the methodology in the Zambezi River basin, a major African basin shared by eight countries, in which multiple investment opportunities exist, including new hydropower plants, new or resized reservoirs, development of irrigation agriculture, and investments into the power grid. We show that it is crucial to consider the links between the different systems when evaluating the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development, which will ultimately influence investment decisions. We find that climate change could induce economic losses of up to USD 2.3 billion per year in the current system. We show that the value of the hydropower development plan is sensitive to future fuel prices, carbon pricing policies, the capital cost of solar technologies, and climate change. Similarly, we show that the value of the irrigation development plan is sensitive to the evolution of crop yields, world market crop prices, and climate change. Finally, we evaluate the opportunity costs of restoring the natural floods in the Zambezi Delta; we find limited economic trade-offs under the current climate, but major trade-offs with irrigation and hydropower generation under the driest climate change scenario.

We trace the era of Indigenous governance (about the precolonial period), especially from about 1910 to the devastation of the flood in Dzawada'enuxw First Nation territory in Kingcome, British Columbia, in 2010. This time period has been chosen as the assessment period as this is the lifetime of the 10 Elders that we collaborated with to understand and position change during this tumultuous era. We call the results of this process "a century of knowledge". Ecological, social, and climate change are positioned with scientific literature for potential divergence/convergence. Almost all aspects of the Kwakwaka'wakw home area have undergone large-scale changes including clear-cut forestry, salmon farms, climate change affecting species ranges, cultural impositions, and colonial processes working to destroy Indigenous governance. Despite these imposed changes, the communities emerge as survivors on their own terms, including using the traditional feast system known as the Potlatch to come to terms with the devastation of the 2010 flood and beyond.

J	Osberghaus, D; Hünewaldt, V				Osberghaus, Daniel; Huenewaldt, Victoria			Neighborhood effects in climate change adaptation behavior: empirical evidence from Germany	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Neighborhood effects; Adaptation; Floods; Heat	MITIGATION MEASURES; ADOPTION; RISK; MOTIVATION; HOUSEHOLDS; PRIVATE; FAMILY	Frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as floods or heat waves, increase as a result of climate change. Therefore, it is important to investigate which factors might influence adaptation decisions at the household level. In this context, we examine whether adaptation behavior is related to adaptation decisions reported by neighboring households or to the perception that neighbors have implemented such measures. The empirical analysis is based on a large-scale household survey in Germany (4784 geo-located households) and multivariate regressions of different types of adaptation behavior: structural/behavioral flood and heat adaptation measures as well as the purchase of flood insurance for residential buildings and contents. We contribute to existing research inter alia by providing first insights on neighborhood effects regarding heat adaptation and by considering adaptation behavior as it is reported by neighbors, rather than as it is perceived by survey respondents. The results suggest positive neighborhood effects in the context of structural adaptation measures, but no effects on insurance purchase decisions. Neighborhood effects on flood adaptation are stronger for households without prior flood experience and depend on available household income. These findings show that individuals' climate adaptation behavior may be affected by the observed behavior of social peers. Therefore, neighborhood effects are important to be considered by policy-makers to strengthen private adaptation behavior.

J	Nakamura, R; Shimatani, Y				Nakamura, Ryota; Shimatani, Yukihiro			Extreme-flood control operation of dams in Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Extreme-flood control of dams; Excess flood; Adaptation strategies for climate change	RISK	Study region: Japan Study focus: In Japan, floods exceeding the flood control plan by dams have become more frequent in recent years. When such a flood occurs, the reservoir is operated to discharge the same amount of flood as the inflow, which is called "Extreme Flood Control Operations". Therefore, knowing the implementation of Extreme Flood Control Operations is equivalent to knowing the scale and frequency of extreme flood events in Japan. The number of Extreme Flood Control Operations is expected to increase due to climate change, which provides a current assessment of the impacts of climate change. New hydrological insights for the region: In Japan, the number of Extreme Flood Control Operations has been increasing between 1960 and 2019. However, the number of dams being built is increasing, and the number of Extreme Flood Control Operations per dam construction is decreasing. In more than one case (41 %) of the floods that were operated to prevent extreme floods, the capacity of the dam (the sum of the flood control capacity and the diversion capacity) was required to exceed the storage capacity of the dam. This means that there are some floods that cannot be handled by pre-flooding to ensure flood control capacity. Therefore, it is suggested that dams alone cannot cope with increasingly severe floods in the future.

J	Fayazi, M; Bisson, IA; Nicholas, E				Fayazi, Mahmood; Bisson, Isabelle-Anne; Nicholas, Eugene			Barriers to climate change adaptation in indigenous communities: A case study on the mohawk community of Kanesatake, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Political barriers; Institutional fragmentation; Indigenous community of Kanesatake; Canada	SEA-LEVEL RISE; VULNERABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; IPCC; FOOD	The switch from climate change mitigation to the adaptation to its impacts or effects initially appears to be a promising strategy. Academics and practitioners, however, confront limits and barriers to the adaptation both in theory and practice. Despite the extensive efforts in understanding limits and barriers, little is still known about political and institutional barriers, more specifically political challenges in Indigenous communities that typically nullify the effect of adaptation strategies. This study investigates the experience of the Mohawk community of Kanesatake, a First Nations community in Canada, during and after the 2017 and the 2019 floods in Quebec. Results reveal the links between the proximate set of barriers and historical, political pressures in Indigenous communities. Findings explain that unhealed wounds in relationships among nations generate political and institutional hurdles, which eventually orchestrate the co-occurrence of multiple barriers: the lack of land ownership rights, insurance, and social institutions such as police force and firefighters, to name a few. Findings have implications both for theory and practice. In theory, the findings reveal the fact that barriers are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are often interdependent. In practice, findings support the fact that policies fail if they disregard underlying interdependencies.

Drivers of future urban flood risk	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Review						urban flooding; flood foresight; extreme rainfall; climate change; source-pathway-receptor model; flood risk scenario modelling	VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT	Managing urban flood risk is a key global challenge of the twenty-first century. Drivers of future UK flood risk were identified and assessed by the Flood Foresight project in 2002-2004 and 2008; envisaging flood risk during the 2050s and 2080s under a range of scenarios for climate change and socio-economic development. This paper qualitatively reassesses and updates these drivers, using empirical evidence and advances in flood risk science, technology and practice gained since 2008. Of the original drivers, five have strengthened, three have weakened and 14 remain within their 2008 uncertainty bands. Rainfall, as impacted by climate change, is the leading source driver of future urban flood risk. Intra-urban asset deterioration, leading to increases in a range of consequential flood risks, is the primary pathway driver. Social impacts (risk to life and health, and the intangible impacts of flooding on communities) and continued capital investment in buildings and contents (leading to greater losses when newer buildings of higher economic worth are inundated) have strengthened as receptor drivers of urban flood risk. Further, we propose two new drivers: loss of floodable urban spaces and indirect economic impacts, which we suggest may have significant impacts on future urban flood risk. This article is part of the theme issue 'Urban flood resilience'.

While decision-makers struggle with climate uncertainty, an effective infrastructure adaptation strategy attaches great importance to preventing disasters resulting from rainfall. We propose a decision-making model to incorporate the probability of rainfall disasters and recommend investing time when evaluating projects related to climate adaptation. We use a hydrological statistical model and economic and technical factors to estimate the expected economic losses in several rainfall disaster scenarios, and the value of the adaptation infrastructures is calculated using a real options pricing approach. Then the decision-making model is applied to a case study involving a campus rainfall disaster prevention facility at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, China. We established three submerged scenarios with different rainfall intensities, then we evaluated the premium of holding an option to defer and pointed out the optimal investing time in each scenario. This model is expected to provide guidance for the development of adaptation infrastructure for relatively small areas such as communities and universities. And we proved that using real options-based approach could provide more managerial flexibility for investors.

There is a pressing need to develop a robust management strategy via enhancing the resiliency of the community, particularly in the context of complex urban environments, like Jakarta. Resilience is conceptualized within specific contexts and uniquely tailored to the targeted setting, yet research regarding the operational concept of a flood-resilient community in the context of Jakarta remains limited. This paper will elaborate this operational concept through understanding the desirable features and influential barriers of a flood-resilient community through the lenses of three main stakeholder groups: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and development. It will also discuss the ways in which the synergies that exist across these groups can be enhanced. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied in this study, and multiple sources of data were used. The findings indicate that these groups share common views regarding the importance of human aspects being central to resilience building efforts. We argue there is an urgent need to shift the flood resilience building paradigm towards building community resilience from the people and to apply a collaborative governance approach to facilitate effective partnership between the actors involved.

Furthermore, climate change and the need for the efficient use of resources are providing additional pressures that cannot be addressed solely with "Business-as-usual" solutions. In this paper, the consequences of such problems and limitations on the urban environment have been assessed through the identification of linked major impacts (e.g., urban flooding and pollution events) and societal externalities (e.g., economic losses, health and social issues, and environmental risks). Since Nature-based Solutions (NBS) consider human well-being, socio-economic development, and governance principles, they open new perspectives regarding urban sustainability, quality of life, and climate change adaptation. To highlight their added value to existing Urban Drainage Systems (UDS), the synergies that result from implementing NBS with traditional urban drainage systems were identified and assessed. Based on a comprehensive framework, for both wastewater and stormwater, the relevant opportunities for rethinking UDS and NBS were identified. Most relevant positive effects go beyond the mitigation of existing intrinsic constraints of traditional systems (e.g., dealing with the control of pollutants or stormwater management) since NBS also provide important economic, social, and environmental co-benefits by including water in urban planning and providing greener open spaces. This integrated and complementary solution not only represents a contribution to the sustainable management of urban water, but also enables an increase in the resilience of urban areas and, in particular, water services against climate change and for additional social co-benefits.

This study has been conducted to assess the vulnerabilities of the coastal region of Bangladesh by considering the IPCC framework of vulnerability studies and using multivariate statistical techniques. A total of 31 indicators have been used of which 24 are socio-economic and 7 are natural (exposure) indicators and these indicators have been retrieved from the secondary source. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied to find unequal weights of all indicators. Afterward, 7 vulnerability groups (Principal Components - PCs) have been retained which eigenvalue greater than one in accordance with Kaiser Criterion. Demographic Vulnerability (PC1), Economic Vulnerability (PC2), Agricultural Vulnerability (PC3), Water Vulnerability (PC4), Health Vulnerability (PCS), Climate Vulnerability (PC6) and Infrastructure' Vulnerability (PC7) are the principle vulnerable groups considering both present (2013) and the future (2050) climate change scenarios. Spatial maps of each group have been generated to assess the regional variation of above mentioned multispectral vulnerability profile across the coastal region of Bangladesh. Climate change will change dramatically the future vulnerability profile which will be alarming for agro-ecological systems of that region. The findings of this study might be useful for policy makers as well as planners.	[Uddin, Md Nasir; Islam, A. K. M. Saiful; Bala, Sujit Kumar; Islam, G. M.

The effect of urban spatial expansion, instead of densification of assets within existing urban cells, on flood risk has rarely been reported. Here, we project the future flood risk of seven urban agglomerations in China, home to over 750 million people. The inundated urban land areas in the future are projected to be 4 to 19 times that at present. Without considering the urban spatial expansion, the inundated urban land areas will be underestimated by 10-50%. Urban land is more likely to be inundated than non-urban land, and the newly-developed urban land will be inundated more easily than the historical urban land. The results demonstrate the urgency of integrating climate change mitigation, reasonable urban land expansion, and increased flood protection levels to minimize the flood risk in urban land. Urban agglomerations in China are projected to face a 4-to-19-fold increase in flood risk, with the greatest increases in southern China, according to hydrodynamic flood model simulations which account for increases in urban land area	[Jiang, Ruijie; Lu, Hui; Yang, Kun; Zhou, Jiayue; Li, Wenyu; Xu, Nan; Guan, Dabo] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui] Tsinghua Univ, Xian Inst Surveying & Mapping, Joint Res Ctr Next Generat Smart Mapping, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Deliang] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Yamazaki, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Pan, Ming; Yang, Yuan] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Western Weather & Water Extremes, La Jolla, CA USA; [Pan, Ming] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ USA; [Guan, Dabo] UCL, Bartlett Sch Sustainable Construct, London, England; [Tian, Fuqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China	Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; University of Gothenburg; University of Tokyo; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Princeton University; University of London; University College London; Tsinghua University	Lu, H (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, H (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Xian Inst Surveying & Mapping, Joint Res Ctr Next Generat Smart Mapping, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.	luhui@tsinghua.edu.cn	XU, nan/KDP-0628-2024; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; LI, Wendy/GQQ-0047-2022; shi, chen/KEH-8339-2024; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; Chen, Deliang/ABF-1654-2021; Wang, Jinlong/KHC-3829-2024; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022	Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; Chen, Deliang/0000-0002-6255-7811; Yang, Yuan/0000-0002-3030-5476	This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC3002901), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP, grant No. 2019QZKK0206), and the International Partnership Program [2022YFC3002901]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019QZKK0206]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [183311KYSB20200015]; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences	This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC3002901), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP, grant No. 2019QZKK0206), and the International Partnership Program; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences	This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFC3002901), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP, grant No. 2019QZKK0206), and the International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 183311KYSB20200015).		63	6	6	36	36	SPRINGERNATURE	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND		2662-4435		COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON	Commun.

J	Alcantara, AL; Ahn, KH				Alcantara, Angelika L.; Ahn, Kuk-Hyun			Future flood riverine risk analysis considering the heterogeneous impacts from tropical cyclone and non-tropical cyclone rainfalls: Application to daily flows in the Nam River Basin, South Korea	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Tropical cyclone; Flood frequency analysis; Nam river basin; Climate change	LAND-COVER CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; RADAR; DISTRIBUTIONS; OSCILLATION; SIMULATION	Riverine floods are often caused by prolonged or heavy rainfall. These heavy or extreme rainfall events are mainly driven by various climate mechanisms, which have often been ignored in flood risk assessments. This study presents a climate mechanism-based flood frequency analysis approach, accommodating a direct linkage between risk metrics for decision making and the dominant causal climate mechanisms driving riverine flooding. The approach adopts several techniques including Markov chain analysis, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) resampling, and Z-score-based jittering method to mimic historical climate data with the heterogeneous consideration of the climate mechanisms. After that, the effects of climate change are incorporated through the manipulation of the transition matrix and the utilization of a quantile mapping approach. Future flood frequencies are quantified using the generated climate sequence and a rainfall-runoff model. Our proposed approach is described as a case study for the Nam River Basin, South Korea using two climate mechanisms, the Tropical Cyclone (TC) and nonTCs. Our results indicate that both mechanisms could potentially contribute to future flood extremes, especially when subjected to climate change. However, TCs have been proven to be the primary driving climate mechanism that shows more significant and immediate effects on the probable extremes in the study area. The approach presented in this study can provide new insights into future flood management.

J	Park, SJ; Lee, DK				Park, Sang-Jin; Lee, Dong-Kun			Prediction of coastal flooding risk under climate change impacts in South Korea using machine learning algorithms	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						coastal management; risk analysis; coastal vulnerability; natural hazards; climate change impacts; machine learning; regional climate models	VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; NATURAL HAZARDS; TAMIL-NADU; GIS; MANAGEMENT	Coastal areas have been affected by hazards such as floods and storms due to the impact of climate change. As coastal systems continue to become more socially and environmentally complex, the damage these hazards cause is expected to increase and intensify. To reduce such negative impacts, vulnerable coastal areas and their associated risks must be identified and assessed. In this study, we assessed the flooding risk to coastal areas of South Korea using multiple machine learning algorithms. We predicted coastal areas with high flooding risks, as this aspect has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. We forecasted hazards under different representative concentration pathway climate change scenarios and regional climate models while considering ratios of sea level rise. Based on the results, a risk probability map was developed using a probability ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values of probability indicate areas at higher risk of compound events such as high tides and heavy rainfall. The accuracy of the average receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.946 using a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The predicted risk probability in 10 year increments from the 2030s to the 2080s showed that the risk probability for southern coastal areas is higher than those of the eastern and western coastal areas. From this study, we determined that a probabilistic approach to analyzing the future risk of coastal flooding would be effective to support decision-making for integrated coastal zone management.

J	Dritsas, SE				Dritsas, Sophoclis E.			The effect of sea level rise on coastal populations: The case of the Gironde (Estuaries of Gironde)	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article						Environmental migration; Human-environmental vulnerability; Climate change; Coastal area	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; ZONE	As part of the effort to address the degree of vulnerability and the potential risk of flooding from the rise in the sea level due to climate change, the coastal area of the Gironde delta (Estuaries of Gironde) shows that this vulnerability can be perceived only from an environmental point of view. In this paper, we seek to show an inextricable interaction between the pure environmental dimension and the population dimension. Currently, rising sea levels do not contribute in the same way to the potential emergence of flood risk of coastal areas such as river delta estuaries. This means that the concept of risk intensity should be carefully considered because a municipal unit that currently has a very low degree of vulnerability, could very well be subject to a change in its risk category in the future. This study indicates that local-regional bodies should focus on the fact that the group of municipalities that currently have a low level of vulnerability need to be able to cope with rising population pressures over a 2050-time horizon. Some municipalities currently showing low risk, may face a heightened risk in the future because, not only will new coastal areas and estuaries of the rivers face climate change induced flooding, but also likely population growth can cause an additional incidence of flooding.

The immense amount of water led to extensive flooding and landslides that killed more than 200 people, injured more than 500 people, and caused direct damages valued at approximately 1.2 billion USD. Here, we quantify how the intensity of the precipitation leading to such exceptional impacts is attributable to anthropogenic climate change. First, we define the event as the regional maximum of annual maximum 15-day average rainfall (Rx15day). We then analyse the trend in Rx15day over Central Vietnam from the observations and simulations in the PRIMAVERA and CORDEX-CORE ensembles, which pass our evaluation tests, by applying the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in which location and scale parameters exponentially covary with increasing global temperatures. Combining these observations and model results, we find that the 2020 event, occurring about once every 80 years (at least 17 years), has not changed in either probability of occurrence (a factor 1.0, ranging from 0.4 to 2.4) or intensity (0%, ranging from -8 to +8%) in the present climate in comparison with early-industrial climate. This implies that the effect of human-induced climate change contributing to this persistent extreme rainfall event is small compared to natural variability. However, given the scale of damage of this hazard, our results underline that more investment in disaster risk reduction for this type of rainfall-induced flood hazard is of importance, even independent of the effect of anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, as both observations and model simulations will be extended with the passage of time, we encourage more climate change impact investigations on the extreme in the future that help adaptation and mitigation plans and raise awareness in the country.

Reducing the use of air conditioners is one such measure. While it seems to be effective in mitigating climate change, it may also reduce individuals' well-being and increase the risk of heatstroke. To compare the impact of reducing air conditioner use and the mortality risks, the indicator Loss of Happy Life Expectancy (LHpLE), which measures the reduction in the length of life that individuals can spend happily, was used. The reduction in well-being due to non-use of air conditioners was obtained by applying the propensity score matching method to the results of a questionnaire. We evaluated the impact of reducing air conditioner use in both the current and future situation in comparison to the mortality risk from flood and heatstroke, respectively. The increase in mortality risk due to flooding was estimated based on numerical simulation, and the increase in the risk of mortality due to heatstroke was estimated based on existing reports in Japan. Using these results, the magnitude of the impacts on LHpLE caused by the reduction in well-being due to the non-use of an air conditioner and the increase in the mortality risks were compared, both for the current situation and the future. The results show that LHpLE due to non-use of air conditioners was much greater than that due to the risk of mortality due to flood and heatstroke, and implied that reducing air conditioner use is not necessarily a good way as a mitigation measure. This result would be useful for creating and implementing measures to counter climate change and could also be applied in many other fields.

There is a need for supplementing physical models with efficient, probabilistic methodologies for compound flood hazard assessment that can be applied under a range of climate and environment conditions. Here we propose an extension to the joint probability optimal sampling method (JPM-OS), which has been widely used for storm surge assessment, and apply it for rainfall-surge compound hazard assessment under climate change at the catchment-scale. We utilize thousands of synthetic tropical cyclones (TCs) and physics-based models to characterize storm surge and rainfall hazards at the coast. Then we implement a Bayesian quadrature optimization approach (JPM-OS-BQ) to select a small number (similar to 100) of storms, which are simulated within a high-resolution flood model to characterize the compound flood hazard. We show that the limited JPM-OS-BQ simulations can capture historical flood return levels within 0.25 m compared to a high-fidelity Monte Carlo approach. We find that the combined impact of 2100 sea-level rise (SLR) and TC climatology changes on flood hazard change in the Cape Fear Estuary, NC will increase the 100-year flood extent by 27% and increase inundation volume by 62%. Moreover, we show that probabilistic incorporation of SLR in the JPM-OS-BQ framework leads to different 100-year flood maps compared to using a single mean SLR projection. Our framework can be applied to catchments across the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts under a variety of climate and environment scenarios.

This may result in considerable changes in urban flooding and yield a variation in the rate and volume of stormwater, resulting in the failure of stormwater collection systems. In the current paper, the effects of different downscaling methods on a built urban network have been assessed and compared. The case study is a 320-ha urban watershed with a built stormwater collection system located in the City of Tehran, Iran. Two single (SDSM and DMDM) and two multisite downscaling techniques with a daily temporal resolution have been employed and two sub daily (based of GEV distribution and MOF) methods have been used to further disaggregate the downscaled data. To evaluate the climate change impacts, three climate change scenarios, i.e. RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, have been used. Based on our findings, DMDM appears to outperform the other techniques in terms of our statistical similarity and dissimilarity metrics for daily downscaling. In addition, the sub-daily disaggregation method via GEV distribution delivers better results in comparison to the MOF. After simulating the stormwater collection system based on the downscaling results, we found that the number of flooded channels and junctions using RCP 8.5 results is significantly higher than RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios, indicating the relatively high risk of urban flooding under RCP 8.5 scenario.

Glacier shrinkage leads to cascading impacts, including changes in river flow regimes, availability of water resources for downstream populations and economy, changes in the occurrence and severity of natural hazards, and cultural changes associated with landscape character and identity. In this study, we analyze impacts of mountain cryosphere change through a lens of Loss and Damage (L&D), a mechanism of international climate policy that tries to evaluate and reduce negative consequences of climate change for societies. We analyze the effects of climate change on glacier change, glacier lake formation and growth, hydrological regimes, and associated impacts on human societies in the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes, now and under future scenarios. We use various methods such as literature review, glacial lake outburst flood, and hydrologic modeling to examine three major dimensions of cryospheric change and associated human impacts: (i) ice loss; (ii) glacial hazards; and (iii) variability of water availability. We identify the damage and losses in terms of the number of people affected by glacial hazards, monetized agricultural crop loss due to water loss, and non-economic values local people attribute to glacier loss. We find that different levels of warming have important negative but differentiated effects on natural and human systems. We also contend that the extent of loss and damage will largely be determined by governance and adaptation decisions such as water resource management and disaster risk management. We suggest that these lines of evidence are more explicitly taken into account in L&D policies.

Based on daily precipitation data from the NEX-GDDP dataset, rainfall from rain-storms is first calculated by a multi-model ensemble method for four periods from 1986 to 2100. Combined with population data from the SSP2 scenario, the global population exposure to rainstorms is then calculated and analyzed. Finally, the contribution rates of climate change effect, population change effect, and joint change effect on exposure change are quantitatively assessed. The results showed that (1) Population exposure to rainstorms shows a linear upward trend from base period to the late 21st century period in most regions, and the mid-21st century period compared with base period has the fastest rate of increase. (2) The spatial patterns of population exposure to rainstorms are very similar for the four periods and the areas with high exposure are mainly distributed in Asia, population exposure of Africa is gradually increasing. The countries with high exposure show little volatility, especially the top eight countries. (3) The change in total exposure is mainly due to population change. Based on the composition of the total exposure change for each country, the number of countries whose climate change effect is greater than that of population change is gradually increasing, and this number reaches more than a quarter of the total when the late 21st century period is compared with the mid-21st century period.

Over the past few decades, Pakistan has been the home of climate-related disasters like floods. This paper attempts to examine the effect of floods on the rural communities; those are vulnerable to floods, and their livelihood patterns were damaged due to flooding events in Hazara Division. This research study assessed the causes, the impact, and the aftermath of flooding and their link with climate change in Hazara Division (Torghar, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, and Haripur). The significance of environmental changes and flood's threats were discovered and examined through the logistic regressions and then pathway analysis. The findings showed that floods, directly and indirectly, affected the livelihood, social standing, and physical and economic status of rural communities. Rise in poverty level is also reported in already vulnerable communities that further increase their exposure to risks and hazards. This study calls for local government strengthening, early warning systems, and (non)financial assistance in times of needs to minimize the floods risk and disastrous impacts on localities and resources.

Therefore, this study addresses the livelihood vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies in response to the climate change issues based on empirical evidence from wetland communities using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) in Tanguar haor, located in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The finding shows that people of the study area are switching their formal livelihood activities into alternative sources. Crop diversification, homestead gardening, erosion proofing, and cage aquaculture are commonly used by the studied communities to adapt to climate change impacts. The main driver of vulnerabilities was found to be lack of education, underdeveloped infrastructures, lack of advanced health facilities, and lack of alternative livelihoods during extreme events. Therefore, people living in and around the haor region need special consideration. Overall, the study suggests that policy or institutional arrangements are required to promote the better governance system for local communities to improve their living standard so that they can achieve resilience to the impacts of climate variability and change in this area.

Accordingly, the changes in the daily maximum (T-max) and minimum temperatures (T-min) in the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River Basin (YBRB), along with its three sub-regions (Tibetan Plateau-TP, Himalayan Belt-HB, and Floodplain-FP) were evaluated here using the Bayesian model average (BMA) results from nine climate models in the CMIP6 under four future scenarios, and the corresponding uncertainty of the projected results was analyzed. The results showed the following: (1) The BMA can simulate the T-max and T-min of the YBRB well. (2) Future T-max and T-min over the YBRB exhibited an overall fluctuating upward trend. Even under the most ideal sustainable development scenario examined (SSP126), the average T-max (T-min) over the YBRB was projected to increase by 3.53 (3.38) degrees C by the end of this century. (3) Although the future changes in the YBRB are predicted to fall below the global average, the future temperature difference in the YBRB will increase further. (4) The uncertainty increased with prediction time, while spatially, the regions with the uncertainty were the TP > HB > FP. These findings can provide a reference for the YBRB climate change adaptation strategies.

It is generally agreed that the intensification of climate change effects, such as extreme weather events, requires strengthening in the mechanisms of adaptation and the endogenous self-organization of urban systems. An operative way to adapt is by mainstreaming climate resilience, i.e., the iterative process of integrating climate change considerations into policymaking, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring processes at national and subnational levels. This paper falls under this heading, and it aims at building an innovative methodology to experiment with data-driven approaches to support the resilient transition of the city of Turin in Italy. The process aims to create territorial knowledge of specific weather phenomenon, that cloudburst events are, by filling the gap of existing hazard information with original vulnerability datasets. The proposed approach will create a hydraulic vulnerability map by identifying cloudburst vulnerable areas with a GIS-based spatial overlay. The paper will employ an array of datasets combined with original modelling techniques elaborated with the help of the open-source InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) software program. The results allow us to understand what would happen if the urban water network failed to discharge during a phenomenon of intense rain and, consequently, which city areas should undergo adaptation and transformation to reduce their flooding vulnerability.

Insurance can be used by individuals to protect against the risk of natural disaster loss. However, individuals often purchase insufficient amounts of insurance against disaster risks, which may be due to them neglecting the likelihood of these risks which are perceived as falling below some threshold level of concern. Using choice architecture, such as alternative forms of risk communication, can nudge individuals to pay attention to natural disasters and increase insurance demand by raising perceived risk and facilitating the comprehension of low probabilities. In an online experiment, we tested whether reframing a low flood probability in terms of the cumulative likelihood across time, as well as whether visualizations of risk on ladders and grids may be effective in raising flood insurance demand. Our primary finding is that reframing of probabilities, especially in combination with the visual aids, generally raises (lowers) demand for flood insurance among younger (older) homeowners and those who are more (less) concerned about the consequences of climate change. Whereas, on average we find no significant impact on flood insurance demand of any of the risk communication tools tested either in isolation or combination. Based on these findings, we draw several lessons for risk communication.	[Robinson, Peter John; Botzen, W. J.

Hydrological simulations with historical forcing and climate change scenario inputs have been performed to better understand the change in magnitude and frequency of extreme discharge events that cause flooding. Simulations are applied to all major rivers of Morocco, including a total of 16 basins that cover the majority of the country. An ensemble of temperature and precipitation input parameter sets was generated to analyze input uncertainty, an approach that can be extended to other regions of the world, including data-sparse regions. Parameter uncertainty was also included in the analyses. Historical simulations comprise the period 1979-2021, while future simulations (2015-2100) were performed under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Clear patterns of changing flood extremes are projected; these changes are significant when considered as a proportion of the land area of the country. Two types of basins have been identified, based on their different behavior in climate change scenarios. In the Northern/Mediterranean basins we observe a decrease in the frequency and intensity of events by 2050 under both SSPs, whereas for the remaining catchments higher and more frequent high-flow events in the form of flash floods are detected. Our analysis revealed that this is a consequence of the reduction in rainfall accumulation and intensity in both SSPs for the first type of basins, while the opposite applies to the other type. More generally, we propose a methodology that does not rely on observed time series of discharge, so especially for regions where those do not exist or are not available, and that can be applied to undertake future flood projections in the most data-scarce regions. This method allows future hydrological hazards to be estimated for essentially any region of the world.

Projections of the runoff in future climate conditions are needed for long-term planning of water resources and flood protection. In this study, we evaluate the possible climate change impacts on the runoff regime in eight selected basins located in the whole territory of Slovakia. The projected runoff in the basins studied for the reference period (1981-2010) and three future time horizons (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) was simulated using the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) bucket-type model (the TUW (Technische Universitat Wien) model). A calibration strategy based on the selection of the most suitable decade in the observation period for the parameterization of the model was applied. The model was first calibrated using observations, and then was driven by the precipitation and air temperatures projected by the KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut) and MPI (Max Planck Institute) regional climate models (RCM) under the A1B emission scenario. The model's performance metrics and a visual inspection showed that the simulated runoff using downscaled inputs from both RCM models for the reference period represents the simulated hydrological regimes well. An evaluation of the future, which was performed by considering the representative climate change scenarios, indicated that changes in the long-term runoff's seasonality and extremality could be expected in the future. In the winter months, the runoff should increase, and decrease in the summer months compared to the reference period. The maximum annual daily runoff could be more extreme for the later time horizons (according to the KNMI scenario for 2071-2100). The results from this study could be useful for policymakers and river basin authorities for the optimum planning and management of water resources under a changing climate.

Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Sea-Level Rise	WATER			English	Review						sea-level rise; climate change; shoreline erosion; adaptation; managed retreat	LATIN-AMERICA; CORAL-REEFS; NOURISHMENT; PROTECTION; PATHWAYS; DEFENSE; EROSION; DESIGN; FUTURE; SUSTAINABILITY	The Earth's climate is changing; ice sheets and glaciers are melting and coastal hazards and sea level are rising in response. With a total population of over 300 million people situated on coasts, including 20 of the planet's 33 megacities (over 10 million people), low-lying coastal areas represent one of the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change. Many of the largest cities along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. are already experiencing frequent high tide flooding, and these events will increase in frequency, depth, duration and extent as sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century and beyond. Cities in southeast Asia and islands in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean are also suffering the effects of extreme weather events combined with other factors that increase coastal risk. While short-term extreme events such as hurricanes, El Ninos and severe storms come and go and will be more damaging in the short term, sea-level rise is a long-term permanent change of state. However, the effects of sea-level rise are compounded with other hazards, such as increased wave action or a loss of ecosystems. As sea-level rise could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, this may be one of the greatest challenges that human civilization has ever faced, with associated inundation of major cities, loss of coastal infrastructure, increased saltwater intrusion and damage to coastal aquifers among many other global impacts, as well as geopolitical and legal implications. While there are several short-term responses or adaptation options, we need to begin to think longer term for both public infrastructure and private development. This article provides an overview of the status on adaptation to climate change in coastal zones.

Cambodia's average rice paddy yield at around 3 t ha(-1) is around 50% of the yield potential and losses caused by weed competition have been shown to be a significant constraint. The most important issues currently affecting weed management in Cambodia's cropping systems are (a) increased climate variability and climate change, and (b) migration of labour from the rural workforce and consequent rapid mechanisation of agriculture. As a result of climate change, the wet season in Cambodia now begins and ends approximately one month later, and the bimodal rainfall distribution has strengthened, resulting in more extreme events of drought and flood during the wet season. A decline in the availability of agricultural labour has resulted in rapid mechanisation of land preparation, broadcast seeding, herbicide use and machine harvesting of rice and these changes have had significant repercussions for weed management. The resultant challenges and opportunities for weed management are presented and discussed. The main weed management challenges are associated with rice crop intensification, transition from transplanting to direct-seeded rice, changed planting dates and tillage practices in response to climate change, over-reliance on post-emergence herbicides, excessive inversion tillage, and lack of knowledge about the safe and efficacious use of herbicides. Opportunities for improved weed management in Cambodia's cropping systems include the development of integrated weed management for double crop intensive rice systems, transition from hand broadcasting to drill-seeded rice, new seeding windows and minimum tillage, non-transgenic herbicide resistant crops and education and training of input sellers and farmers to improve safety and efficacy of herbicide use.

The key challenges of the approach are the choice of the meteorological variables and statistics thereof and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed to achieve this, and it remains unclear if and to which extent they result in comparable flood change projections. Here, we compare projections of annual maximum floods (AMFs) derived from three different scenario-neutral methods for a prealpine study catchment. The methods chosen use different types of meteorological data, namely, observations, regional climate model output, and weather generator data. The different time series account for projected changes in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, in the occurrence statistics of precipitation, and of daily precipitation extremes. Resulting change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes differs in sign between the methods (range of -6% to +7% for flood peak magnitudes and -11% to +14% for flood volumes). Moreover, variability of projected peak magnitudes and flood volumes depends on method with one approach leading to a generally larger spread. The differences between the methods vary depending on whether peak magnitudes or flood volumes are considered and different relationships between peak magnitude and volume change result. These findings can be linked to differing flood regime changes among the three approaches. The study highlights that considering selected aspects of climate change only when performing scenario-neutral studies may lead to differing representations of flood generating processes by the approaches and thus different quantifications of flood change. As each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended to combine several scenario-neutral approaches to obtain more robust results.

By using structured questionnaire, primary data were collected from the targeted households in the study region. Data on socio-demographics, water security, health, social networks and climate variability were collected from the targeted respondents in this study area, and combined into indices. The IPCC framework was utilized that characterizes vulnerability into exposure, sensitivity and its adaptive capacity. Findings of our study showed that tehsil Shabqadar was more vulnerable among three studied tehsils particularly in natural disasters, health, water and land holding status. Tehsil Tangi was the second high vulnerable tehsil followed by tehsil Charsadda relative to other LVI components with the exclusion of livelihood strategies and financial constraints. Findings of this study provide a better understanding of the social and behavioral trends as well as an integrated and holistic view of the agriculture, climate change and livelihoods process in assessing the vulnerability. The findings and this pragmatic approach will be helpful in intending specific strategies and policy effectiveness to lessen susceptibility of households to climatic variations.

Understanding the nature of media messaging regarding flooding related to hurricanes is crucial to not only identifying implications for broader social dynamics in an age of accelerating climate change, but also to provide insight for local and national journalists tasked with covering hurricanes. Using the case study of coverage of Hurricane Florence, this analysis assesses how hurricane news coverage may be potentially motivating or demotivating audiences to pursue behaviors such as preparing for hurricanes, evacuating if need be, helping neighbors with fewer resources, and aiding in recovery efforts. We find that news constructions did vary between local and national coverage in terms of threat and efficacy messaging and flood frames, and these changed over time. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for covering hurricanes in an age of accelerating climate change.

Although multipurpose projects can and do deliver a range of water services, 'win-win' outcomes are not guaranteed. Emerging water and energy risks are altering the net benefits from operating reservoirs to deliver hydropower generation, water supply, flood control, or other purposes. This paper shows that new hydropower governance approaches are needed to efficiently and fairly reallocate water under risks. We demonstrate that dynamic water reallocation is fundamental to the resilience of multipurpose reservoir systems and examine three potential reforms: periodic relicensing, water tariffs, and hydropower sustainability performance bonds.

However, researches on vulnerability to climate change in the African continent have seldom focused on Indigenous Fruit Trees (IFTs) although they are an essential part of the strategic forest resources and livelihood systems of local communities. This paper explores the vulnerability of two IFTs, shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) and dawadawa (Parkia biglobosa) to climatic and other stressors that are not directly linked to climate change in rural Ghana and the implications for planning. The paper analyzed vulnerability from farmer perspectives elicited through a mixed study design involving the use of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods and a household survey. The results reveal that IFTs are highly vulnerable to drought, rainstorms, bushfires and charcoal production and less vulnerable to heavy precipitation, flash floods and sand mining. Such vulnerability arising from the combined effects of multiple stressors has led to a decreasing trend in production and yields of IFTS over the past few decades, adversely affecting livelihoods of rural women and households. To reduce vulnerability, it is an imperative to promote Environmental Change Adaptation Planning (ECAP) that prioritizes conservation and propagation of IFTs, and diversification of rural livelihoods.

Adaptation is therefore crucial to manage the growing threat to coastal communities and cities. This case study focuses on Lagos, Nigeria, one of the world's largest urban centers where rapid urbanization, poor urban planning, degrading infrastructure, and inadequate preparedness compounds flood vulnerability. We situate flood risk perceptions within the context of climate-induced mobilities in Lagos, which no study has done, filling a necessary knowledge gap. Furthermore, we apply a unique approach to flood risk perception and its linkage to migration, by using three measures of risk - affect, probability, and consequence, as opposed to a singular measure. Results show that the affect measure of flood risk perception is significantly higher than probability and consequence measures. Furthermore, flood risk perception is shaped by prior experiences with flooding and proximity to hazard. The effect of proximity on risk perception differs across the three measures. We also found that flood risk perceptions and future migration intentions are positively correlated. These results demon-strate the usefulness of using multiple measures to assess flood risk perceptions, offering multiple pathways for targeted interventions and flood risk communication.

Without dam structures, this project has been continuously playing its crucial role in diverting water for irrigation, separating sediments, and controlling flood for 2275 years. In this study, the predicaments of the Dujiangyan Project under the background of rapid urbanization and social economic development were summarized by conducting the field research and using the Indicators of Hydrological alteration (IHA) method: excessive diversion of water, disruption of hydrological pulses, erosion and deposition imbalance and conflicts between power generation and water supply. These contradictions have led to the weakening of the function of automatic water diversion and sand removal in the Dujiangyan Project. Considering the influence of climate change and strong human activities, we pointed out the challenges faced by the millennium ancient weir in balancing human and environmental water usage and project operation and management based on the simulation results of the hydrological model. The corresponding suggestions about strengthening agricultural water saving, generating artificial flood peak were provided to protect and continue to maintain the function of the Dujiangyan Project.

Disaster risk continues to grow as a result of unplanned urbanization, persistent poverty, and ecosystem degradation. In this context, insurance is a risk financing mechanism, part of acomprehensive disaster risk management strategy, which plays an important role in disaster risk reduction. Being an economy in transition, Malaysia is in a unique position in relation to agriculture insurance. Based on primary and secondary sources of information and literature review, the present study analyzed the potential effects of agriculture insurance for disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Malaysia. The proposed framework of agriculture insurance suggests the involvement of policy makers and implementers, marketing channels, and micro users for DRR in Malaysia. The study identified challenges for agriculture insurance in Malaysia, such as lack of experience from international practices, limited products, lack of necessary data, limited financial capacity, and high administrative operational costs. Suitable recommendations that aim to promote agriculture insurance and reduce disaster risk in agro-production are offered. These recommendations emphasize proper government initiatives and public-private partnership of insurance companies to assist the market and the designing of suitable insurance products.	[Alam, A. S.

Framed by a systematic review of risk reduction measures, we assess the extent to which Austrian policies are characteristic of an anticipatory, forward-looking flood management approach to cope with expected future stresses on the flood risk, such as climate change and land development. The analysis shows that risk reduction measures build on status quo assessments and do not explicitly consider future changes in the flood hazard or vulnerability. However, new design standards for extreme events, the proliferation of large-scale flood retention, tightened land development and building restrictions, and novel planning instruments indicate that Austrian policies are increasingly forward-looking to more effectively mitigate future increases in the flood risk. This temporal reorientation is a consequence of a wider policy shift from flood control to integrated flood risk management. Faced with the increasing spatial interplay of risk reduction measures (e.g. securing land for flood runoff and flood retention), our analysis shows that inter-sectoral cooperation between water management and spatial planning can support long-term flood management decisions and maintain the ability to adapt to changing future conditions.

We used benthic macroinvertebrates to test the hypothesis that extreme drought events could lead to local biotic homogenization in a floodplain pond. We took sediment samples in three sampling areas of a floodplain pond during a period of the usual hydrological cycle and during an extreme weather event that caused an atypical hydrological cycle with prolonged drought period. We found that community composition significantly differs between usual hydrological cycle and extreme drought periods, in which only species adapted to unfavorable environmental conditions remained. The spatial beta diversity decreased during the extreme drought periods, presenting lower variability compared to the usual hydrological cycle. However, species density, richness, and diversity increased during the droughts. We expect that, in scenarios of climate change with frequent extreme weathers, droughts may cause permanent negative impacts on aquatic communities, leading to biotic homogenization. Moreover, our findings indicate that prolonged droughts could increase the time needed to community recovery, suggesting lower community resilience to environmental stressors. Therefore, increasing frequency of extreme drought events may result in an alternative community structure.

An ensemble modeling framework to study the effects of climate change on the trophic state of shallow reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						GCM/RCM; Hydrological modeling; Climate change; Model uncertainty; Freshwater security; Lakes and reservoirs	FLOOD FREQUENCY ESTIMATION; WATER-BALANCE MODEL; REGIONAL CLIMATE; LAND-USE; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; MESOTROPHIC LAKE; HAMILTON HARBOR; ASSESSMENT-TOOL	Our understanding of the potential impact of climatic change on catchment hydrology and aquatic system dynamics has been advanced over the past decade, but there are still considerable knowledge gaps with respect to its effects on water quality vis-a-vis the increasing demands for drinking water. In this study, we developed an integrated hydrological-water quality (SWAT-YRWQM) model to elucidate the effects of a changing climate on the trophic state of the shallow Yuqiao Reservoir. Using a two-step downscaling process, we reproduced the prevailing meteorological conditions, as well as the streamflows in three major tributaries of the study area. A sensitivity analysis exercise showed that the nature of the calibration dataset used, namely the range of flows (i.e., dry versus wet years) included, can profoundly influence the predictive power of our modeling framework. Our climatic scenarios projected a minor change of the streamflow rates, but a variant degree of increase of the riverine total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and associated loading rates into the reservoir. Consequently, a significant rise of in-lake TP concentrations is projected for the near (2016-2030) and distant (2031-2050) future compared to the reference (2006-2015) conditions. Interestingly, the ambient TP levels appear to be lower in the distant relative to the near future, owing to changes in the magnitude and relative contribution of both external and internal nutrient loading sources. Our analysis also highlights the importance of reservoir operation practices to regulate water levels as a means for mitigating the climate change impact on the trophic status of the Yuqiao Reservoir, given that the diversion of low-nutrient water from the upstream basin can significantly reduce (30-40%) the TP concentrations. Our findings are highly relevant to the on-going debate about the potential implications of climate change for water availability, highlighting the importance of adaptation strategies to optimize the water resources management.

This study analyzed the characteristics of hydro-climatic variables in the meso-scale Tuweihe catchment based on the observed data for the period 1956-2016 and a climate elastic method. The spatial distribution of dominant runoff processes (DRP) following land use changes in case of rainfall was identified. The results show significant decreasing trends in annual runoff, whereas slightly downward trends are identified for annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, 1984 is detected as the mutation year of the study period. The average contributions of climate change and human activities to the runoff reduction in the Tuweihe catchment were 33.2% and 66.8%, respectively. In general, the influences of human activities on runoff are applied mostly through the alteration of the catchment characteristics. The dominant runoff processes changes between 1980 and 2015 show significant effects of large-scale soil and water conservation measurements in the Tuweihe catchment. We found that Hortonian overland flow (HOF) and fast subsurface flow (SSF1) were the two main processes in 1980 (30.3% and 34.4% respectively), but the proportion of HOF decreased by 9.6% in 2015. The proportions of saturation overland flow (SOF) and SSF have increased to varying degrees, which means that the catchment is more prone to generate subsurface flow processes. Consequently, under similar rainfall conditions, the runoff yield of flood events decreases in the second period.

Resulting fines and penalties have triggered one of the largest ecological restoration efforts in U.S. history. Nearly $20 Billion in funding from oil spill-related claims and settlements will be available in the coming years for environmental restoration and economic recovery. At the same time, climate change is also impacting ecosystem form and function in the Gulf region, which could undermine the long-term sustainability of projects by limiting their useful life or impeding anticipated benefits over time (e.g., ecosystem services, flood protection). These challenges can be considered and addressed in project planning, selection and adaptive management phases of restoration. If decision-makers do not consider the longevity of projects in the face of climate-related stressors, in 30 to 50 years there could be very little to show for a $20 Billion investment, with the Gulf ecosystem still in need of extensive restoration but without the monetary resources to accomplish restoration goals and mitigate climate-related impacts. This paper provides a framework for decision makers to consider how to incorporate climate change considerations for wetland restoration activities related to the DWH spill.

Urban road planning, design, and land drainage systems are insufficiently coping with intense rainstorms, especially in the wet season. This is reflected in more research findings on urban flood impacts and road transport disruption over the past decade. Here we provide a critical overview of current research on urban road inundation, road traffic delays, and accessibility losses under flood conditions, and illustrate up-to-date practices with the relevant governmental institutions. Our review implies that urban flood management in road design is still at an embryonic stage in the Chinese megacities. Hence, we review the lessons and experiences of urban flood impacts on roads in the global context. We argue that it is essential to enhance better co-production practices on emergency responses and recovery measures between authorities, which is vital to improving flood resilience in uncertain climates.

A bibliometric analysis is adopted here to analyze the water-related publication data of Bangladesh. Water-quality-related research is the dominating research field in Bangladesh as compared to water-quantity (floods and droughts)-related ones. The most productive author was found to be Ahmed KM for water-related publication in Bangladesh. The arsenic contamination in Bangladesh has received the highest attention (13 out of the top 15 highly cited papers are related to arsenic contamination). Climate-change-related topics have been showing an increasing trend in research publications over the last 5 years. Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, prepared recently, is a visionary master plan that is expected to shape water management in Bangladesh in the coming decades to adapt to climate change. A set of recommendations is made here to achieve sustainable water management in Bangladesh.

A thin temperature label reveals temporal changes in the zooplankton structure on a Neotropical floodplain	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						temperature; threshold; plankton; climate change; indicator species	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; BIODIVERSITY; LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; FLUCTUATIONS; DOMINANCE; ROTIFERS	Temperature is a determinant factor for the distribution and structure of aquatic communities, as species have distinct ranges of thermic tolerance. Here we evaluated i) how does variation in water temperature affect the structure of the zooplankton community through time; and ii) what is the temperature threshold that alters the frequency and abundance of species. Zooplankton was sampled from 2000 to 2015 in six habitats of a Neotropical floodplain (22 degrees 40' - 22 degrees 50' S; 53 degrees 10' - 53 degrees 24'W) totaling 276 samples. We used a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to answer our questions. We recorded 297 zooplankton species, 196 rotifers, 69 cladocerans, and 33 copepods. Temperature variation affected community structure, with a positive change (abundance increased) temperature of 29.15 degrees C, increasing frequency and abundance for most species, and a negative change temperature (abundance decrease) of 20.15 degrees C, reducing these attributes. This study is a warning of the negative impacts of climate change, where temperature is predicted to increase, on the aquatic biological communities, as some species were sensitive to high temperatures.

The impact of climate change on road maintenance systems is a concern as it makes them more susceptible to weather events and subsequent damages. To tackle this issue, we propose an RMSDC (Road Maintenance Systems Using Deep Learning and Climate Adaptation) technique to improve road maintenance systems based on Deep learning and Climate Adaptation. RMSDC aims to use the multivariate classification technique and divides the dataset into training and test datasets. The RMSDC combines Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) techniques with road weather information and sensor data. However, in emerging nations, the effects of climate change are already apparent, which makes road networks particularly susceptible to extreme weather, floods, and landslides. Therefore, climate adaptation of road networks is essential, especially in developing nations with limited financial resources. To address this issue, we propose an intelligent and effective RMSDC that utilizes deep learning algorithms based on climate change predictions. The ConvLSTM block effectively captures the relationship between input features over time to calculate the root-mean deviation (RMSD). We evaluate RMSDC performance against frameworks for downscaling climate variables using two metrics: root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute difference. Through real evaluations, RMSDC consistently outperforms approaches with a reduced RMSE of 0.26. These quantitative results highlight how effective RMSDC is in addressing maintenance systems on road networks leading to proactive road maintenance strategies that enhance traffic safety, reduce costs, and improve environmental sustainability.

Flooding Related Consequences of Climate Change on Canadian Cities and Flow Regulation Infrastructure	WATER			English	Article						climate change; flood hazard; flood risk; return period; streamflow regulation rules; Canada	RISK; TRENDS; IMPACT; MODEL	This study discusses the flooding related consequences of climate change on most populous Canadian cities and flow regulation infrastructure (FRI). The discussion is based on the aggregated results of historical and projected future flooding frequencies and flood timing as generated by Canada-wide hydrodynamic modelling in a previous study. Impact assessment on 100 most populous Canadian cities indicate that future flooding frequencies in some of the most populous cities such as Toronto and Montreal can be expected to increase from 100 (250) years to 15 (22) years by the end of the 21st century making these cities highest at risk to projected changes in flooding frequencies as a consequence of climate change. Overall 40-60% of the analyzed cities are found to be associated with future increases in flooding frequencies and associated increases in flood hazard and flood risk. The flooding related impacts of climate change on 1072 FRIs located across Canada are assessed both in terms of projected changes in future flooding frequencies and changes in flood timings. Results suggest that 40-50% of the FRIs especially those located in southern Ontario, western coastal regions, and northern regions of Canada can be expected to experience future increases in flooding frequencies. FRIs located in many of these regions are also projected to experience future changes in flood timing underlining that operating rules for those FRIs may need to be reassessed to make them resilient to changing climate.

J	Maimone, M; Adams, T				Maimone, Mark; Adams, Tim			A practical method for estimating climate-related changes to riverine flood elevation and frequency	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; delta change factors; extreme rainfall; global climate models; riverine flooding; urban flooding	MODEL; INUNDATION; UNCERTAINTY	Floods have been occurring with increasing frequency, leading to damage to communities worldwide. These impacts are expected to continue to rise due to increases in the intensity of extreme rainfall. Global climate model (GCM) output, while imperfect in reproducing daily rainfall, is the only practical source of future projections of extreme rainfall intensification. This article presents a practical method for translating GCM precipitation output into usable outputs for stormwater and flood management planning at a regional or local level. The method estimates the impact of extreme storm intensification on riverine flooding using available runoff estimates from GCM precipitation and variable infiltration capacity models, focusing on changes in elevation and frequency due to climate change. It allows communities and utilities to obtain a screening-level estimate of climate change impacts to peak discharge rate statistics without conducting hydrologic modeling. This article outlines the method, its implementation for the 48 contiguous states of the United States, and an example calculation for a river in the eastern United States. Changes in extreme storm runoff intensity vary significantly by region, but much of the United States is projected to see increases of 25 and 50% by 2060 and 2090, respectively, for the RCP8.5 scenario.

Although it is globally observed due to climate change, local projections are needed to plan SLR adaptation strategies accurately. Since SLR is a community-wide multistakeholder problem at the local level, adaptation strategies can be more successful if the main stakeholders, e.g., government, residents, and businesses, collaborate in shaping them. Simulating the local socioeconomic system around SLR, including the interactions between essential stakeholders and nature, can be an effective way of evaluating different adaptation strategies and planning the best strategy for the local community. This work presents how such an SLR socioeconomic system can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and simulated using multiagent reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed multiagent RL framework serves two purposes. It provides a general scenario planning tool to investigate the cost-benefit analysis of natural events (e.g., flooding and hurricane) and agents' investments (e.g., infrastructure improvement). It also shows how much the total cost due to SLR can be reduced over time by optimizing the adaptation strategies. We demonstrate the proposed scenario planning tool using available economic data and sea-level projections for Pinellas County, Florida, in a case study.

Climate-Change Controls on River Delta Avulsion Location and Frequency	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						River deltas; River avulsions; Climate change; Sea-level rise; Sediment supply; Floods	RHINE-MEUSE DELTA; SEA-LEVEL; CHANNEL BELTS; YELLOW-RIVER; HOLOCENE; FRAMEWORK; HUANGHE; SYSTEM; EQUILIBRIUM; AUTORETREAT	Coastal rivers that build deltas undergo repeated avulsion events-that is, abrupt changes in river course-which we need to understand to predict land building and flood hazards in coastal landscapes. Climate change can impact water discharge, flood frequency, sediment supply, and sea level, all of which could impact avulsion location and frequency. Here we present results from quasi-2D morphodynamic simulations of repeated delta-lobe construction and avulsion to explore how avulsion location and frequency are affected by changes in relative sea level, sediment supply, and flood regime. Model results indicate that relative sea-level rise drives more frequent avulsions that occur at a distance from the shoreline set by backwater hydrodynamics. Reducing the sediment supply relative to transport capacity has little impact on deltaic avulsions, because, despite incision in the upstream trunk channel, deltas can still aggrade as a result of progradation. However, increasing the sediment supply relative to transport capacity can shift avulsions upstream of the backwater zone because aggradation in the trunk channel outpaces progradation-induced delta aggradation. Increasing frequency of overbank floods causes less frequent avulsions because floods scour the riverbed within the backwater zone, slowing net aggradation rates. Results provide a framework to assess upstream and downstream controls on avulsion patterns over glacial-interglacial cycles, and the impact of land use and anthropogenic climate change on deltas.

Ten Commandments for Sustainable, Safe, and W/Healthy Sandy Coasts Facing Global Change	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; coastal sustainability; risk reduction; coastal management; coastal resilience; coastal protection	ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; SEA-LEVEL RISE; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROTECTION; SERVICES; IMPACTS; EROSION; HABITATS; BEACHES	Sandy coasts represent about one-third of the global coastline and are among the most valuable and most vulnerable areas for humans and many other species. Socio-economic development and climate change impacts, together with traditional engineering for shore protection, have pervasively resulted in coastal squeeze, thereby threatening coastal life and economic activities, and the very survival of coastal ecosystems. In the past, the responses to problems such as land loss, coastal erosion and flooding were primarily reactive, through gray engineering solutions, with little interest shown in the ecosystem processes impacted by coastal armoring. In recent decades, coastal management strategies have become more diverse, embracing traditional engineering solutions alongside ecosystem-based measures. Even so, many of these new strategies still fail to meet sustainability criteria. Inspired by Per Bruun's "The Ten Demands for Coastal Protection" from 1972, this article attempts to consider these changes and knowledge acquired since the 1970s, in order to tentatively formulate "Ten Commandments" for the sustainability of sandy coasts in face of climate change and socio-economic development. As such, the paper offers a new vision and briefly summarizes good practices for the management of sandy coasts, particularly useful for those who, at whatever level of influence, could contribute to the long-term realization of this new vision.

J	Beevers, L; Collet, L; Aitken, G; Maravat, C; Visser, A				Beevers, Lindsay; Collet, Lila; Aitken, Gordon; Maravat, Claire; Visser, Annie			The influence of climate model uncertainty on fluvial flood hazard estimation	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood inundation; Climate change; Uncertainty quantification; Probabilistic	RISK; IMPACT	Floods are the most common and widely distributed natural hazard, threatening life and property worldwide. Governments worldwide are facing significant challenges associated with flood hazard, specifically: increasing urbanization; against the background of uncertainty associated with increasing climate variability under climate change. Thus, flood hazard assessments need to consider climate change uncertainties explicitly. This paper explores the role of climate change uncertainty through uncertainty analysis in flood modelling through a probabilistic framework using a Monte Carlo approach and is demonstrated for case study catchment. Different input, structure and parameter uncertainties were investigated to understand how important the role of a non-stationary climate may be on future extreme flood events. Results suggest that inflow uncertainties are the most influential in order to capture the range of uncertainty in inundation extent, more important than hydraulic model parameter uncertainty, and thus, the influence of non-stationarity of climate on inundation extent is critical to capture. Topographic controls are shown to create tipping points in the inundation-flow relationship, and these may be useful and important to quantify for future planning and policy. Full Monte Carlo analysis within the probabilistic framework is computationally expensive, and there is a need to explore more time-efficient strategies which may result in a similar estimate of the full uncertainty. Simple uncertainty quantification techniques such as Latin hypercube sampling approaches were tested to reduce computational burden.

Human activities- largely through the release of greenhouse gases-are driving rising global temperatures. Without a concerted effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to the effects of a changing climate, each increment of warming increases the risk of climate hazards (eg, heat waves, floods, and droughts) that that can adversely affect allergy and immunologic diseases. For instance, wildfires, which release large quantities of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 mm (an air pollutant), occur with greater intensity, frequency, and duration in a hotter climate. This increases the risk of associated respiratory outcomes such as allergy and asthma. Fortunately, many mitigation and adaptation strategies can be applied to limit the impacts of global warming. Adaptation strategies, ranging from promotions of behavioral changes to infrastructural improvements, have been effectively deployed to increase resilience and alleviate adverse health effects. Mitigation strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can not only address the problem at the source but also provide numerous direct health cobenefits. Although it is possible to limit the impacts of climate change, urgent and sustained action must be taken now. The health and scientific community can play a key role in promoting and implementing climate action to ensure a more sustainable and healthy future. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2023;152:1053-9.)

Climate change is challenging integrated water resource management policies that aim to balance human and environmental water needs. This paper explores the challenges of managing natural resources in a regime of climate change. It examines Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, where national water law requires a Basin Plan based on best available science. However, proactively responding to climate risks is institutionally and politically complex, even though understanding of the Basin's hydro-climate system has improved. Despite decades of research consistently warning of a drying climate, the Basin Plan relied on historical hydrological data to determine future water resource availability. The paper uses the heuristic of the science-policy interface to examine why there were no significant adjustments to account for climate change. This analysis finds that the science-policy interface is highly politicised, with different risk cultures in the scientific, governmental, political and commercial sectors constraining adaptation planning. These constraints need to be overcome because the changing nature of the Anthropocene's rivers means adaptive policy and institutional frameworks are needed that can navigate the complexities, uncertainties and indeterminacies of a changing climate.

The World Economic Forum highlighted-in its 2020 Global Risk Report-that from 2018 to 2020, three of the top five risks with respect to likelihood and impact are climate related with extreme weather events being the highest ranked risk in terms of likelihood. To alleviate the adverse impacts of CID on cities, this paper aims at predicting the occurrence of CID by linking different climate change indices to historical disaster records. In this respect, a deep learning model was developed for spatial-temporal disaster occurrence prediction. To demonstrate its application, flood disaster data from the Canadian Disaster Database was linked to climate change indices data in Ontario in order to train, test and validate the developed model. The results of the demonstration application showed that the model was able to predict flood disasters with an accuracy of around 96%. In addition to its association with precipitation indices, the study results affirm that flood disasters are closely linked to temperature-related features including the daily temperature gradient, and the number of days with minimum temperature below zero. This work introduces a new perspective in CID prediction, based on historical disaster data, global climate models, and climate change metrics, in an attempt to enhance urban resilience and mitigate CID risks on cities worldwide.

Capturing transformation of flood hazard over a large River Basin under changing climate using a top-down approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Decision priority mapping; Flood hazard; Hazard transformation matrix; Hydro-meteorological; Mahanadi River Basin; Model chain setup	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; RAINFALL EXTREMES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CHANGE IMPACTS; DATA-SCARCE; INDIA; PROJECTIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MONSOON; MODELS	Existing flood modeling studies over coastal catchments involving different combinations of model chain setup imparting complex information fails to entail the needs of policy or decision-makers. Thus, a comprehensive framework that pertains to the requirements of practitioners and provides more perspicuous flood hazard information is required. In this paper, a novel approach translating complex flood hazard information in the form of decision priority maps derived using a rational combination of models (physical and statistical) is elucidated at the finest administrative scale. The proposed methodology is illustrated over a highly flood-prone deltaic region in Mahanadi River Basin, India, to characterize impacts of climate change for a 1:100 years return period flood event under future conditions (2026-2055). The modeled flood events are further analyzed to capture the transformation dynamics of flood hazard classes (FHCs) in near-future, for prioritizing areas with greater hazard potential. Interestingly, the results capture a high transformation characteristic from low to high FHCs in agriculture-dominated areas, which are significantly greater than the areas experiencing flood hazard reduction. The results show a significant increase of 12.5% and 27.35% in areas with high FHCs under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Moreover, a notable climate change response is indicated under both climate change scenarios, with approximately 22% (RCP4.5) and 25% (RCP8.5) in villages showing a drastic increment in flood hazard magnitude. The results thus highlight the importance of identifying and prioritizing the areas for flood adaptation where a relative change in flood hazard potential is higher due to climate change. Therefore, we conclude that this study can provide an insight into the implication of new approaches for effective communication of flood information by bridging the gaps between scientific communities and decision-makers in appraisal for better flood adaptation measures.

Modelling past, present and future Ecosystem Services supply in a protected floodplain under land use and climate changes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Protected areas; Ecosystem services trade-offs; InVEST model; Carbon storage; Water flow regulation	CARBON STORAGE; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; TRADE-OFF; RIVER; AREAS; SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; SCENARIOS; IMPACTS	The understanding of protection initiatives' effects on the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ESs) is of paramount importance to attain sustainable management in Protected Areas (PAs). Protected floodplains provide important ESs to local populations such as water flow regulation and climate regulation through carbon storage. This study investigates the effects of biodiversity protection initiatives (i.e. declaration of Protected Areas - PAs) and the related spatio-temporal land use/land cover (LULC) changes on ecosystem services (ESs) in the Nature Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo - NRPB (Central Portugal). Special focus was made on climate mitigation (i.e. carbon storage and sequestration) and water-related (flood mitigation, water regulation and supply) ESs. The analysis was performed using InVEST model. Three dates of past LULC conditions were considered in the analysis (1967, 1990 and 2015). Moreover, two future alternative LULC scenarios for 2050 were designed (a "Business"- BUS and a "Naturalization"- NAT scenario). The BUS scenario considers a LULC distribution towards high productive agricultural systems, considering only a restricted central core of natural areas, while the NAT scenario considers full coverage of natural areas. The two future extreme LULC scenarios were analyzed considering both no climate change and climate change effects on water-related services based on the pessimistic rcp8.5 climatic scenario. The results showed that PA declaration of NRPB after 1980 increased carbon storage-sequestration and flood mitigation (higher water storage, lower recharge and runoff). The analysis of future LULC scenarios demonstrated that the complete renaturing in combination with climate change (reduction of precipitation, increase of temperature) may lead to severe reduction of recharge and runoff. These results indicate that conflicts may appear between specific water regulation services by the application of PA initiatives in places where ground-water resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to be preserved.

In the context of flood mitigation, however, it remains unclear to which degree loss dynamics can be attributed to these causes. We addressed this question based on a record of approximately 12,000 events covering the period between 1962 and 2017, a database containing roughly 120,000 mitigation structures, an inventory of the building stock and 15 climate indices related to hazard triggering conditions. While the indices of triggering precipitation and the number of exposed buildings increased steadily, frequency, magnitude and seasonality of damage-inducing torrential flooding did not show clear trends. This contradiction was attributed to a compensatory effect of the increasing number of technical mitigation structures. Maintaining these structures is of paramount importance to counteract future effects of climate change on the magnitude and frequency of events and the increasing demand for land development in hazard-prone areas.

However, the relationship between temperature and the temporal distribution of precipitation within storms is not well understood, with limited research focus on precipitation event loading or where the bulk of the precipitation occurs within the storm duration. Here, we investigate the relationship between tem-perature and the temporal pattern of precipitation, with a focus on event loading. Historical trend analyses based on station observations reveal that precipitation events have become increasingly front loaded (i.e., a greater percentage of precipita-tion falling earlier in the storm) across Australia over the past six decades. This increased frontal loading of precipitation events coincides with increasing trends in representative storm temperatures, with higher temperatures associated with a greater proportion of short-duration convective events. Linking these precipitation events with the representative storm tem-peratures shows that precipitation events become more front loaded with increasing temperature across nearly all event dura-tions and intensities, with the emphasis on shorter duration (,6 h) events in the tropics. There is a clear systematic shift toward more front-loaded temporal patterns of precipitation with increasing temperature, coupled with intensification of em-bedded bursts. These results have implications for potentially increased flooding, with hydrological applications needing to ac-count for nonstationarity in the temporal pattern of precipitation.

J	Ariyaningsih; Shaw, R				Ariyaningsih; Shaw, Rajib			Community-Based Approach for Climate Resilience and COVID-19: Case Study of a Climate Village (Kampung Iklim) in Balikpapan, Indonesia	LAND			English	Article						climate change; COVID-19; Climate Village; community resilient; community-based approach	ADAPTATION; GOVERNMENT; ENGAGEMENT	COVID-19 and climate change are widely recognized to negatively impact communities in developing countries. Like several other developing countries, Indonesia also dealt with climatic hazards such as flooding and landslides during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, after the Paris Agreement was signed, the government launched a "Climate Village" program or Kampung Iklim (ProKlim) to enhance community contribution in addressing climatic hazard impacts. Yet, numerous studies have researched integrating COVID-19 and climate change impacts, which calls for a concept of community resilience. To bridge this gap, the objective of this research is to understand and measure the local adaptation and mitigation activities in ProKlim through the smart village concept. Methodological literature review, situation analysis through interviews, and field observations are applied in this study. This research used five indicators to measure the current situation of the Climate Village, which are: resilience, mobility, community, perspectives and digitalization. The findings reveal that the implementation of smart villages in ProKlim is still in its preliminary stages and must seek innovation and system integration from smart cities and smart communities. This research also suggests feasible strategies to build community resilience: (i) collaborative governance in the Climate Village program implementation, (ii) promoting the Climate Village program to other sectors for ICT, and (iii) strengthening community participation in implementing the smart village concept.

Flood Risk to Hospitals on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts From Hurricanes and Sea Level Rise	GEOHEALTH			English	Article							SURGE	Hurricanes have caused major healthcare system disruptions. No systematic assessment of hurricane risk to United States hospital-based healthcare delivery has been performed. Here, we show that 25 of 78 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) on the United States Atlantic and Gulf Coasts have half or more of their hospitals at risk of flooding from relatively weak hurricanes. 0.82 m of sea level rise expected within this century from climate change increases the odds of hospital flooding 22%. Furthermore, in 18 MSAs at least half of the roads within 1.6 km of hospitals were at risk of flooding from a category 2 storm. These findings identify previously undescribed risks to hospital-based care delivery in Atlantic and Gulf Coast communities. They suggest that lower intensity hurricanes can have outsized impacts on healthcare access, particularly in places where per capita bed availability is low. Plain Language Summary Hurricanes often incapacitate hospitals, a critical component of healthcare delivery. Climate change is contributing to more intense hurricanes and sea level rise that increase flood risk. Flooding can curtail operations of and limit access to hospitals. We analyzed how hurricane landfalls affect flooding risks to hospitals that serve highly populated cities on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. We find that even relatively weak hurricanes can flood most of the hospitals in urban coastal areas and that sea level rise expected within this century due to climate change significantly increases flooding risk.

However, the increasing rise in sea levels, one of the most impacts of global warming, makes coastal communities much more vulnerable to flooding than before. While most existing work focuses on understanding the large-scale impacts of sea-level rise, this paper investigates parcel-level property impacts, using a specific coastal city, Tampa, Florida, USA, as an empirical study. This research adopts a spatial-temporal analysis method to identify locations of flooded properties and their costs over a future period. A corrected sea-level rise model based on satellite altimeter data is first used to predict future global mean sea levels. Based on high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation data and property maps, properties to be flooded are identified to evaluate property damage cost. This empirical analysis provides deep understanding of potential flooding risks for individual properties with detailed spatial information, including residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, and governmental buildings, at a fine spatial scale under three different levels of global warming. The flooded property maps not only help residents to choose location of their properties, but also enable local governments to prevent potential sea-level rising risks for better urban planning. Both spatial and temporal analyses can be easily applied by researchers or governments to other coastal cities for sea-level rise- and climate change-related urban planning and management.

The urbanization process of the GBA is still ongoing and the meteorological observation resource in the region is rich, making the GBA an ideal testbed for the study of urban climate. In the past decades, the studies on the urban climate in the GBA has been quite active. The topics of these studies can be categorized into 3 topics: (1) urban climate characteristics and variations in the GBA, including significant increase in average temperature, decrease in relative humidity and average wind speed, and more frequent extreme precipitation; (2) challenges brought by urban climate change to GBA, such as the meteorological conditions affecting the atmospheric environment have become more complex, the health risk of urban residents has increased, the risk of urban flash flood and waterlogging has increased, and the demand for urban energy consumption has also increased significantly; (3) technologies and strategies to mitigate and adapt to urban climate change in GBA, including the optimization of urban wind environment, the regulation of urban thermal environment and the response technology of urban flood disaster.

Ports are located in a multi-dimensional environment facing ocean and river hazards. Higher warming scenarios indicate Europe's ports will be exposed to higher risk due to the increase in extreme sea levels (ESL), a combination of the mean sea level, tide, and storm surge. Located on the west Iberia Peninsula, the Aveiro Port is located in a coastal lagoon exposed to ocean and river flows, contributing to higher flood risk. This study aims to assess the flood extent for Aveiro Port for historical (1979-2005), near future (2026-2045), and far future (2081-2099) periods scenarios considering different return periods (10, 25, and 100-year) for the flood drivers, through numerical simulations of the ESL, wave regime, and riverine flows simultaneously. Spatial maps considering the flood extent and calculated area show that most of the port infrastructures' resilience to flooding is found under the historical period, with some marginal floods. Under climate change impacts, the port flood extent gradually increases for higher return periods, where most of the terminals are at high risk of being flooded for the far-future period, whose contribution is primarily due to mean sea-level rise and storm surges.

J	Ortiz, A; Velasco, MJ; Esbri, O; Medina, V; Russo, B				Ortiz, Alejandro; Velasco, Maria Jose; Esbri, Oscar; Medina, Vicente; Russo, Beniamino			The Economic Impact of Climate Change on Urban Drainage Master Planning in Barcelona	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood risk management; drainage planning; cost-benefit analysis	FLOOD RISK-ASSESSMENT; GLOBAL CHANGE; IDF CURVES; DAMAGE; QUANTIFICATION; PRECIPITATION; URBANIZATION; DESIGN	In the context of global change, urban drainage infrastructures must be planned considering future challenges such as new climate change and urban growth scenarios. Large cities require master plans to properly rank and schedule infrastructure development. The flood mitigation measures proposed in previous plans must be revised and updated to address future urban challenges with special regard to climate scenarios. Regarding risk assessment, there is no linear relationship between an increase in rainfall and an increase in risk value. For risk management, the relationship between an increase in rainfall increase and the budget for mitigation measures is even more complex. To investigate this relationship and the economic impact of the aforementioned update, a new plan should be elaborated. Urban drainage master plans have been developed in Barcelona city for the last 50 years. In terms of rainfall, the impact of climate change has been established to be an increase of 7-26% at peak intensity, depending on rainfall duration. The Integral Drainage Master Plan of Barcelona (PDISBA) addresses these new challenges. The modification of rainfall scenario planning and the typology of mitigation measures result in an important rise in investment budget, infrastructure life cycle, and operation and maintenance budgets for said infrastructure. The total cost of the planned measures outlined in the PDISBA has risen to euro1.442 million, nearly double that of the previous plan developed in 2006.

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Macrophytes; Climate change; Nutrient availability; Regime shifts	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER BROWNIFICATION; RIVER FLOODPLAIN; CARBON; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; MACROPHYTE; HYDRILLA; GROWTH; LIGHT; TEMPERATURE	Understanding the roles of eutrophication and CO2 enrichment in the invasive success of aquatic plants is an ecological challenge with relevance to climate change. We tested the hypotheses that (1) eutrophication of freshwaters increases the invasive success of the submersed aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata; (2) CO2-enrichment makes freshwater systems more prone to H. verticillata invasion; and (3) interactions between eutrophication and CO2 enrichment increase the potential of H. verticillata invasion. We carried out a factorial experiment crossing eutrophication (nutrient and phytoplankton addition) and CO2 enrichment to compare the growth attributes of the invasive H. verticillata with those of the native Egeria najas (both Hydrocharitaceae). We found that eutrophication and CO2 enrichment had different effects on growth attributes. Eutrophication decreased the growth rate and lateral branch formation of both species, but the invasive species continued producing more branches than the native one. These results suggest that the invasive species has an increased advantage for spreading under eutrophic conditions. In contrast, CO2 enrichment increased the growth rate and lateral branch formation of both species, but only under eutrophic conditions. Consequently, CO2 enrichment largely counteracted the negative effects of eutrophication on these two macrophytes. Our results indicate that the interaction between freshwater CO2 enrichment and eutrophication may enhance the invasion success of H. verticillata, and potentially other Hydrocharitaceae, due to an increase plant growth and in propagule pressure.

Climate change-related risks and adaptation potential in Central and South America during the 21st century	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Review						central and South America; climate projection; climate change impacts; adaptation; risks	CORAL-REEFS; LATIN-AMERICA; FLOOD RISK; CORDILLERA BLANCA; FIRE MANAGEMENT; WATER-RESOURCES; EXTREME EVENTS; LAND-USE; EL-NINO; IMPACTS	Climate-related risks in Central and South America have received increased attention and concern in science and policy, but an up-to-date comprehensive review and synthesis of risks and adaptation potential is currently missing. For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise, storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation options. Immediate strengthening of policies for building adaptive capacity and increase of research on the risk-adaptation nexus in Central and South America are paramount. Our findings might contribute to guide the adjustment and emphasis of adaptation policies and climate risk management strategies from local to national level.

CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; CMIP5; Hydrological modelling; River flow; Sahel; West Africa	BIAS CORRECTION; SPATIALLY EXPLICIT; NIGER RIVER; MODEL; RAINFALL; WATER; SATELLITE; RUNOFF; EVAPORATION; GROUNDWATER	West Africa and its semi-arid Sahelian region are one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change with a history of extreme climate variability. There is still considerable uncertainty as to how projected climate change will affect precipitation at local and regional scales and the consequent impact on river flows and water resources across West Africa. Here, we aim to address this uncertainty by configuring a regional-scale hydrological model to West Africa. The model (hydrological modelling framework for West Africa-HMF-WA) simulates spatially consistent river flows on a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees grid (approximately 10 km x 10 km) continuously across the whole domain and includes estimates of anthropogenic water use, wetland inundation, and local hydrological features such as endorheic regions. Regional-scale hydrological simulations driven by observed weather data are assessed against observed flows before undertaking an analysis of the impact of projected future climate scenarios from the CMIP5 on river flows up to the end of the twenty-first century. The results indicate that projected future changes in river flows are highly spatially variable across West Africa, particularly across the Sahelian region where the predicted changes are more pronounced. The study shows that median peak flows are projected to decrease by 23% in the west (e.g. Senegal) and increase by 80% in the eastern region (e.g. Chad) by the 2050s. The projected reductions in river flows in western Sahel lead to future droughts and water shortages more likely, while in the eastern Sahel, projected increases lead to future frequent floods.

Exploiting the exogenous variation in rainfall to which children were exposed during the nine months in utero, we find that rainfall variability adversely affects the anthropometric status of children under five years of age in 55 low and middle-income countries. Moreover, the consequences of fetal exposure to rainfall variability are strongly apparent in the child's first year of life and linger to some extent at later ages. Our heterogeneity analyses further show that children of disadvantaged backgrounds, such as poor and uneducated households, are especially vulnerable to rainfall variability during gestation.

Here, we quantify the role of dams in flood mitigation, previously unaccounted for in global flood studies, by simulating the floodplain dynamics and flow regulation by dams. We show that, ignoring flow regulation by dams, the average number of people exposed to flooding below dams amount to 9.1 and 15.3 million per year, by the end of the 21(st) century (holding population constant), for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0, respectively. Accounting for dams reduces the number of people exposed to floods by 20.6 and 12.9% (for RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, respectively). While environmental problems caused by dams warrant further investigations, our results indicate that consideration of dams significantly affect the estimation of future population exposure to flood, emphasizing the need to integrate them in model-based impact analysis of climate change. Global flood risk is assessed in this study; in particular, the authors describe, based on a modeling approach, the positive effect of river dams on mitigating flood hazards to people.

Legal barriers and enablers for reintroducing tides: An Australian case study in reconverting ponded pasture for climate change mitigation	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Blue carbon; Law; Saltmarsh; Agriculture; Ponded pasture	CARBON STOCKS; BLUE CARBON; COASTAL; LAND; ECOSYSTEMS; SERVICES; MANAGE	Across the globe, areas of the floodplain have been converted to agricultural use - often at the expense of natural ecosystems. In Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to 'ponded pasture' for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands, increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds. Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be considered. This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation, using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota.

Preliminary analysis indicates an overall wetter future across India with 290 & PLUSMN; 150 mm to 530 & PLUSMN; 260 mm increase in mean annual precipitation towards end of this century under various climate change scenarios. Apart from the mean precipitation, the extremes are also found to be increasing by alarmingly higher rates. However, the spatio-temporal variations of such increments are notably diverse over different seasons in a year and across different Homogeneous Precipitation Zones (HPZs) in the country. Therefore, a new and more inclusive index, named as Precipitation-based Hotspot Index (PHI), is developed to identify the 'precipitation-based hotspots', i.e. the places with most pronounced changes in precipitation characteristics. The PHI considers the changes in various aspects of precipitation, such as mean, variability, and characteristics of extremes (magnitude, frequency and intensity). Based on the PHI values in the far-future period (2061-2100) and for the worst climate change scenario, the hotspot regions are identified mostly in the northwest, west-central, west coast, and northeast parts of India. Further, considering two important socioeconomic vulnerability factors (population density and human development index) along with PHI, the keyvulnerable tier-I cities are identified across India. The analysis reveals four out of ten tier-I cities will be highly vulnerable towards end of this century. The findings of this analysis (hotspot maps) and the data products (high-resolution, bias-corrected precipitation dataset) are expected to be highly beneficial for impact assessments, hydrologic modelling, and formulating suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies for India over future.

Impacts of climate change on global total and urban runoff	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						sgf-node; llnl; gov; Total runoff; Urban runoff; Climate change; Earth system modeling; Urban hydrology	MODEL; PARAMETERIZATION; RESPONSES	Climate models consistently project that frequency, severity, and duration of hydroclimatic extremes will increase over this century under climate change. Urban flooding and runoff in general have become prominent issues for many cities and regions, arising from a combination of altered precipitation patterns, urban growth, development in floodplains, and increases in impervious surfaces. In this study, we first validate total (grid cell-level) runoff from the fully coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) historical simulations against one observed-runoff/streamflow-based dataset and one reanalysis dataset, and further analyze both grid cell-level runoff and urban subgrid runoff under future climate change scenarios. We calculated global annual average of monthly runoff from the period 1986-1995 for the validation and calculated bias and correlation coefficients between CESM and each of the datasets. Additionally, we analyzed future grid cell and urban runoff across three CMIP6 coupled Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways - 2- 4.5, 3-7.0, and 5-8.5 - and evaluated changes between the future period of 2041-2050 and the same past period of 1986-1995 for each scenario. Results show spatial consistency and robustness between the CESM simulations and both datasets. However, there is some spatial inconsistency in the areas highlighted as major runoff producers, such as the Amazon basin and Southeast Asia, as well as mountainous regions outside the United States. Grid cell-level runoff and urban runoff projections suggest that future hydroclimatic conditions will vary depending on the climate scenario. However, certain locations, such as Madagascar, Indonesia, and the Himalayan mountain range, consistently see decreases in both grid cell-level runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios, and locations such as Nigeria and Ecuador consistently see increases in both grid cell runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios. Our findings provide quantitative insights on hydrology representation in the global Earth system model and advance the understanding of the impacts of large-scale climate change on future local-scale urban runoff.

J	Lee, YJ; Lin, SY				Lee, Yung-Jaan; Lin, Shih-Ying			Effects of Perceptions of Climate Change and Flood Risk on Coping Behavior: A Case Study of Taipei, Taiwan	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						place attachment; mediation effect; moderation effect; climate change perception; flood risk perception; coping behavior	PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIORS; PLACE ATTACHMENT; PREPAREDNESS; DIMENSIONALITY; SATISFACTION; ATTITUDES; IDENTITY; SENSE	Globalization and population growth have put great pressure on the environment over the last few decades, and climate change has increased associated negative effects. Researchers examine the interactions between human and the environment. Among them, the relationship between place attachment and pro-environmental behavior has attracted particular research attention. However, few studies have addressed the relationships among flood risk perceptions, place attachment, and climate change coping behavior in a densely populated urban area. This study examines the effects of perceptions of climate change and flood risk on coping behavioral intention, and determines whether place attachment plays a mediating or moderating role therein in Taipei, the flood-prone capital city of Taiwan. A total of 1208 questionnaires were collected. An analysis of the mediation effects based on a three-level regression model (Phase I) suggested that place attachment is not a mediator. Adjustment of the model and analysis of moderation effects using structural equation modeling (Phase II) suggested no moderation effect. In Phase III, the mediation effect was reexamined, with the replacement of dependent variables (adaptation/mitigation) with high-effort/low-effort coping behaviors, and one dimension of place attachment was replaced with four dimensions thereof (place dependence and place identity, place satisfaction, place affect, place social bonding). The results thus obtained reveal that the paths of place satisfaction exhibit significant mediating effects between attitudes and high-effort coping behavior. Some paths exhibit significant mediating effects between perceptions and low-effort coping behavior through place satisfaction. Another four paths exhibit partial significant mediating effects through place dependence and place identity and place social bonding. These results suggest that affective attachment of people to local places results in a behavioral tendency to protect or improve those places. The main contribution of this study is its support of meta-analyses of the effects of each dimension of place attachment to provide a better understanding of the effects of place attachment on flood risk perception and coping behavior.

Globally, natural catastrophic phenomena and hazards, such as drought, soil erosion, quantitative and qualitative degradation of groundwater, frost, flooding, sea level rise, etc., are intensified by anthropogenic factors. Thus, they present rapid increase in intensity, frequency of occurrence, spatial density, and significant spread of the areas of occurrence. The impact of these phenomena is devastating to human life and to global economies, private holdings, infrastructure, etc., while in a wider context it has a very negative effect on the social, environmental, and economic status of the affected region. Geospatial technologies including Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing-Earth Observation as well as related spatial data analysis tools, models, databases, contribute nowadays significantly in predicting, preventing, researching, addressing, rehabilitating, and managing these phenomena and their effects. This review attempts to mark the most devastating geo-hazards from the view of environmental monitoring, covering the state of the art in the use of geospatial technologies in that respect. It also defines the main challenge of this new era which is nothing more than the fictitious exploitation of the information produced by the environmental monitoring so that the necessary policies are taken in the direction of a sustainable future. The review highlights the potential and increasing added value of geographic information as a means to support environmental monitoring in the face of climate change. The growth in geographic information seems to be rapidly accelerated due to the technological and scientific developments that will continue with exponential progress in the years to come. Nonetheless, as it is also highlighted in this review continuous monitoring of the environment is subject to an interdisciplinary approach and contains an amount of actions that cover both the development of natural phenomena and their catastrophic effects mostly due to climate change.

In this unique populated region, which is characterized by significant gaps in the socio-economic levels particularly between the North (Europe) and South (Africa), parallel with population growth and migration, increased water demand and forest fires risk - the vulnerability of the Mediterranean population to human health risks increases significantly. Indeed, climatic changes impact the health of the Mediterranean population directly through extreme heat, drought or storms, or indirectly by changes in water availability, food provision and quality, air pollution and other stressors. The main health effects are related to extreme weather events (including extreme temperatures and floods), changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases and changes in environmental and social conditions. The poorer countries, particularly in North Africa and the Levant, are at highest risk. Climate change affects the vulnerable sectors of the region, including an increasingly older population, with a larger percentage of those with chronic diseases, as well as poor people, which are therefore more susceptible to the effects of extreme temperatures. For those populations, a better surveillance and control systems are especially needed. In view of the climatic projections and the vulnerability of Mediterranean countries, climate change mitigation and adaptation become ever more imperative. It is important that prevention Health Action Plans will be implemented, particularly in those countries that currently have no prevention plans. Most adaptation measures are "win-win situation" from a health perspective, including reducing air pollution or providing shading solutions. Additionally, Mediterranean countries need to enhance cross-border collaboration, as adaptation to many of the health risks requires collaboration across borders and also across the different parts of the basin.

According to future scenarios, mountain regions are highly vulnerable to climate impacts, including changes in the water cycle (e.g. rainfall extremes, melting of glaciers, river runoff), loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services, damages to local economy (drinking water supply, hydropower generation, agricultural suitability) and human safety (risks of natural hazards). This is due to their exposure to recent climate warming (e.g. temperature regime changes, thawing of permafrost) and the high degree of specialization of both natural and human systems (e.g. mountain species, valley population density, tourism-based economy). These characteristics call for the application of risk assessment methodologies able to describe the complex interactions among multiple hazards, biophysical and socio-economic systems, towards climate change adaptation. Current approaches used to assess climate change risks often address individual risks separately and do not fulfil a comprehensive representation of cumulative effects associated to different hazards (i.e. compound events). Moreover, pioneering multi-layer single risk assessment (i.e. overlapping of single-risk assessments addressing different hazards) is still widely used, causing misleading evaluations of multi-risk processes. This raises key questions about the distinctive features of multi-risk assessments and the available tools and methods to address them. Here we present a review of five cutting-edge modelling approaches (Bayesian networks, agent-based models, system dynamic models, event and fault trees, and hybrid models), exploring their potential applications for multi-risk assessment and climate change adaptation in mountain regions. The comparative analysis sheds light on advantages and limitations of each approach, providing a roadmap for methodological and technical implementation of multi-risk assessment according to distinguished criteria (e.g. spatial and temporal dynamics, uncertainty management, cross-sectoral assessment, adaptation measures integration, data required and level of complexity). The results show limited applications of the selected methodologies in addressing the climate and risks challenge in mountain environments. In particular, system dynamic and hybrid models demonstrate higher potential for further applications to represent climate change effects on multi-risk processes for an effective implementation of climate adaptation strategies.

J	Whitt, C				Whitt, Clayton			From flooded fields to a vanished lake: The politics of broken water cycles in the Bolivian Altiplano	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Bolivia; Climate change; Lake Poopo ?; Water; Drought; Flood	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEOLIBERALISM; GOVERNANCE; MOVEMENT; PROTEST; TRENDS; LIMITS; LIFE	In the floodplains of Bolivia's western highlands, or Altiplano, farmers, herders, and fishers maintain their livelihoods at water-land interfaces that are riddled with disaster risk. This paper draws on 13 months of fieldwork in the region as well as contemporary press accounts to explore water-land disasters in the Desaguadero River floodplain and Lake Poop ' o watershed. My analysis builds on Henri Lefebvre's notion of rhythm to articulate a "politics of cyclic dissonance" - struggles and negotiations surrounding cyclical relationships like rainfall and annual flooding that break apart and leave dangerous consequences in their wake. I analyze two recent cases in Bolivia related to climate change taken from opposite extremes of the water cycle. The first case is the drying of Lake Poop ' o in 2015, an event that garnered headlines around the world as a representation of a drastic impact from climate change. The second case is the struggle of farmers in a community in the Lake Poopo ' watershed to manage flood irrigation in their canal systems without becoming victims of flooding themselves. Both cases illustrate how managing cyclic dissonance is a matter of negotiation, both between people representing different communities, between political constituencies and political leaders, and even between people and the environment, but such politics also works to obscure solutions to environmental problems that emerge from desynchronized cycles.

Temperature rise is mainly due to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), which was increased by approximately 50% since the industrialization period. Here, we review the effect of global climate changes on the alteration of flowering time. High temperature during vernalization delays flowering mainly due to increased expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C and TaVERNALIZATION 2 encoding floral repressors in Arabidopsis and winter wheat, respectively. Increased ambient temperature promotes flowering in many plant species, especially in spring-flowering plants. In Arabidopsis, higher temperature induces SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM)-delta complex that promotes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression. Moreover, high temperatures suppress a floral repressor FLM and disturb the stability of the evening complex that is an inhibitor of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4, which induces FT expression. Drought induces or delays flowering depending on plant species, growing season, and developmental stage. In Arabidopsis, drought induces flowering by promoting the GIGANTEA-CONSTANS (CO) pathway, whereas the stress delays flowering under short-day conditions via ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 1. Plants also alter flowering time to avoid wet conditions, including flooding and precipitation. Increased CO2 concentration accelerates flowering, probably by increasing the rate of photosynthesis. We also reviewed the effect of climate change on pollination.

In order to identify possible causes of flooding in San Jose de Mayo, the factors that favour this phenomenon are analysed at basin level, taking into account climate change and changes in land use. The incidence of the variability of strong rainfall events, accumulated rainfall and productive intensification in relation to the river flow is evaluated in order to understand the occurrence of flooding events in the city. Increases in precipitation were identified in the last 30 years; an association between precipitation and river levels; and also a change in the productive matrix in the territory. Where the processes of soil waterproofing, in the face of climate change, generate a situation of greater vulnerability for the population in flood-prone areas. The importance of creating a territorial strategy at the national level to act in urban flood areas, taking into account the whole basin, is shown.

Chloride content exceeds 250 mg/l and the groundwater is therefore, according to the German Drinking Water Ordinance, not suitable as drinking water. The chloride content in the aquifer originates from early flooding with seawater which occurred during the Holocene sea level rise. Depth and extent of the salinization were mapped by airborne electromagnetic surveys and validated by groundwater analyses. In the transition zone between the marshlands and geest areas, the fresh-saline groundwater interface falls to a depth of > -175 m NHN. Due to the extensive drainage of the marshlands, seepage of fresh groundwater is impeded. Instead, an upconing of the fresh-saline groundwater interface appears due to an upwardly directed hydraulic gradient. Due to climate change, chloride concentrations will increase along the coastlines. Further inland, a decrease of chloride content in near-surface groundwater will occur.

A combined stochastic-analytical modeling methodology to predict spring discharge was developed and demonstrated on the Bukovica spring catchment at the Durmitor National Park, Montenegro. As a first step, climate model projections of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble were selected; and then bias correction was applied based on historical climate data. The regression function between rainfall and peak discharge was established by using historical data. Baseflow recession was described by using a double-component exponential model, where hydrograph decomposition and parameter fitting were performed on the Master Recession Curve. Rainfall time series from two selected RCM scenarios were applied to predict future spring-discharge time series. Bias correction of simulated hydrographs was performed, and bias-corrected combined stochastic-analytical models were applied to predict spring hydrographs based on RCM-simulated rainfall data. Both simulated climate scenarios predict increasing peak discharges and decreasing baseflow discharges throughout the 21st century. The model results suggest that climate change is likely to exaggerate the extremities both in terms of climate parameters and spring discharge by the end of the century both for moderate (RCP 45) and pessimistic (RCP 85) CO2 emission scenarios. To investigate the temporal distribution of extremities throughout the simulated time periods, the annual numbers of flood and drought days were calculated. Annual predicted flood days show an increasing trend during the first simulation period (2021-2050) and a slightly decreasing trend during the second simulation period (2071-2100), according to the RCP45 climate scenario. The same parameter shows a stagnant trend for the RCP 85 climate scenario. Annual predicted drought days show a decreasing trend both for the RCP 45 and RCP 85 climate scenarios. However, the annual number of drought days shows a large variation over time. There is a periodicity of extremely dry years with a frequency between 5 and 7 years. The number of drought days seems to increase over time during these extreme years. The study confirmed that the applied methodology can successfully be applied for spring-discharge prediction and that it offers a new prospect for its wider application in studying karst aquifers and their behavior under different climate-change scenarios.

Children rarely feature in UK policy guidance about how households prepare for floods, and research is limited about children's roles in local resilience building. Using a participatory action research, child-centred methodology we explored (7-9year old) children's knowledge, skills and dispositions in discussions about flooding, suggesting processes for effectively engaging them in Learning for Resilience (LfR). Results suggest children have existing knowledge, skills and dispositions concerning local and international flood risk originating from various sources. They displayed cross-cultural learning, embryonic systems-thinking, and understandings of theirs and others' agency, including adults' reasons for un-preparedness, revealing awareness of risk underestimation and deferral/denial of risk. The paper offers framing of a new taxonomy for young children's significant 'LfR' and seven 'top tips' to facilitate, design and implement learning strategies with children around environmental risk, in the UK and internationally, in climate change contexts.

Numerous studies link post-disaster relocation to adverse social, economic, and health outcomes. However, there is a need to reconsider these relationships in light of accelerating climate change and associated social and policy shifts in the USA, including the rising cost of flood insurance, the challenge of obtaining aid to rebuild, and growing interest in "managed retreat" from places at greatest risk. This article presents data from a survey of individuals who opted either to rebuild in place or relocate with the help of a voluntary home buyout after Hurricane Sandy. Findings show those who lived in buyout-eligible areas and relocated were significantly less likely to report worsened stress than those who rebuilt in place. This suggests access to a government-supported voluntary relocation option may, under certain circumstances, lessen the negative mental health consequences associated with disaster-related housing damage.

Research on how dams and climate change could alter the river has heightened in recent years, and while this research has led to important scientific concepts and increased discussion of sustainable development, it has done little to prevent the rapid environmental change in the Mekong floodplains of Cambodia and Vietnam. Meanwhile, localized drivers of floodplain change (including overfishing, deforestation, and water infrastructure development) are impacting the environment in faster and more direct ways, potentially exacerbating the negative effects of regional factors such as hydropower and climate change. Sustainable development of the basin must include comprehensive science and implementable policy programs that integrate across regional and local scales and focus on clearly defined societal and policy goals, collection of critical data, capacity building of in-region scientific and policy institutions, effective law enforcement, and adaptable implementation strategies.

A recent increase in global wave power as a consequence of oceanic warming	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE SIGNAL; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; EASTERN PACIFIC; WIND-SPEED; REANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; ATLANTIC; TRENDS	Wind-generated ocean waves drive important coastal processes that determine flooding and erosion. Ocean warming has been one factor affecting waves globally. Most studies have focused on studying parameters such as wave heights, but a systematic, global and long-term signal of climate change in global wave behavior remains undetermined. Here we show that the global wave power, which is the transport of the energy transferred from the wind into sea-surface motion, has increased globally (0.4% per year) and by ocean basins since 1948. We also find long-term correlations and statistical dependency with sea surface temperatures, globally and by ocean sub-basins, particularly between the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high south latitudes, the most energetic region globally. Results indicate the upper-ocean warming, a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger. This identifies wave power as a potentially valuable climate change indicator.

Long-term responses to large-scale disturbances: spatiotemporal variation in gastropod populations and communities	OIKOS			English	Article						climate change; global warming; hurricane-induced disturbance; Luquillo Experimental Forest; population dynamics; Puerto Rico; pulse disturbance; press disturbance; succession; tropics	LUQUILLO-EXPERIMENTAL-FOREST; PUERTO-RICO; TERRESTRIAL SNAILS; HABITAT SELECTION; HURRICANE HUGO; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAIN-FORESTS; LAND SNAILS; DYNAMICS; CONSEQUENCES	The Anthropocene is characterized by complex, primarily human-generated, disturbance regimes that include combinations of long-term press (e.g. climate change, pollution) and episodic pulse (e.g. cyclonic storms, floods, wildfires, land use change) disturbances. Within any regime, disturbances occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales, creating complex and varied interactions that influence spatiotemporal dynamics in the abundance, distribution and biodiversity of organisms. Moreover, responses to disturbance are context dependent, with the legacies of previous disturbances affecting responses to ensuing perturbations. We use three decades of annual data to evaluate the effects of repeated pulse disturbances and global warming on gastropod populations and communities in Puerto Rico at multiple spatial scales. More specifically, we quantify 1) the relative importance of large-scale and small-scale aspects of disturbance on variation in abundance, biodiversity and species composition; and 2) the spatial scales at which populations and communities integrate information in the spatially heterogenous environments created by disturbances. Gastropods do not exhibit consistent decreases in abundance or biodiversity in association with global warming: abundance for many species has increased over time and species richness does not evince a temporal trend. Nonetheless, gastropods are sensitive to hurricane severity, spatial environmental variation and successional trajectories of the flora. In addition, they exhibit context dependent (i.e. legacy effects) responses that are scale dependent. The Puerto Rican biota has evolved in a disturbance-mediated system. This historical exposure to repeated, severe hurricane-induced disturbances has imbued the biota with high resistance and resilience to the current disturbance regime, resulting in an ability to persist or thrive under current environmental conditions. Nonetheless, these ecosystems may yet be threatened by worsening direct and indirect effects of climate change. In particular, more frequent and severe hurricanes may prevent the establishment of closed canopy forests, negatively impacting populations and communities that rely on these habitats.

Extreme heat events in the USA are responsible for more deaths as compared to other weather events such as hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes and floods (Luber and McGeehin, 2008) [33]. Heat exposure in buildings has risen due to global warming in conjunction with other factors like urban-ization and associated heat island effects (Kolokotroni et al., 2012) [25], lack of thermal mass (Lomas and Porritt, 2017a) [31], exposure to solar insolation on higher stories, absence of window shading, over-crowding and envelope properties exacerbate the overheating inside the dwellings (Vellei et al., 2017). [45]. Stone et al. specialIntscript [43] provides a macro view of the indoor environments in buildings due to the concurrent event of power outage during heat wave in face of climate change. This paper builds on the previous publication and provides a detailed view of modeling methodology, building physics that explains the sources/sinks of heat and entails a detailed evaluation of the current building stock for the low to moderate income residences in the city of Phoenix, Arizona in terms of their thermal performance. Finite Element models of building stock were simulated using MATLAB for microclimate weather files of Phoenix generated by Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulation. Significant differences in temperature were noted in same building archetypes in different pockets of the city indicating the role of urbanization in aggravating the impact of heat wave. Dwellings with high thermal mass are found to be much more resilient to high ambient temperatures as compared to code compliant residences with base-ments being the coolest zones in all prototypes.

Climate change mitigation potential of wetlands and the cost-effectiveness of their restoration	INTERFACE FOCUS			English	Article						carbon dioxide removal; Paris agreement; ecological restoration; peatland; blue carbon; nature-based solutions	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CARBON; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES	The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 +/- 19.13 gC m(-2) y(-1)) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 +/- 100.6 gCO(2) eq(-1) m(-2) y(-1)). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.

As a region of significant cultural and ecological importance, the transitional area between Taihang Mountain and North China Plain still has a limited understanding of the fluvial landform evolution. With detailed field surveys and 39 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of 14 sections, we reconstruct fluvial landform evolution in the southern piedmont of the Taihang Mountain since the late Pleistocene. The results show that two major fluvial processes occurred during 18-10 ka BP and 9-3 ka BP. Meanwhile, the late Pleistocene-Holocene can be divided into 5 intervals in the alluvial fan and floodplain areas, with corresponding ages of 3 ka BP, 9-3 ka BP, 10-9 ka BP, 18-10 ka BP, and before 20 ka BP, respectively. The results also indicate that the regional fluvial processes primarily result from climate change and tectonic activities, and secondarily result from sea level fluctuation. Additionally, the prehistoric settlement pattern was also shaped by the evolution of regional rivers. Our research is significant for understanding the evolution and mechanisms of fluvial landforms in transitional zones.

Associated water resource development has come with a heavy price for the Basin's freshwater ecosystems degrading them over decades. Australian governments are attempting to achieve environmental sustainability by returning water to the environment through buy-back of irrigation licences and improved water efficiencies. To determine effectiveness, basin-wide management objectives were established for key indicators, including waterbird populations and life histories which can effectively indicate ecosystem function and condition, driven by flow and flooding regimes. Ongoing monitoring of waterbird numbers indicates continued declines. We evaluated the feasibility of meeting established waterbird objectives under existing and predicted climates. We modelled long-term waterbird numbers using one of the world's largest ongoing waterbird surveys (1983-2020), covering about 13.5% of the area of the entire Basin. Our findings suggest that under near future climate change projections, waterbird numbers will likely continue to decline, and remain below restoration targets set for the Basin. We discuss the current policy settings for using environmental water to support waterbird populations, recommending adjustments to restore the Basin's waterbird populations and their wetlands in order to meet Australia's conservation targets in relation to the ongoing global crisis of biodiversity loss.

Using high-resolution climate change information in water management: a decision-makers' perspective	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						adaptation; high-intensity rainfall; flood risk	BIAS CORRECTION; EXTREME RAINFALL; CHANGE IMPACTS; FLOOD RISK; MODEL; ENGLAND; UK; UNCERTAINTY; ADAPTATION; RESOURCES	The UK Climate Change Act requires the Environment Agency to report the risks it faces from climate change and actions taken to address these. Derived information from projections is critical to understanding likely impacts in water management. In 2019, the UK published an ensemble of high-resolution model simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2 km) projections can resolve smaller scale physical processes that determine rainfall and other variables at subdaily time-scales with the potential to provide new insights into extreme events, storm runoff and drainage management. However, simulations also need to inform adaptation. The challenge ahead is to identify and provide derived products without the need for further analysis by decision-makers. These include a wider evaluation of uncertainty, narratives about rainfall change across the projections and bias-corrected datasets. Future flood maps, peak rainfall estimates, uplift factors and future design storm profiles also need detailed guidance to support their use. Central government support is justified in the provision of up-to-date impacts information to inform flood risk management, given the large risks and exposure of all sectors. The further development of projections would benefit from greater focus and earlier scoping with industry representatives, operational tool developers and end users. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.	[Orr, H. G.; Charlton, M. B.; Peat, K.

However, factors like climate change and increasing complexity within our urban systems call into question the viability of current approaches to and implementation of design storm criteria moving forward. This paper seeks to identify design practices and strategies that are well-suited for the increasingly complex and rapidly changing contexts in which our cities and infrastructure are operating. We posit that the advancement of a multi-scalar perspective on resilience will be increasingly necessary in response to the growing challenges our cities and infrastructure face. At the scale of single components/sub-systems, return periods (or similar criteria) will likely remain a necessary element of the design process. At the scale of the entire system(s), approaches like safe-to-fail, robust decision making, and enhanced sensing and simulation appear well suited for complementing existing approaches by more explicitly considering failure consequences in the design and management processes. Ultimately, this paper seeks to spur continual research and advancement of these topics in order to facilitate the evolution of the design storm process for an increasingly complex and non-stationary world.

This study proposes a multicriteria inventory classification while planning green infrastructure for resilient stream ecosystems under extreme weather events. Literature reviews, expert surveys, and reliability/validity analyses were used to enlist indicators for this classification. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP) were used to compute the weights and ranks of indicators for identifying critical indices while planning green infrastructure. The AHP and fuzzy AHP analysis suggested that meteorological phenomena and disasters, hydraulic characteristic of streams, land use/geographic characteristics, and experience/damage restoration were important factors. High weights were attributed to aquatic ecology, potentially vulnerable areas, population, topography, and heat waves. The weights and ranks attributed by AHP and fuzzy AHP varied slightly, but the indicator groups with high and low weights were the same; hence, primary indicators to be considered while planning green infrastructure for resilient stream ecosystems could be suggested. These results could be used as a preliminary analysis in establishing countermeasures against climate change or in distributing budgets for green infrastructure plans.

Weather Fluctuations, Expectation Formation, and Short-Run Behavioral Responses to Climate Change	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						Weather fluctuation; Climate change adaptation; Expectation formation; Agricultural production	IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE; WATER AVAILABILITY; IMPACT; MODELS; ADAPTATION; YIELDS; FLOOD	One premise adopted in most previous studies is that weather fluctuations affect economic outcomes contemporaneously. Yet under certain circumstances, the impact of weather fluctuations in the current year can be carried over into the future. Using agricultural production as an example, we empirically investigate how past weather fluctuations affect economic decision-making by shifting agents' subjective expectations over future climate. We find that agricultural producers do not form expectations on future climate using only long-run normals, and instead engage in a combination of heuristics, including the availability heuristic and the reinforcement strategy. Adopting these learning mechanisms causes farmers to significantly over-react to more recent fluctuations in weather and water availability when making ex ante acreage and crop allocation decisions.

Much of the economic literature suggests that uncertainty reduces investment, but the theory of risk-induced extraction suggests the opposite. In this paper, we test this theory in the context of political violence, which poses a real threat of state destabilization and violent expropriation of property rights. Facing this uncertainty, we find that oil producers in the Middle East and North Africa increase oil production in response to political violence. This finding has important negative consequences for the world in terms of climate change and demonstrates a previously untested mechanism through which exhaustible resource supply is flooding the market.

Alteration to the urban micro-climate due to global climate change impacts may also exacerbate the situation in future. Sustainable urban stormwater management using low impact development (LID) techniques, along with conventional urban stormwater management systems, can be implemented to mitigate climate-change-induced flood impacts. In this study, the effectiveness of LIDs in the mitigation of urban flood are analyzed to identify their limitations. Further research on the success of these techniques in urban flood mitigation planning is also recommended. The results revealed that LIDs can be an efficient method for mitigating urban flood impacts. Most of the LID methods developed so far, however, are found to be effective only for small flood peaks. They also often fail due to non-optimization of the site-specific and time-varying climatic conditions. Major challenges include identification of the best LID practices for the region of interest, efficiency improvements in technical areas, and site-specific optimization of LID parameters. Improvements in these areas will allow better mitigation of climate-change-induced urban floods in a cost-effective manner and will also assist in the achievement of sustainable development goals for cities.

In 2018-2019, Central European forests were hit by two consecutive hotter drought years, an unprecedented phenomenon that is likely to occur more frequently with climate change. Here, we examine tree growth and physiological stress responses (increase in carbon isotope composition; Delta delta C-13) to this consecutive drought based on tree rings of dominant tree species in a Central European floodplain forest. Tree growth was not reduced for most species in 2018, indicating that water supply in floodplain forests can partly buffer meteorological water deficits. Drought stress responses in 2018 were comparable to former single drought years but the hotter drought in 2018 induced drought legacies in tree growth while former droughts did not. We observed strong decreases in tree growth and increases in Delta delta C-13 across all tree species in 2019, which are likely driven by the cumulative stress both consecutive hotter droughts exerted. Our results show that consecutive hotter droughts pose a novel threat to forests under climate change, even in forest ecosystems with comparably high levels of water supply.

To achieve the objective, four scenarios were developed in order to simulate changes in peak runoff, inundated volume, and the performance of existing drainage systems. The findings revealed that as urbanization increased from 10% to 70%, the inundated volume of nodes and peak runoff increased from 35,418 to 52,118 x 103 m3 and 89.4-111.96 m3/ s, respectively. Furthermore, the peak runoff in response to climate change is increased by 46.9%, 34.8%, and 37.5%, respectively, as a result of the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model version 4 (RCA4), Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO22T), and the hydrostatic version of the regional model (REMO2009). Overall, the findings showed that existing drainage systems were unable to collect and convey the amplified inundation from different simulated scenarios, and the Welmel sub-city to roundabout was threatened by increased flooding, causing significant damage to properties and infrastructure. The implemented LIDs are capable of reducing the expected peak runoff, flooding magnitude, and flooded junctions in climate change and urbanization scenarios; however, combining both mitigation measures can further reduce the study area. The imple-mentation of a mitigation strategy with adequate drainage systems will be required to mitigate the flooding risks in Robe town.

Despite this consensus, little is known about potential changes in the variability of ecohydrological conditions, which is also required to inform climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. Considering potential changes in ecohydrological variability is critical to evaluating the emergence of trends, assessing the likelihood of extreme events such as floods and droughts, and identifying when tipping points may be reached that fundamentally alter ecohydrological function. Using a single-model Large Ensemble with sophisticated terrestrial ecosystem representation, we characterize projected changes in the mean state and variability of ecohydrological processes in historically snow-dominated regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Widespread snowpack reductions, earlier snowmelt timing, longer growing seasons, drier soils, and increased fire risk are projected for this century under a high-emissions scenario. In addition to these changes in the mean state, increased variability in winter snowmelt will increase growing-season water deficits and increase the stochasticity of runoff. Thus, with warming, declining snowpack loses its dependable buffering capacity so that runoff quantity and timing more closely reflect the episodic characteristics of precipitation. This results in a declining predictability of annual runoff from maximum snow water equivalent, which has critical implications for ecosystem stress and water resource management. Our results suggest that there is a strong likelihood of pervasive alterations to ecohydrological function that may be expected with climate change.

J	Ahn, KH; Kim, YO				Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Kim, Yong-Oh			Incorporating climate model similarities and hydrologic error models to quantify climate change impacts on future riverine flood risk	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Quantifying uncertainty; Climate change; Hydrologic response	UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; WATER-RESOURCES; FREQUENCY; ENSEMBLE; HETEROSCEDASTICITY; AUTOCORRELATION; PROJECTIONS; GENERATION; PREDICTION; STREAMFLOW	Quantifying uncertainty in projecting climate change impact on flood frequency analysis is particularly relevant for long-term water resources planning and management. This study examines uncertainties arising from (1) a climate model, with and without accounting of intermodel similarities, (2) a hydrological model with two different error model definitions, which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on flood response. Through a Bayesian modeling framework, a proposed statistical framework is utilized to explore various definitions of sources of uncertainty and to develop a series of nested formulations that can evaluate the leverage of specific uncertainty sources in quantiles of future streamflow. To be specific, climate model similarity, hydrologic prediction error, and frequency analysis are formally modeled with an appropriate likelihood function. The quantiles inferred by each formulation are compared in a case study of the Yongdam Basin in Korea. Results indicate that variance in hydrologic response is underestimated if climate model similarities are ignored, and in many cases, the inferred quantiles of streamflow projection are biased accordingly. Furthermore, a simple error model used in defining hydrologic uncertainty may create incorrect information in determining the quantiles in streamflow projection. The approach presented here of quantifying uncertainty has the potential to better depict overall multi-source uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on hydrologic response. Finally, our results also indicate that careful flood planning management may be required for the Yongdam Basin in future summers.

This effect will be exacerbated by the sea level rise induced by climate change. The present work determines the vulnerability to erosion and flooding along 55 beaches grouped in different coastal archetypes, representative of the Catalan coast. The vulnerability assessment has been done through the numerical simulation of different combinations for projected waves and mean water levels under present conditions and the climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the year 2100. A storm event approach has been used to determine coastal flooding and erosion with return periods of 50, 100, and 500 years using the XBeach numerical model. Results show that shoreline retreat is not the best proxy to characterize the erosion. The low-lying nature of the coast, the non-presence of well-developed berms, and the existence of river mouth and torrents govern the coastal flooding. The sea level rise appears to be a dominant variable in coastal hazards.

African heritage sites threatened as sea-level rise accelerates	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE	Many heritage sites are threatened by rising sea levels under climate change as they lie within the coastal zone. A continental assessment of exposure of 284 African heritage sites shows that 20% of sites are currently at risk, which more than triples under moderate and high emission scenarios. The African coast contains heritage sites of 'Outstanding Universal Value' that face increasing risk from anthropogenic climate change. Here, we generated a database of 213 natural and 71 cultural African heritage sites to assess exposure to coastal flooding and erosion under moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Currently, 56 sites (20%) are at risk from a 1-in-100-year coastal extreme event, including the iconic ruins of Tipasa (Algeria) and the North Sinai Archaeological Sites Zone (Egypt). By 2050, the number of exposed sites is projected to more than triple, reaching almost 200 sites under high emissions. Emissions mitigation from RCP 8.5 to RCP 4.5 reduces the number of very highly exposed sites by 25%. These findings highlight the urgent need for increased climate change adaptation for heritage sites in Africa, including governance and management approaches, site-specific vulnerability assessments, exposure monitoring, and protection strategies.

Flood insurance is a driver of population growth in European floodplains	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION MEASURES; PROTECTION; AMENITIES; MIGRATION; LOSSES	Future flood risk assessments typically focus on changing hazard conditions as a result of climate change, where flood exposure is assumed to remain static or develop according to exogenous scenarios. However, this study presents a method to project future riverine flood risk in Europe by simulating population growth in floodplains, where households' settlement location decisions endogenously depend on environmental and institutional factors, including amenities associated with river proximity, riverine flood risk, and insurance against this risk. Our results show that population growth in European floodplains and, consequently, rising riverine flood risk are considerably higher when the dis-amenity caused by flood risk is offset by insurance. This outcome is particularly evident in countries where flood risk is covered collectively and notably less where premiums reflect the risk of individual households. This study finds that flood insurance policy design affects economic development in floodplains and, consequently, flood risk in Europe. Therefore, the authors advocate for flood insurance design to be integrated in climate change adaptation policy.	[Tesselaar, Max; Botzen, W. J. Wouter; Tiggeloven, Timothy; Aerts, Jeroen C. J.

The impact of climate change on maize chemical defenses	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Review							ELEVATED CARBON-DIOXIDE; JASMONIC ACID; FUSARIUM-VERTICILLIOIDES; PLANT DEFENSE; CELL-WALL; VOLATILES; BIOSYNTHESIS; ACCUMULATION; METABOLITES; EMISSION	Climate change is increasingly affecting agriculture, both at the levels of crops them-selves, and by altering the distribution and damage caused by insect or microbial pests. As global food security depends on the reliable production of major crops such as maize (Zea mays), it is vital that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate these negative impacts. To do this a clear understanding of what the impacts are and how they occur is needed. This review focuses on the impact of climate change on the production and effectiveness of maize chemical defenses, including volatile organic compounds, terpenoid phytoalex-ins, benzoxazinoids, phenolics, and flavonoids. Drought, flooding, heat stress, and ele-vated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, all impact the production of maize chemical defenses, in a compound and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, changes in stomatal conductance and altered soil conditions caused by climate change can impact environmental dispersal and effectiveness certain chemicals. This can alter both defen-sive barrier formation and multitrophic interactions. The production of defense chemicals is controlled by stress signaling networks. The use of similar networks to co-ordinate the response to abiotic and biotic stress can lead to complex integration of these networks in response to the combinatorial stresses that are likely to occur in a changing climate. The impact of multiple stressors on maize chemical defenses can therefore be different from the sum of the responses to individual stressors and challenging to predict. Much work remains to effectively leverage these protective chemicals in climate-resilient maize.

However, in recent years, we have faced extreme phenomena such as fires, floods, excessive temperatures, etc. which affect our physical and mental condition and the environment, often leading to significant material damage. To understand these problems and highlight the meteorological and phenomenological changes encountered in the last decade, time series were web-scraped and analyzed from several open data sources: weather news broadcast in Romania, air quality, temperature, etc. The extraction and organization of data recorded between 2009 and 2023 are formulated as a framework that can be reproduced and replicated to continue the monitoring. The exploratory analysis of the categorical and numerical data highlights intricate patterns and correlations within meteorological conditions across regions and seasons. From temperature trends to air quality fluctuations, the study underscores the dynamic interplay of weather phenomena, paving the way for informed forecasting and deeper climate research. At the same time, data processing includes Latent Dirichlet Allocation, K-prototype clustering analysis, in addition to K-means clustering with dimensional reduction techniques, all of which are employed to further reveal the extreme phenomena in news and regions with higher occurrence. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data processing framework for multiple datasets and analytics, extracting valuable information on climate change and identifying the exposed regions to extreme phenomena.

Scientists' warning on climate change and insects	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Review						arthropods; conservation; ecology; evolution; extreme events; global warming; temperature	BARRO COLORADO ISLAND; SIMULATED HEAT WAVES; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; LAND-USE CHANGE; THERMAL TOLERANCE; CHANGE IMPACTS; GLOBAL CHANGE; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS	Climate warming is considered to be among the most serious of anthropogenic stresses to the environment, because it not only has direct effects on biodiversity, but it also exacerbates the harmful effects of other human-mediated threats. The associated consequences are potentially severe, particularly in terms of threats to species preservation, as well as in the preservation of an array of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity. Among the most affected groups of animals are insects-central components of many ecosystems-for which climate change has pervasive effects from individuals to communities. In this contribution to the scientists' warning series, we summarize the effect of the gradual global surface temperature increase on insects, in terms of physiology, behavior, phenology, distribution, and species interactions, as well as the effect of increased frequency and duration of extreme events such as hot and cold spells, fires, droughts, and floods on these parameters. We warn that, if no action is taken to better understand and reduce the action of climate change on insects, we will drastically reduce our ability to build a sustainable future based on healthy, functional ecosystems. We discuss perspectives on relevant ways to conserve insects in the face of climate change, and we offer several key recommendations on management approaches that can be adopted, on policies that should be pursued, and on the involvement of the general public in the protection effort.

Coastal cities in small island developing states in the Caribbean stand to be among the most climate-impacted. This paper explores vulnerability to coastal hazards (sea-level rise, storm surges and flooding) in Barbados' capital city and its urban corridor-Greater Bridgetown. Specifically, it is a qualitative survey of climate change vulnerabilities and human adaptation in the study domain that is underpinned by three research questions: 1) In what ways is Greater Bridgetown vulnerable to coastal hazards? 2) What are the human dimensions of this vulnerability? and 3) What are the associated human adaptations? We apply a four-component adaptive urban governance framework to explore the role of the city's historical development, urban morphology, national-level institutions and relevant government and other stakeholder initiatives in shaping, reducing and/or increasing vulnerability to coastal hazards. The paper relates primarily to the governance dimension of the risk reduction framework articulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In totality, a case is presented that highlights Greater Bridgetown's capacity for coastal/urban resilience, but which cannot be maximized without institutional prioritization of vulnerability, increased stakeholder "buy-in" and participation, along with significant investment in adaptation and the protection of valuable coastal infrastructure. The findings are of relevance to human adaptation within coastal cities of small island developing states.

As a result of climate change and human activities, the incidence and impact of drought have grown in China. Timely and effective monitoring of drought is crucial for water resource management, drought mitigation, and national food security. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive drought index (YCDI) suitable for the Yellow River Basin using principal component analysis and the entropy weight-AHP method, which integrated a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and standardized water storage index (SWSI). SWSI is calculated by the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), which can more comprehensively reflect the impact of surface water resources on drought (as compared with soil moisture-based indexes). The study results showed that: (1) compared with single drought index, YCDI has stronger ability to monitor drought process. In terms of time scale and drought degree, the monitoring results based on YCDI were similar with data presented in the China Flood and Drought Bulletin and Meteorological Drought Yearbook, reaching similar to 87% and similar to 69%, respectively. The correlation between drought intensity and crop harvest area was 0.56. (2) By the combined analysis of the Mann-Kendall test and Moving T test, it was found that the abrupt change of YCDI index at the time of 2009, mainly due to the precipitation in 2009 reached the lowest value in the past 30 years in northern China and extreme high temperature weather. (3) The YCDI of Henan and Shandong provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the basin decreased more significantly, with the maximum value reaching 0.097/yr, while the index in the upper reaches showed an increasing trend with the maximum rate of 0.096/yr. (4) The frequency of mild drought, moderate drought, severe drought and extreme drought in the Yellow River basin during the study period was 15.84%, 12.52%, 4.03% and 0.97%, respectively. Among them, the highest frequency of droughts occurred in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and central Shaanxi provinces. Drought causation in the Yellow River basin is more influenced by human activities than climate change in the middle and lower reaches, while climate change is the main factor in the upper reaches. Overall, YCDI is a reliable indicator for monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of drought in the Yellow River basin, and it can be used for monitoring soil moisture changes and vegetation dynamics, which can provide scientific guidance for regional drought governance.

These processes are substantially affected by climatic change, with long-term and severe droughts on the one hand, and high intensity rainstorms and devastating floods on the other hand. Simultaneously, land-use change and mismanagement practices have led to processes of accelerated soil erosion, depletion of soil organic carbon pools, and the degradation of extensive drylands. Forestry has been accepted as an effective means for restoring degraded drylands, and for attaining a range of regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services. Specifically, forestry is widely perceived as an effective means for soil erosion control, organic carbon sequestration, microclimate improvement, and climate change mitigation. However, forestry in drylands often proves to generate substantial environmental challenges, resulting in deterioration of ecosystem functions and health. The objective of this essay is to review the challenges and opportunities induced by dryland afforestation and reforestation, and highlight the need to attain climate-smart strategies for establishing and managing these land-uses. Particularly, tree species invasion and allelopathy, which are common in dryland forestry projects, jeopardize species richness and diversity of native vegetation communities. Further, the challenges linked with tree invasiveness necessitate predicting the distribution of potentially invasive species and foreseeing their impacts on the recipient ecosystems under projected climate change scenarios. The effect of allelopathy is significant under limited water availability conditions and is expected to be determined by the expanding drylands and intensifying aridity worldwide. Therefore, judicious selection of tree species should not only focus on ones with high water-use efficiency, low flammability, high pest resistance, and fast growth, but also on low invasiveness and allelopathic capacities. Insights of this essay may be used by land managers, stakeholders, and policy makers involved in environmental development of drylands.

They are sensitive to climate change and typically have high ecological and environmental quality levels due to minimal human disturbance. This study aimed to quantify landscape pattern changes within the Nagqu Hangcuo National Wetland Park (NNWP) and identify the impact of climate on wetland change. Using remote sensing data from six periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015), dynamic change analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and correlation analysis were employed to determine the evolutionary features of the wetland landscape and explore their relationship with climatic factors. The results showed that the total wetland area increased from 15.11 km(2) in 1990 to 15.23 km(2) in 2015. The meadow area increased the most among landscape types, primarily converted from swamps. Over 25 years, the fragmentation of the NNWP's landscape increased while diversity decreased and its shape became more complex. Meadows were more sensitive to climatic factors than other landscape types, with correlation coefficients between wetland separation and sunshine duration being more significant than other climatic factors. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor landscape pattern changes and the effects of climate change to better protect wetland parks through long-term planning, suitable mechanisms, and advanced technology.

To this end, a multi-disciplinary framework is established by integrating climate science, hydrology, and electric power network analysis. The framework quantifies the effect of climate change on flood hazard levels in a levee-protected area and the subsequent changes in the resilience of the electric power network. In the first step, the changes in the exposure of levee-protected regions to flooding hazard in a warming climate are calculated. Then, the probabilities of failure of power network components due to flooding under current and projected future climate are determined. Finally, the power system resilience index is used to assess the system resiliency for pre-flooding (baseline), historic flooding, and two projected future flooding scenarios. For demonstration, the proposed framework is applied to a levee-protected area in Northern California. The IEEE 118-bus standard test system is employed to represent the power network in the study area. Results reveal that climate change can considerably decrease the system resilience of the levee-protected electric power network. The findings of this study can contribute towards more resilient power network systems under a changing climate.

To understand the flood impacts in Taiwan caused by increasing rainfall due to global warming, this study adopts a high-resolution atmospheric model (HiRAM) under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario to project future changes in flood impact. For the flood simulation, the SOBEK flood model was used to determine the maximum accumulated flooding depth and flood probability in the two periods of the present and the middle of the 21st century. Yilan County, one of the most flood-prone areas in Taiwan, was chosen as a demonstration case for the development of flood impact maps. According to the results of flood map application, flooded areas were predicted to increase in the middle period of the 21st century due to increasing rainfall, especially in paddy fields, maricultural farms, and stock farms. From the base period to the middle of the 21st century, the area of flooding impacts was projected to increase from 24% to 40% in paddy fields, from 9% to 15% in maricultural farms, and from less than 1% to 9% in stock farms. These results show that the development of flood maps can help elucidate the actual impacts of climate change in Taiwan and serve as a scientific basis for adaptation actions.

This study aimed to analyze projected changes in length of rainy season (LRS), and rainfall extreme indices at the Vea catchment, Ghana. The analysis was performed using high-resolution simulated rainfall data from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model under moderate greenhouse gas emission scenario for the period 2020-2049 relative to 1981-2010 period. LRS was computed from the difference between rainfall onset and cessation dates, and its trends were assessed using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Annual rainfall intensity and frequency indices were computed. Results showed an increase in mean LRS from 168 to 177 days, which was at a rate of 1 day/year in the future (2020-2049). The LRS increase would be more significant at northern and south-western parts of the catchment. Rainfall intensity and frequency indices are projected to increase at spatial scale across the catchment. Projected changes in rainfall extremes could increase the frequency and intensity of drought and flood events. Thus, it is necessary to integrate suitable climate change adaptation measures such as rainwater harvesting, flood control measures, and development of early warning systems in the planning process by decision-makers at the catchment.

Here we use 50 high-resolution climate simulations from the single model initial condition large ensemble CRCM5-LE to examine two such compound event types in southern Norway: (1) Heavy rainfall on saturated soil during the summer months (June, July, August, September; SES) and (2) Concurrent heavy rainfall and snowmelt (rain-on-snow; ROS). We compare present-day conditions (1980-2009) with future conditions under a high-emission scenario (2070-2099) and investigate the impact of climate change on the frequency and spatial distribution of SES and ROS events. We find that the probability of occurrence of SES events during the summer increases by 38% until 2070-2099 over the whole study area. The areas with the highest occurrence probability extend from the west coast into the interior. In contrast, the frequency of ROS is projected to decrease by 48% on average, largely driven by decreases in snowfall. Moreover, the spatial pattern of ROS are projected to change, with the most frequently affected areas shifting from the west coast towards the inner country. Our study highlights the benefits of single model large ensemble simulations for the analysis of compound events.

J	Umgiesser, G				Umgiesser, Georg			The impact of operating the mobile barriers in Venice (MOSE) under climate change	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Venice lagoon; Climate change; Finite elements; Numerical modeling; Mobile barriers (MOSE); Flux reduction	LAGOON; DYNAMICS	A 2D hydrodynamic model has been applied to simulate the operations of the mobile barriers in Venice (MOSE) under climate change, and more specifically under rising sea levels. Three years have been simulated with varying sea levels to assess the impact on the number and length of the closings and the reduction to the water fluxes through the inlets due to the rising of the barriers. The uncertainty of the water level forecast is taken into account by using actual forecast data for the years 2000-2002. Sea level rise (SLR) is simulated in 10 cm increments from 0 (situation of today) to 200 cm. Results show that the barriers will be able to keep the water level below the safeguarding level of 110 cm nearly all of the time if SLR does not exceed 50 cm. However, with a SLR of 50 cm the barriers will be closed on average once a day, and with a SLR of 75 cm the lagoon will be on average more hours closed than open. The flux reduction at the inlets are quite moderate (10 % for a SLR of 50 cm). Finally, partial closures are shown to be ineffective for the flood defense of the city and only a complete closure will guarantee a noticeable reduction of the water levels in the lagoon.

J	Fazel-Rastgar, F; Sivakumar, V				Fazel-Rastgar, Farahnaz; Sivakumar, Venkataraman			A case study of an extreme flooding episode in Charikar, Eastern Afghanistan	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						Afghanistan; Charikar; climate change; flash floods; severe weather	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; RISK; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; REANALYSIS; TRENDS; WINTER; STORM	This work investigates the meteorological mechanisms forming a classical frontal system on 26 August 2020 in the northeast and eastern parts of Afghanistan. The weather system caused heavy rainfall and led to severe flash floods. Flooding, affected by torrential rain showers, struck mostly the city of Charikar in Parvan province early in the morning day, while most people were asleep. This caused 150 deaths, and nearly 500 houses were destroyed. This research explores atmospheric processes by examining the National Centers for Environmental Prediction dataset and MERRA Model database. The calculation of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and Showalter index extracted from the Skew-T log-pressure diagram shows a high value of the CAPE at around 2,632 J/kg and -6.6 for the Showalter index, respectively. This presents a very extreme instability in the study area during the time of the flood. The study reveals that the triggering of this system was mostly by thermodynamical aspects, low-level deep convergence, and local topographical aspects rather than the PV streamer. However, the anomaly climate analysis for different atmospheric elements with a comparison of the climate normal values shows the importance of climate change in the weather system into a stronger frontal activity associated with stronger baroclinicity over the study area.

This scenario requires developing specific flooding vulnerability mitigation strategies that improve local knowledge of flood-prone areas at the urban scale and supersede the traditional hazard approach based on the classification of riverine buffers. Moreover, decision-makers need to adopt performance-based strategies for contrasting climate changes and increasing the resilience of the system. This research develops the recent Flooding Risk Mitigation model of InVEST (Integrated Evaluation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-off), where cloudburst vulnerability results from the soil's hydrological conductivity. It is based on the assumption that during cloudburst events, all saturated soils have the potential for flooding, regardless of the distance to rivers or channels, causing damage and, in the worst cases, victims. The model's output gives the run-off retention index evaluated in the catchment area of Turin (Italy) and its neighborhoods. We evaluated the outcome to gain specific insight into potential land use adaptation strategies. The index is the first experimental biophysical assessment developed in this area, and it could prove useful in the revision process of the general town plan underway.

Building Resilience through Flood Risk Reduction: The Benefits of Amphibious Foundation Retrofits to Heritage Structures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE			English	Article						Amphibious architecture; buoyant foundation retrofit construction; Charleston South Carolina; climate change adaptation; cultural heritage protection; Farnsworth House; flood risk reduction; freedman's cottage; historic preservation; Princeville North Carolina		Today, many older coastal, riverine, and deltaic communities are faced with increasing flood risk, often combined with a rise in sea levels or land erosion. Until now, the options available to owners of heritage properties have been limited. Buoyant foundation retrofits offer under-resourced communities a viable and affordable adaptation alternative to buy-outs, tear-downs, and "displacement by climate change". Amphibious strategies will not solve all challenges related to the increased impacts of climate change on heritage architecture, but offer a resilient option for communities to protect their physical history and cultural identity. This paper will provide an overview of amphibious retrofit construction and its application to the preservation of historic buildings and neighborhoods. It will provide several case study examples, namely, retrofits of heritage buildings in the historically significant African-American community of Princeville, North Carolina; for a low-income neighborhood of freedman's cottages in Charleston, South Carolina; and a creative approach for amphibiating architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's iconic Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois. It will connect to larger themes of developing innovative and practical methods for providing flood protection to heritage structures, using an approach that emphasizes sensitivity and adaptability to the cultural values of existing communities.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly implemented to help local communities adapt to climatic hazards. However, the relevance of their location in relation to those hazards and local NCP has hardly been addressed. In the PORTAL (Pathways of Transformation in the Alps) project, we identified and mapped a portfolio of 97 NbS for climate change adaptation in the European Alps. Most NbS addressed drought or soil instability and aimed to provide multiple NCP simultaneously such as wood production and protective function against landslides. We analysed whether NbS are located where they are the most needed, according to both current and future intensity of the hazards they aim to address and to supply-flow-demand indicators of the NCP they aim to provide. We found that the location of NbS is not overall related to current supply-flow-demand indicators of most NCP, nor to the intensity of hazards. Nevertheless, NbS addressing droughts and floods are located in areas where these hazards are more intense, but do not match higher values for NCP indicators. Conversely, NbS aiming to produce wood and to provide protective function against landslides are located in areas with greater levels of these NCP, regardless of the intensity of hazards. These results suggest that hazards and NCP indicators are not the main drivers of NbS implementation. We argue that integrating local climate conditions and current NCP flows is needed to underpin a macro-regional strategy for planning NbS implementation.

Significant changes in air temperature, precipitation, and humidity are expected in future due to climate change. The influence of climate change on flood hazards is subject to considerable uncertainty that comes from the climate model discrepancies, climate bias correction methods, flood frequency distribution, and hydrological model parameters. These factors play a crucial role in flood risk planning and extreme event management. With the advent of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6, flood managers and water resource planners are interested to know how changes in catchment flood risk are expected to alter relative to previous assessments. We examine catchment-based projected changes in flood quantiles and extreme high flow events for Awash catchments. Conceptual hydrological models (HBV, SMART, NAM and HYMOD), three downscaling techniques (EQM, DQM, and SQF), and an ensemble of hydrological parameter sets were used to examine changes in peak flood magnitude and frequency under climate change in the mid and end of the century. The result shows that projected annual extreme precipitation and flood quantiles could increase substantially in the next several decades in the selected catchments. The associated uncertainty in future flood hazards was quantified using aggregated variance decomposition and confirms that climate change is the dominant factor in Akaki (C2) and Awash Hombole (C5) catchments, whereas in Awash Bello (C4) and Kela (C3) catchments bias correction types is dominate, and Awash Kuntura (C1) both climate models and bias correction methods are essential factors. For the peak flow quantiles, climate models and hydrologic models are two main sources of uncertainty (31% and 18%, respectively). In contrast, the role of hydrological parameters to the aggregated uncertainty of changes in peak flow hazard variable is relatively small (5%), whereas the flood frequency contribution is much higher than the hydrologic model parameters. These results provide useful knowledge for policy-relevant flood indices, water resources and flood risk control and for studies related to uncertainty associated with peak flood magnitude and frequency.

The natural flow regime of the LR is critical to sustain native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; however, it has been changing due to the combined effect of climate change and human activities. Accurate quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on changes in the flow regime is a prerequisite for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection. This study aims to evaluate climate- and human-induced impacts on the LR during 1980-2014. A distributed hydrological model CREST-snow combined with remote sensing and streamflow data and the Budyko framework were jointly used to address this scientific question during three time windows determined by the Mann-Kendall test and the history of dam construction. Results show that compared with the baseline period (1980-1986) when no dam was constructed, significant changes (similar to- 6%) in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987-2014, particularly after 2008 when the construction of the largest hydropower plant (Nuozhadu) in the Mekong River basin began. Climatic change contributed similar to 57% to streamflow changes during the transition period (1987-2007), whereas human activities contributed similar to 95% during the post-impact period (2008-2014). At the seasonal scale, climatic variation plays a more significant role during the dry season (December-May), with precipitation the most important factor among climate variables, whereas human activities contributed more during the wet season (June-November), benefiting the downstream areas through mitigating floods. Among human activities, reservoir construction is a dominant factor affecting streamflow over agricultural, industrial, and domestic water uses. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological changes in the LR basin that may impact the Lower Mekong River, serve as a basis for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection, and highlight the need for considering reservoir operation strategies in streamflow projections in similar basins globally under climate change scenarios.

However, few available hydrological modelling packages can simulate complex, dynamic, manually operated reservoir control structures. We present SHETRAN-Reservoir, a physically-based spatially distributed modelling tool to simulate catchment hydrology, including reservoir operations. We also propose a method for deriving parsimonious reservoir operation rules from real-world observations. Application of SHETRANReservoir to the Upper Cocker catchment in the Lake District National Park, UK, is shown to improve modelling of hydrological response. Modelling combined climate change and water resource management scenarios demonstrates the influence of operational control rules on hydrological impacts, especially during droughts.

Long-term development and planning require predictions of low-probability high-consequence storm surge levels that account for climate change impacts. This requires simulating thousands of synthetic storms under a specific climate change scenario which requires high computational power. To alleviate this burden, we developed a machine learning-based predictive model. The training data set was generated using a high-fidelity hydrodynamic model including the effect of wind-generated waves. The machine learning model is then used to predict and compare storm surges over historical (1980-2000) and future (2080-2100) periods, considering the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Our analysis encompassed 57 locations along the New York and New Jersey coastlines. The results show an increase along the southern coastline of New Jersey and inside Jamaica, Raritan, and Sandy Hook bays, while a decrease along the Long Island coastline and inland bays.

Here we show that the latest generation of coupled climate models robustly project an intensification of very rainfall-intense seasons (June-September). Under the shared socioeconomic pathway SSP5-8.5, very wet monsoon seasons as observed in only 5 years in the period 1965-2015 are projected to occur 8 times more often in 2050-2100 in the multi-model average. Under SSP2-4.5, these seasons become only a factor of 6 times more frequent, showing that even modest efforts to mitigate climate change can have a strong impact on the frequency of very strong rainfall seasons. Besides, we find that the increasing risk of extreme seasonal rainfall is accompanied by a shift from days with light rainfall to days with moderate or heavy rainfall. Additionally, the number of wet days is projected to increase.

This paper explores the impacts of extreme heat and flooding on water and electricity services in Accra and Tamale, Ghana. Interviews with water/electricity providers and water quality analysis are combined with household interviews, focus group discussions and observations conducted in eight low-income urban settlements. The findings highlight the interconnected nature of service provision during extreme weather events, with challenges in one sector reinforcing problems in another, exacerbating difficulties with access. Although households can utilize rainwater during flooding, it is highly susceptible to faecal contamination, and electricity supplies are often disconnected. During extreme heat, demand for water and electricity outstrips supply, leading to severe shortages, especially in Tamale. Water and electricity service providers should consider their interconnected nature and adopt a joined-up approach to cope with extreme weather events, which are predicted to increase with climate change.

Moreover, quantifying the combined effects of future climate variations and human-made infrastructures, e.g., dams and reservoirs, poses a significant challenge. In this study, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case study in the Srepok River Basin-a tributary of the Mekong River Basin. Here, we aim to reveal the impacts of various climate change scenarios and the effects of reservoir operations in this region. Our findings indicate that 1) the projected annual streamflow is anticipated to increase by a minimum of 9.2% (2046-2065) and could peak at an increase of 14.9% (2080-2099) under the highest greenhouse gas emissions, 2) Srepok 4, Srepok 3, and Buon Kuop demonstrate a higher capability for mitigating flood peaks and managing seasonal flow in the downstream floodplain, whereas Buon Tua Srah shows the least performance, and 3) reservoirs operated with annual regulation have more pronounced impacts than those regulated on a daily schedule. Our work provides i) a scientific foundation for regional stakeholders and decision-makers to develop sustainable strategies that address the combined effects of reservoir operation and future climate, and ii) it supports national authorities and officials in resolving conflicts related to transboundary rivers within the Mekong River Basin.

Flooding affects above- and belowground ecosystem processes, representing a substantial threat to crop productivity under climate change. Plant-associated fungi play important roles in plant performance, but their response to abnormal rain events is unresolved. Here, we established a glasshouse experiment to determine the effects of flooding stress on the spring wheat-mycobiota complex. Since plant phenology could be an important factor in the response to hydrological stress, flooding was induced only once and at different plant growth stages, such as tillering, booting and flowering. We assessed the wheat mycobiota response to flooding in three soil-plant compartments (phyllosphere, roots and rhizosphere) using metabarcoding. Key soil and plant traits were measured to correlate physiological plant and edaphic changes with shifts in mycobiota structure and functional guilds. Flooding reduced plant fitness, and caused dramatic shifts in mycobiota assembly across the entire plant. Notably, we observed a functional transition consisting of a decline in mutualist abundance and richness with a concomitant increase in plant pathogens. Indeed, fungal pathogens associated with important cereal diseases, such as Gibberella intricans, Mycosphaerella graminicola, Typhula incarnata and Olpidium brassicae significantly increased their abundance under flooding. Overall, our study demonstrate the detrimental effect of flooding on the wheat mycobiota complex, highlighting the urgent need to understand how climate change-associated abiotic stressors alter plant-microbe interactions in cereal crops.

This analysis of regional narratives of ice loss exposes the contested role of glacial meltwater amongst local residents, framing glaciers not just as physical features but also as nodes of discourse and imagination that influence climate change adaptation. Peru's Cordillera Blanca offers an excellent case study for this new narrative approach to shrinking glaciers. The Cordillera Blanca hosts 25 percent of Earth's tropical glaciers, has hundreds of glacial lakes and has generated some of the world's deadliest glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Despite decades of glacial lake management in the Cordillera Blanca, government agencies, researchers, local people and hydroelectric companies often disagree as to how to safely manage these lakes to prevent floods and maintain water security. This study helps explain why they disagree and why social conflict has repeatedly occurred around Lakes Palcacocha and Shallap. It analyzes narratives embedded in local and national newspapers and other media to understand varying views. Frequently, competing visions of glacial lake risk management stem from power structures that prioritize certain narratives over others in response to perceived political and environmental conditions. Thus, narrative analysis offers a methodology to understand local and regional experiences with glacier change and climate adaptation, including how and where environmental authority emerges, with broader implications for a global politics of ice loss.

To understand the influence of natural factors (e.g. climate change, flooding, drought) and human activities (e.g. agriculture) as well as to support management strategies, reconstructions of past vegetation and environmental changes are needed. To achieve this, we conducted a multi-proxy paleoecological analysis, including pollen and spores, macro-charcoal and radiocarbon dating, on a sediment core taken from a riparian area in the Harapan forest of Sumatra. Three distinct periods were identified: i) AD 1100 - 1400: Upland and swamp forest with riparian and herbaceous vegetation, possibly part of a riparian buffer zone (e.g. riverbank), was present in the study area under a stronger dry season regime; ii) AD 1400 - 1870: freshwater swamps expanded to the study site; iii) later, from AD 1870 to present, upland forests dominated in the study area with a strong dry season. The presence of cereal cultivation from AD 1300 - 1450, and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) since the mid-19th century AD indicates the presence of small-scale agriculture in the study area. This study of riparian vegetation dynamics and environmental changes in the Harapan forest of Sumatra shows the development from a riparian forest to a freshwater swamp and upland forest under the impact of climate change and human activities.

These water shifts threaten all life on earth.2. Societies' safe and reliable water accessibility faces growing uncertainty from climate change; however, water crisis communication may inadvertently remind audiences of their mortality. According to terror management theory, these mortality reminders can hinder pro-environmental efforts in humans and even increase intergroup biases- a significant challenge for developing environmental solutions. While climate change has been examined as a mortality reminder, water remains untested.3. We presented participants with either a mortality -laden message, an aversive but not - life-threatening message, or one of three threatening water-related messages- experiencing drowning, dehydration or contaminated water consumption- to determine if the water-related messages function similarly to the mortality message.4. Some (e.g. drowning; contaminated water), but not all (e.g. dehydration), water messages increased death-thought accessibility, which could lead to paradoxical environmental behaviours, depending on the audience. Our research findings should inform policymakers, non-profit organizations and other water correspondents' communication strategies.5. As some threatening water messages elicit similar responses to known mortality reminders, the way water crises are framed is important for water-related decision-making and ensuring equitable, successful pro-environmental outcomes.

Then a consensus statement from the Regional Action on Climate Change Symposium warned: "the Earth's climatic, ecological, and human systems are converging towards a crisis that threatens to engulf global civilization within the lifetimes of children now living." Since then, the consequences of a broad set of extreme climate events (notably droughts, floods, and fires) have been compounded by interaction with impacts from multiple pandemics (including COVID-19 and cholera) and the Russia-Ukraine war. As a result, new connections are becoming visible between climate change and human health, large vulnerable populations are experiencing food crises, climate refugees are on the move, and the risks of water, food, and climate disruption have been visibly converging and compounding. Many vulnerable populations now face serious challenges to adapt. In light of these trends, this year, RACC identifies a range of measures to be taken at global and regional levels to bolster the resilience of these populations in the face of such emerging crises. In particular, at all scales, there is a need for globally available local data, reliable analytic techniques, community capacity to plan adaptation strategies, and the resources (scientific, technical, cultural, and economic) to implement them. To date, the rate of growth of the support for climate change resilience lags behind the rapid growth of cascading and converging risks. As an urgent message to COP27, it is proposed that the time is now right to devote much greater emphasis, global funding, and support to the increasing adaptation needs of vulnerable populations.

In this study, the effect of climate change on 24-h probable maximum precipitation (PMP24) was investigated in a part of the Qareh-Su basin located in the Southeast of Caspian Sea. So far, there have been no estimates of the hydrometeorological PMP values under climate change conditions in the study area. For this purpose, the climatic data were applied during the years 1988-2017. To generate future data, the outputs of the CanESM2 (Second Generation Canadian Earth System Model) model as a general circulation model (GCM) under optimistic (RCP2.6), middle (RCP4.5), and pessimistic (RCP8.5) emission scenarios, and statistical downscaling model (SDSM) were used in the near (2019-2048) and the far (2049-2078) future periods. The PMP24 values were estimated using a physical method in the baseline and future periods under the three scenarios. The PMP24 value was estimated about 143 mm for the baseline period, using a physical approach. These values were 98, 105, and 109 for the near-future and 129, 122, and 126 mm for the far-future period. The results showed that the physical approach's PMP24 values tend to fall at 14-38%. Overall, the PMP24 values decrease in the future, and the rate of PMP decrease in the near-future was more than the rate of the far-future. The spatial distribution maps of PMP24 in the baseline and future periods showed that the PMP24 values decreased from west to east.

Metropolitan areas with higher property value and population density than rural areas need practical strategies to reduce flood damage. Therefore, this study aims to perform an inundation analysis of coastal urban areas under a climate change scenario. Changwon city is one of the typical coastal metropolitan regions in South Korea. Severe flooding has occurred in this area caused by a combination of precipitation and sea-level rise enhanced by the typhoon, Sanba, in September 2012. At that time, daily precipitation was 65.5 mm, which is lower than the capable amount of rainfall of the drainage system. However, the river stage combined with the tidal wave caused by a typhoon and heavy precipitation exceeded the flood warning level. This study performed the flood inundation analysis for a part of Changwon city using the SWMM model, a two-dimensional urban flood analysis model. Furthermore, we considered the climate change scenarios to predict the potential flood damage that may occur in the future. As a result, as the future target period increases, both the flooding area and the inundation depth increase compared to the results of the inundation simulation according to the current precipitation and sea-level conditions. The inundation area increased by 2.6-16.2% compared to the current state, and the flooded depths would be higher than 1 m or more. We suggest a structural method to reduce inundation damages to consider extreme precipitation and tidal wave effects.

J	Lim, CH; Kim, HJ				Lim, Chul-Hee; Kim, Hyun-Jun			Can Forest-Related Adaptive Capacity Reduce Landslide Risk Attributable to Climate Change?-Case of Republic of Korea	FORESTS			English	Article						landslide; adaptive capacity; climate change; forest disaster; machine learning	SOUTH-KOREA; RAINFALL	Recent cases of climate disasters such as the European floods in 2021 and Korea's longest rainy season in 2020 strongly imply the importance of adaptation to climate change. In this study, we performed a numerical prediction on how much climate change adaptation factors related to forest policy can reduce climate disasters such as landslides. We focused on the landslide in Korea and applied a machine learning model reflecting adaptive indicators in the representative concentration pathway 8.5 climate scenario. The changes in the landslide probability were estimated using the Random Forest model, which estimated the landslide probability in the baseline period (2011) with excellent performance, and the spatial adaptation indicators used in this study contributed approximately 20%. The future landslide risk predicting indicated a significant increase in the Very High and High risk areas, especially in 2092. The application of the forest-related adaptation indices based on the policy scenario showed that in 2050, the effect was not pronounced, but in 2092, when the risk of landslides was much higher, the effect increased significantly. In particular, the effect was remarkable in the Seoul metropolitan and southern coastal regions. Even with the same adaptive capacity, it exerted a larger effect on the enhanced disasters. Our results suggest that the enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce landslide risk up to 70% in a Very High risk region. In conclusion, it implies an importance to respond to the intensifying climate disasters, and abundant follow-up studies are expected to appear in the future.

Scenario-based field experiments with small- and medium-sized firms in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Private sector adaptation; Climate change; Flood response; Small; and medium-sized firms; Field experiments; Vietnam	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXPERIMENTAL VIGNETTE; MANAGING CLIMATE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; RESPONSES; BUSINESS; SMES; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE	Adaptive governance approaches emphasize the crucial role of the private sector in enabling climate change adaptation. Yet, the participation of local firms is still lacking, and little is known about the conditions potentially influencing firms' adaptation decisions and mechanisms that might encourage private sector engagement. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of the willingness of manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate financially in collective flood adaptation in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), a hotspot of future climate change risk. Using scenario-based field experiments, we shed light on internal and external conditions that influence potential investments in collective initiatives and explain what role SMEs can play in flood adaptation. We find that direct impacts of floods, perceived self-responsibility, and strong local ties motivate firms to participate in collective adaptation, whereas government support, sufficient financial resources, and previously implemented flood protection strategies reduce the necessity to act collectively. Here, opportunity costs and the handling of other business risks play a decisive role in investment decisions. This study shows that although private sector engagement appears to be a promising approach, it is not a panacea. Collective initiatives on flood adaptation need formal guidance and should involve local business networks and partnerships to give voice to the needs and capacities of SMEs, but such initiatives should not overstretch firms' responsibilities.

We developed biome classifications based on current climate for the coterminous United States using the Holdridge Life Zone system to assess potential change on DoD lands. We validated classifications using comparisons to existing ecoregional classifications, the distribution of major forest types, and tree species in eastern North America. We projected future life zones for mid- and late-century time periods under three greenhouse gas emission scenarios (low-B1, moderate-A1B, and high-A2) using an ensemble of global climate models. To assess installation vulnerability (n = 529), we analyzed biome shifts using spatial cluster analysis to characterize interregional variation, and identified representative installations for subsequent landscape-level analyses. Although mean annual temperatures are expected to increase, installations located in the Northeast, Lake States, and western Great Plains are likely to experience the largest proportional increases in temperature. Accordingly, forest and grassland communities at these installations managed to support a wide range of training, and environmental objectives may be adversely affected by altered disturbance regimes, heat, and moisture stress. However, precipitation is projected to increase in the Northeast and Lake States mitigating some effects of increased temperatures on biological communities. Given the uncertain response to climate change in different ecoregions, additional environmental and stewardship attributes are needed within a decision-support framework to understand vulnerabilities and provide appropriate responses.

Due to climate change, it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate-induced hydrologic variation. Therefore, the local high-density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model (HMS) through a fully coupled reservoir module. We then apply the extended HMS in a one-way coupled mode to the bias corrected Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in East Asia (CORDEX-EA) regional climate simulations under two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the PLB, with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability, flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049. The local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin. Despite that, much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season, while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk. The approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change, and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale.

The Yangtze River basin is one of the world's largest basins, and understanding future climate changes is vital for water resource management and supply. Research on predicting future climate change in the upper Yangtze River basin (UYRB) and introducing machine learning algorithms to analyze the impact of climate factors, including extreme weather indicators, on surface runoff is urgently needed. In this study, a statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was used to forecast the future climate in the UYRB, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) or modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test at a 5% level of significance was applied to analyze temporal trends. The Spearman rank correlation (SRC) test at a 5% level of significance and random forest regression (RFR) model were employed to identify the key climatic factors affecting surface runoff from annual precipitation, annual temperature, maximum 5-day precipitation (Rx5Day), number of tropical nights (TR), and consecutive dry days (CDD), and the RFR model was also used to predict future runoff. Based on the results, we found that, compared to the selected historical period (1985-2014), the mean annual precipitation (temperature) during the mid-term (2036-2065) increased by 18.93% (12.77%), 17.78% (14.68%), 20.03% (17.03%), and 19.67% (19.29%) under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively, and during the long term (2071-2100), increased by 19.44% (12.95%), 22.01% (21.37%), 30.31% (30.32%), and 34.48% (37.97%), respectively. The warming and humidification characteristics of the northwestern UYRB were more pronounced. The key climatic factors influencing surface runoff were annual precipitation, maximum 5-day precipitation (Rx5day), and annual temperature. Because of warming and humidification, surface runoff in the UYRB is expected to increase relative to the historical period. The surface runoff during the mid-term (long term) increased by 12.09% (12.58%), 8.15% (6.84%), 8.86% (8.87%), and 5.77% (6.21%) under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The implementation of sustainable development pathways under the low radiative forcing scenario can be effective in mitigating climate change, but at the same time, it may increase the risk of floods in the UYRB.

Heavy rainfall has led to severe urban flooding, disrupting human life and causing widespread damage. This study aims to examine the impacts, preparedness, and adaptation strategies related to monsoon flooding in Lahore, Pakistan's second-most populous metropolitan area. Using Yamane's sampling method, a total of 370 samples were surveyed and analyzed using descriptive analysis and chi-square tests. The results indicate that houses and parks were the most commonly damaged properties, with common impacts including roof collapse, house fires, seepage, and wall dampness. These impacts not only caused physical damage but also disrupted basic amenities and damaged roads, resulting in significant socioeconomic costs. Despite these challenges, residents adopted a variety of adaptation strategies such as the use of temporary tarps, moving household appliances to upper floors, and shifting to tiled floors and wall paneling to mitigate damage. However, the study highlights the need for further measures to reduce flood risks and promote adaptation planning in order to effectively address the ongoing challenges posed by climate change and urban flooding.

WATER			English	Article						floodings; climatic change; human impact; Ionian coast; Southern Italy	LANDSLIDES; APENNINES; DYNAMICS; GULF	The Ionian coast of the Basilicata region, southern Italy, is characterized by a remarkable archaeological heritage, valuable crops, and national and international tourism, contributing significantly to the regional economy. In the last two decades, the area has been affected by the heavy recurrence of flooding events, which caused significant damage to agriculture, tourist infrastructure, and archaeological heritage. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of pluviometric, hydrometric, and erosion/deposition dynamics of main rivers have been carried out in order to investigate the role played by natural factors, climate changes, and human activity. The results show that flooding events in the Metaponto plain were certainly caused by extreme rainy events, but man has also played an important role. The Metaponto plain has been involved in a reclamation consisting of the building of an extensive channel network, which provided better land cultivation, easy access to the beaches, and archaeological heritage protection. The human impact related to the absence of channel cleaning has proved to be the most relevant factor that greatly amplified the effects of low-intensity rainfall events, thus triggering flooding events.

The raw historical (1971-2000) and near future (2021-2050) precipitation and temperature data were obtained from Middle East and North Africa domain of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The projections from the global climate model were corrected using daily observations from in situ stations and then used as inputs for SWAT+ hydrological model to forecast daily streamflow under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario at the near future period. Flood frequency analysis at each period was accomplished and floodway and floodway fringe were obtained through flood wave routing along the river and a multi-criteria decision-making approach, respectively. The results indicated that the climate model typically underestimates the temperature and precipitation values at the historical period and the future projections need to be adjusted. In addition, a significant decrease in total runoff volume in the future periods is expected; however, the hydrologic models showed that the number and magnitude of peak flows would be increased.

We argue that environmental justice (EJ) can deepen MOS' engagement with social equity in addressing grand challenges, particularly climate change. Through a bibliometric analysis and qualitative review, we explore scholarly communities within EJ literature and draw connections to MOS research. We develop three bridges between EJ and MOS scholarship: (a) investigating organizational roles and processes in distributing environmental benefits and burdens within socioecological systems, (b) situating the firm within structural and historical contexts that create and perpetuate environmental injustices, and (c) prioritizing the goals, perspectives, and agency of activists and neglected voices within environmental conflicts and solutions. Ultimately, this review aims to build meaningful pathways to embed EJ in MOS research on grand challenges.

Warming temperature linked to atmospheric enrichment in CO2 of anthropogenic origin, affects aquatic and terrestrial environments, modifies marine biotope, explains devastating droughts, storms, floods and fires. It changes biodiversity, bio-invasions specially concerning vector-borne diseases. Cardiac, respiratory and metabolic diseases, allergies and cancers are strengthened by increasing atmospheric particles. Managing heat waves requires adapting emergency services and preventive measures upstream. Children, elderly or socially deprived people are mostly exposed. As a whole the animal world is undergoing by climatic change for which humans are responsible. To improve human and animal health, reducing pollution and CO2 enrichment appears as a still possible ambition, involving decarbonation of the economy and changes in behavior.

The LARS-WG6 model was employed to simulate the meteorological data obtained from Rasht Meteorological Station under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios for the 2020-2050 and 2060-2090 periods. The simulated values were assessed based on the measured values of total biomass and grain yields using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the relative error parameters, and the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn). The calculated values of RMSE. varied from 7 to 4% for grain yield and from 3 to 7% for biomass yield at the calibration and validation stages, respectively. The results suggested that the AquaCrop model had suitable accuracy in predicting biomass and grain yields. The findings indicate that climate change decreased mean rice grain yield by 17 to 23% under the RCP4.5 scenario and by 18 to 23% under the RCP8.5 scenario for 2050 and 2090, respectively, in non-flooded irrigation management. The lowest simulated mean biomass and grain yields were obtained under irrigation at 11-day intervals in scenario RCP8.5 for the second future period (2060-2090). In general, non-flooded irrigation management had negative effects on rice grain yield under climate change. Moreover, the mean rice growing period under both RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios declined by 2090. These findings can be used for a broad spectrum of users such as farmers, agricultural engineers, and project managers in practical policymaking and making correct decisions compatible with the region in order to increase rice grain yield productivity under future climate conditions in northern Iran.

This study addresses this challenge by assessing how coastal adaptation is being financed and implemented in Spain. In the absence of a detailed roadmap for implementing the Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change, we have analysed how adaptation has been and is currently being funded; which the rationale for investments along the territory is; how adaptation investments compare to regular coastal protection costs; and assessed when implemented measures are really adaptation ones Our results show that the financing source clearly conditions the type of measures implemented, with those funded under the Environment Promotion Plan for Climate Change Adaptation (PIMA Adapta initiative) being dominated by classical coastal engineering actions, whereas ecosystem-related actions are mostly funded under the LIFE programme. In territorial terms, the Mediterranean coastal regions present the most important problems under current conditions and attract most of the funding. Most of the funded actions have been designed to solve current coastal problems, and although they indirectly contribute to adaptation by improving the coastal base status, they are not specifically designed for climate change. This misuse of the concept of adaptation measure will tend to the society to be overconfident about adopted actions whereas we are not progressing to real adaptation. To overcome this risk, it is necessary to have a clear roadmap for implementing adaptation measures together a proper financing structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under the influence of climate change, compound flooding is likely to be intensified. In this paper, using the main urban area of Haikou City as an example, we developed an event-based statistical-numerical hybrid framework to investigate the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and future rainfall changes on compound flood risk. Future rainfall was predicted by using five global climate models (GCMs) in CMIP5. A combination of GCMs and IPCC AR5 was used to predict the future SLR. The copula was then used to calculate the probabilistic risk of compound flooding (OR joint probability and failure probability) for historical and future scenarios, and the numerical model was utilized to evaluate the risk of inundation under historical and future scenarios. The probabilistic risk results show that both the probability and the failure probability of compound flooding will increase in the future. Output from GCMs indicate that when the OR event of the 5-year event (the compound flooding when at least one of the 5-year rainfall and the 5-year water level happens) occurs, the joint probability of future compound flooding will likely increase to 37.5%. The numerical model results indicate that the flood extent, flood depth and flood duration will increase under the influence of future rainfall and SLR. Under the impact of climate change, the flood depth in the FS5 case will increase by 22.85% and the flood extent in the FS5 case will increase by 41.42% compared to HS5. By controlling for variables, we also find that the combined impact of future changes in rainfall and water level on the magnitude of flooding is greater than the sum of their individual impacts. Finally, we find that water storage facilities and tide gates could be set up to mitigate compound flooding under climate change.

These climatic hazards caused extensive livestock loss and worsen livelihood of pastoralists' households. Pastoralists are higher vulnerable to these climate shocks and livestock major source of their nutrition and income. This research work focused to analyze the factors affecting resilience of pastoral community in Punjab province of Pakistan. Understanding shocks of climate change in historical perspective of pastoral community, consultation for key information, and focus group discussions were managed. The study collected data of 768 pastoral households' regarding pastoral shocks experience, long-term adaptation measures, and coping strategies through external support for resilience upright. Principal component analysis was used for construction of resilience index of pastoral households. In estimating institutional factors, adaptive practice and socio-demographic effects on pastoral households' resilience structured probit regression were employed in the study. Extension services access, availability of adequate formal credit, pastoral household income, schooling years and adaptive practice like afforestation, the practice of ethno-veterinary, improved stock breeding, beekeeping, enclosures, and grazing of crop fields post-harvest affect significantly and positively in developing pastoral household resilience to shocks. In the past scenario long-term adaptation strategies, policy measures ignored, while investment priority was focused on risk-reducing measures. To enhance long-run pastoral household resilience status regarding climate change shocks, there is need for direct investment to increase adaptive capacity pastoral community.

Impacts of these changes are rapid permafrost thaw and melt of glaciers, increased flooding, extreme weather events leading to sudden changes in biodiversity, increased forest fires, more insect pest outbreaks, and increased emissions of CO2 and methane. These trends interact with sociological changes leading to land-use change, globalisation of diets, impaired health of Arctic Peoples, and challenges for transport. Local mitigation and adaptation measures are likely to be limited by a range of public perceptions of climate change that vary according to personal background. However, Siberia has the possibility through land surface feedbacks to amplify or suppress climate change impacts at potentially global levels. Based on the diverse studies presented in this Ambio Special Issue, we suggest ways forward for more sustainable environmental research and management.

Flood insurance helps to cope with the risk of flooding, but take-up rates are relatively low in many places. Mainly in developing countries, index-based flood insurance - where the insurer's payout is based on pre-agreed weather indices instead of actual loss - has been marketed recently. In this paper, we investigate whether the introduction of index-based flood insurance with relatively low premiums is likely to attract new customers in a high-income country, namely Germany. We use data from a discrete choice experiment combined with damage data for a major flood in 2013. We find index-based flood insurance to attract similar customers as traditional damage-based, while the latter is preferred on average. Our results suggest that not many new customers would enter the market, once index-based flood insurance were available.

The main project solution (an integrated early warning system, IEWS) is implemented as a technical and adaptive means to reduce exposure and vulnerability of urban assets and citizens to climate change. IEWS considers major climate change-induced hazards such as floods, combined sewer overflows, storm surges, heatwaves, cold waves, snowfalls, windstorms, air pollution and forest fires. The IEWS platform is built on top of existing infrastructure such as meteorological and weather services, drainage infrastructure monitoring systems and official information channels. It is a multi-risk approach, in contrast with classic sectorial solutions which focus on just one hazard at a time. This paper describes the objectives of the project, the architecture of the IEWS, the methodology used for its validation and the expected results and benefits for the city of Badalona.

It argues that a better understanding of people's moral and psychological functioning toward ecology could guide the creation of more suitable environmental management strategies. The study is based on semi-structured interviews investigating the environmental values of urban inhabitants; the interviews were conducted in 2018, in a coastal French area affected by recurring floods. Our results showed no significant relationships among the three studied factors of experiencing natural hazards, becoming aware of sustainable issues and developing intentions to 'act green'. In fact, these last two aspects depended mainly on informal education and socio-economic conditions. Using a `heuristic of fear' (Jonas 1984) to develop sustainability practices is therefore inefficient, at best. Instead, practical efforts should be centred on upbringing, education, self-efficacy and socio-economic and political regulations, especially in a country like France where people are historically used to welcoming collective regulations by the Welfare State.

To this end, climate projections based on a five -member transient climate change simulation ensemble, performed using a state-of-the art regional climate model, spanning the 1991-2050 period, corresponding to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emis-sion scenario are used. A reanalysis-driven simulation for the 1991-2010 period compared against available observations confirm suitability of the model for application in climate change simulations. Assessment of projected changes to mine-relevant climate variables that are important from structural integrity and operation perspectives reveal potential vulnerabilities and opportunities. Active layer thickness increases in the 0.3-2 m range in permafrost regions, coupled with increases in flood probability, as reflected in snow-melt rate increases in the 0.14-6.77% range and increases in the 100-year return levels of daily maximum rainfall in the 5-50% range, suggest potential impacts on the structural integrity of mine infrastructure, such as slope instability and foundation settlement of tailings dams, and supporting infrastructure such as ice/all-season roads. Increases in soil moisture, projected in the 0-11% range, at a few mines, suggest potential impacts on material handling systems, such as increases in the traction factor of the muck-haul and tire rolling resistance, that can lead to low productivity. Projected increases to wind speeds in the 5-10% range for the northernmost regions suggest po-tential impacts on the tailings management facility in terms of increases in tailings resuspension. Overall, this study identified northernmost and northeastern mines to be more vulnerable, with air/soil temperature, pre-cipitation and wind speed being the most influential climate variables. This systematic study, for the first time, has identified potential vulnerabilities of northern Canadian mines, which can inform future high-resolution climate modelling and detailed at-site climate-mine interaction studies that is required for climate-change adaptation related decision-making.

Climate change over this region could potentially impact agricultural production, water resources management, and the overall economy of the country. We used six regional climate models (RCMs) over the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment South Asia domain. We used one medium stabilization scenario (RCP4.5) and one high-emission scenario (RCP8.5) for projecting the extreme rainfall indices. A multi-model ensemble mean was generated using the BMA approach. The BMA mean is a weighted average related to each RCM's predictive skill during the training period. Most of the rainfall extremes are expected to increase in both pre-monsoon (March-May) and monsoon (June-September) seasons in the future compared with baseline (1976-2005). The average pre-monsoon rainfall of the study area is projected to increase by 12.93 and 18.42% under RCP4.5 and 18.18 and 23.85% under RCP8.5 for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2099, respectively. The average monsoon rainfall of the study area is projected to increase by 4.96 and 2.27% under RCP4.5 and 6.56 and 6.40% under RCP8.5 for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2099, respectively. All the extreme indices except consecutive wet day are expected to change significantly at the 95% confidence level during the pre-monsoon season. The study area will potentially be subjected to more frequent floods in the future both in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as a consequence of climate change. Notably, the intensity and the magnitude of flash flooding in the pre-monsoon season are expected to increase more in the future because the increase in extreme indices is more significant during that season.

This research attempts to undertake a study on the ecosystem-climate nexus in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island (PEI). Cloud-based remote sensing techniques with Google Earth Engine (GGE) are utilized to identify ecosystem changes over time. In addition, the effects of coastal flooding and storm surge ecosystems under different climate scenarios are examined. The results suggest a reduction in the forest (3%), open water or marsh component (9%), salt water (5%), no open water or marsh component (3%), and salt or brackish marsh (17%) ecosystems from 2013 to 2022. Dune and beach exhibit a non-uniform distribution across the period because of variations in natural processes, with an upward trend ranging from 0% to 11%. Approximately 257 km2 (9.4%) of PEI's ecosystems would be affected by extreme coastal flooding (scenario 4), compared to 142 km2 (5.2%), 155 km2 (5.7%), and 191 km2 (7%) in scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Under a 4 m storm surge scenario, around 223 km2 (8.2%) of PEI's ecosystems would be flooded, compared to 61 km2 (2.2%), 113 km2 (4.1%), and 168 km2 (6.1%) under 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m scenarios, respectively. The findings from this research would enable policymakers to take necessary actions to sustain ecosystem services in PEI while confronting the impacts of climate change.

J	Dutal, H				Dutal, Hurem			Using morphometric analysis for assessment of flash flood susceptibility in the Mediterranean region of Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Flash flood susceptibility; Mediterranean region; Climate change; Watershed management; Morphometric analysis	RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; PRIORITIZATION; INDIA; RUNOFF; AREA; VULNERABILITY; SENSITIVITY; PARAMETERS	Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters around the world because of their rapid and unpredictable nature. It is expected that the frequency and intensity of flood events will increase because of extreme rainfall events induced by climate change. In this context, the generation of a flood susceptibility map contributes to effective flood management in a basin. The present study aims to generate a flash flood susceptibility map for the Imali Stream Basin (ISB) situated within the Mediterranean region of Turkey. For this purpose, morphometric analysis, geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used in this study. ASTER GDEM (v.3) was used to delineate 9 sub-watersheds and to obtain the required morphometric parameters. To generate a flash flood susceptibility map, the original compound values calculated for each sub-watershed were transformed into values between 0 and 1 by using the min-max normalization method. Then, these values were divided into 3 classes called low, moderate, and high by using the equal interval classification method in ArcGIS. According to both flash flood susceptibility maps produced by using morphometric analysis and PCA, sub-watershed 5 has the highest flash flood susceptibility in the basin. The flash flood that occurred in sub-watershed 5 in 2016 contributes to these results. Therefore, flood management based on morphometric analysis can be a highly effective method for decision-makers and planners in the Mediterranean region, one of the hotspots to be affected by climate change.

Farm-level adaptation could serve as an important tool to manage these production risks. This study took the case of a vulnerable farming community of Raya Azebo district of Tigray region of Ethiopia to map household level perceptions of climate change and its induced risks, adaptation strategies, and associated factors. A multi-stage sampling approach is used to select a sample of 397 farm households from the study area and analyzed using descriptive and interferential statistics. Results show that farm households perceived significant changes in the climate, such as an increase in temperature (overall), a decline in precipitation (overall), and altering patterns of rainfall. Further, farmers' reported risks include droughts, floods, and increased pests and disease attacks on the crops. Farmers, in response to climate variability, were adopting various adaptation measures to manage climate risks at the farm-level. Crop diversification (99%), mulching (88%), soil and water management practices (78%), and use of alternative tillage practices (74%) were reported to be the most, while the use of improved seed (27%), planting trees (26%), mixed farming (12%), and home farm practice (3%) were reported to be the least adopted adaptation strategies. Results of the binary logit model showed that household head's age, literacy level, utilization of credit service, utilization of extension services, and access to farm water were the significant determinants of important adaptation strategies. This study implies improving rural households' access to various institutions-led services (i.e., climate information, advisory, and credit) to improve their adaptation and livelihood resilience.

Effects of both climate change and human water demand on a highly threatened damselfly	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CALOPTERYX-EXUL SELYS; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; LONG-RANGE MOVEMENTS; LARGE DAMS; RIVER; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; QUALITY; ECOSYSTEMS; SPLENDENS	While climate change severely affects some aquatic ecosystems, it may also interact with anthropogenic factors and exacerbate their impact. In dry climates, dams can cause hydrological drought during dry periods following a great reduction in dam water discharge. However, impact of these severe hydrological droughts on lotic fauna is poorly documented, despite climate change expected to increase drought duration and intensity. We document here how dam water discharge was affected by climate variability during 2011-2018 in a highly modified watershed in northeastern Algeria, and how an endemic endangered lotic damselfly, Calopteryx exul Selys, 1853 (Odonata: Calopterygidae), responded to hydrological drought episodes. Analysis was based on a compilation of data on climate (temperature, precipitation, and drought index), water dam management (water depth and discharge volume and frequency), survey data on C. exul occurrence, and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) of adults. The study period was characterized by a severe drought between 2014 and 2017, which led to a lowering of dam water depth and reduction of discharge into the river, with associated changes in water chemistry, particularly during 2017 and 2018. These events could have led to the extirpation of several populations of C. exul in the Seybouse River (Algeria). CMR surveys showed that the species was sensitive to water depth fluctuations, avoiding low and high water levels (drought and flooding). The study shows that climate change interacts with human water requirements and affects river flow regimes, water chemistry and aquatic fauna. As drought events are likely to increase in the future, the current study highlights the need for urgent new management plans for lotic habitats to maintain this species and possible others.

Review: The influence of global change on Europe's water cycle and groundwater recharge	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Review						Europe; Climate change; Soil processes; Weather; Groundwater recharge	STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CHANGE IMPACTS; LAND-USE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; URBAN GROUNDWATER; UNSATURATED ZONE	Roughly a third of Europe's water demand is satisfied by groundwater abstraction. Understanding how future changes in climate, weather, vegetation and land use will affect the transport of atmospheric water to the subsurface is critical for successful implementation of Europe's Water Framework Directive and to maintain groundwater as a high-quality water resource. This paper summarizes the known drivers of trends and variations in groundwater recharge (precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation, land use) in Central Europe and how they have changed in recent decades. From past observations and future climate projections, the foreseeable consequences for groundwater recharge under a changing climate are discussed. The paper focuses on the complex role of soils and vegetation at the interface between atmosphere and groundwater, and addresses open questions and possible new directions for research. Summarizing the evidence, land use and land-use change have a large control on recharge, but the influence of climate change is increasingly recognized. Central Europe's current transition from a temperate and relatively moist climate towards a more variable and Mediterranean-like climate may shift recharge patterns and increase the ratio of focused-to-diffusive recharge as precipitation patterns change and the frequency and intensity of climatic extremes (e.g., heavy rainfall, heatwaves, droughts, floods and wild fires) increase. However, uncertainty remains with regard to the dynamic response of Europe's vegetation to climate change as well as to human modifications of the water cycle (e.g., through irrigation, forest management, artificial recharge or urbanization), which currently challenges model-based predictions of future recharge.

On the feasibility of managed retreat in the Wadden Sea of Schleswig-Holstein	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Wadden Sea; Schleswig-Holstein; Sea-level rise; Managed retreat; Coastal risk management; Climate change adaptation pathways	COASTAL DEFENSE; LEVEL RISE	Sea embankments along the mainland coastline in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea safeguard 130,000 people and 19 billion euro of capital assets from flooding during storm surges. Due to climate change induced sea-level rise, these defences will become exposed to higher storm surges and adaptation becomes inevitable. As an alternative to strengthening, managed retreat is discussed in literature as a coastal risk management option for climate change adaptation. Based on an evaluation of examples from the Wadden Sea, this paper elaborates managed retreat as alternative climate change adaptation from a coastal risk management perspective. This paper concludes that, conform the principles of integrated coastal zone management, one precondition for successful implementation of managed retreat is local acceptance. With respect to natural resilience to sea-level rise, managed retreat may counteract the loss of Wadden Sea structures and habitats due to coastal squeeze. However, the effectiveness depends on the surface elevation in the opened polder. If large volumes of sediment are needed to restore a natural elevation, regional resilience against SLR-induced drowning may deteriorate. With respect to coastal flood risk management in Schleswig-Holstein, opened polders have no significance as flood retention rooms and managed retreat does not reduce the hazard of flooding in surrounding polders. Further, removal of primary embankments requires large efforts to secure flood safety in adjacent polders. Under certain conditions, removal or opening of embankments may constitute sustainable coastal risk management, e.g., if retreat leads to a shorter line of defence or if other win-win-situations like securing of NATURA 2000 coherence arise.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						climate change; natural disasters; agricultural production; food aid; official development assistance; conflict; poverty; cereal production; humanitarian aid	NATURAL DISASTERS; RISK	This study analyzed the impact of climate-related natural disasters (droughts, floods, storms/rainstorms) on economic and social variables. As the Africa-specific empirical literature is limited, this study used panel data from 1961-2011 on Africa. The study used a panel data regression model analysis. The results showed that climate change-related natural disasters affected Africa's economic growth, agriculture, and poverty and caused armed conflicts. Among the disasters, droughts are the main cause of negative impact, severely affecting crops such as maize and coffee and resulting in increased urban poverty and armed conflicts. In contrast, international aid has a positive effect but the impact is insignificant compared to the negative consequences of climate-related natural disasters. Cereal food assistance has a negative crowding-out effect on cereal production. International donors should review their interventions to support Africa's adaptative capacity to disasters. Government efficiency has reduced the number of deaths, and this is an area that supports Africa's adaptative efforts.

In recent times, numerous areas suffered from disasters that produced significant damage to cultural heritage. Although different risk management strategies are currently enforced in Central Europe, there still exist many challenges that undermine their effectiveness. This study reviews the necessary points to be addressed for strengthening existing management strategies within the region and the characteristics of potential resilience building measures. It presents feasible and tailored ICT solutions (e.g. a web GIS platform) and decision support tools (e.g. a manual for cultural heritage resilience and a handbook on transnational rescue procedures) for the protection of cultural heritage against floods, heavy rain and fire. These tools result from the Interreg Central Europe project ProteCHt2save, concentrating on risk assessment and sustainable protection of cultural heritage in changing environments. The proposed measures are tested at pilot sites and successfully integrated in local risk management plans. Future work is also proposed for further implementation of the results.

To investigate how anthropogenic climate change may influence AR characteristics in the coastal western United States by end century, we employ a suite of novel tools such as variable resolution in the Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM), the TempestExtremes AR detection algorithm, and the Ralph, Rutz, et al. (2019, ) AR category scale. We show that end-century ARs primarily shift from being "mostly or primarily beneficial" to "mostly or primarily hazardous" with a concomitant sharpening and intensification of winter season precipitation totals. Changes in precipitation totals are due to a significant increase in AR (+260%) rather than non-AR (+7%) precipitation, largely through increases in the most intense category of AR events and a decrease in the interval between landfalling ARs.

In this study, Sr/Ca ratios and delta O-18 records with the annual resolution extracted from four fossil corals that were growing during the Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch (MBACE) were used to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) and seawater delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) in the South China Sea (SCS) during the mid-to-late Holocene transition. The results indicate that the SCS experienced a rapid cooling and wetting event during the period of similar to 3,500-3,800 years BP (before present year 1950). Specifically, the average SST and delta O-18(sw) declined rapidly by similar to 3 degrees C and similar to 0.65 parts per thousand, respectively, over an interval of similar to 100 years from similar to 3,850 years BP to similar to 3,750 years BP. This rapid climate change pattern recorded in coral archives broadly agrees with those in foraminiferal and stalagmite records from adjacent land and ocean areas. Consistent with other records from the North Atlantic, this cold event in the Asia-Western Pacific region that occurred during the MBACE and was originally identified in the North Atlantic and European regions should have occurred at the global scale, which might be caused by changes in the Asian summer monsoon linked with solar irradiance and/or the North Atlantic climate. In addition, this rapid climate change might support the occurrence and timing of the outburst flood event during the Xia Dynasty and might have led to the fall of the Xia Dynasty.

To address issues arising in the Aquitaine region (south-west France, now administratively part of Nouvelle-Aquitaine), we listed possible measures for adaptation to climate change impacts at the regional level and focussing on coastal hazards. Then we assessed their effectiveness with respect to long-term climate change and to the coastal management practices they are designed for. The assessment is independent of the local context and is therefore valid in most coastal areas. For this purpose, we conducted a review of the literature to select 51 measures that are potentially applicable to the Aquitaine coast. We then classified these measures combining two approaches. The first was based on the regional management practices applied by the GIP Littoral Aquitain (a public interest group for coastal management in Nouvelle-Aquitaine) while the second drew on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) classification based on the physical-environmental, socio-economic or institutional characteristics of adaptation measures. In parallel, ten criteria were defined to assess the current and future efficiency of the measure independently of the local context. Finally, by providing an assessment of the adaptation measures using nine of these criteria, this method allowed objective and easy comparisons between measures. The results were analysed taking each criterion independently and also through a multi-criteria analysis. Overall, the measures performed well against all the binary criteria except "self-sufficiency" and "synergy with mitigation". The more detailed analysis of the results highlight the main characteristics of the measures applied in each management approach. The multi-criteria analysis identified a set of essential measures for adaptation to coastal risks in the context of climate change. 19 measures were rated at once as "no regrets", "robust" and "reversible/flexible". In general, the study shows that there are many short and medium term possibilities for adaptation (2030-2050, 2080-2100) and emphasises the need to implement some of these as soon as possible. According to our study, measures that generate immediate benefits are overwhelmingly predominant (86%).

The cascading effects of the resulting compound disasters are much harder to predict than eruptions alone. Successful response to current volcanic events draws on the collective knowledge of past patterns gained by volcanologists and other disaster management professionals, allowing them to map out strategies for preparation, monitoring, evacuation, and recovery. In the coming decades, interpretations of such familiar patterns of events will be complicated by compound hazards. To respond effectively to future events, volcanologists will need to expand their knowledge of non-volcanic hazards and more intentionally incorporate social science perspectives into disaster planning and management.

They have been crucial in raising ambitions to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees C and in advancing the difficult debate on loss and damage. Still, quantitative estimates of loss and damage for SIDS under different mitigation targets are lacking. Here we carry out an assessment of future flood risk from slow-onset sea-level rise and episodic sea-level extremes along the coastlines of SIDS worldwide. We show that by the end of this century, without adaptation, climate change would amplify present direct economic damages from coastal flooding by more than 14 times under high-emissions scenarios. Keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C could avoid almost half of unmitigated damage, depending on the region. Achieving this climate target, however, would still not prevent several SIDS from suffering economic losses that correspond to considerable shares of their GDP, probably leading to forced migration from low-lying coastal zones. Our results underline that investments in adaptation and sustainable development in SIDS are urgently needed, as well as dedicated support to assisting developing countries in responding to loss and damage due to climate change. Climate change-induced sea-level rise and coastal extremes pose serious threats to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This study provides a coastal flood risk assessment for SIDS globally and reveals the need for timely adaptation.

It is imperative to explore the potential changes in future water resources and water-related hazards at the regional scale under global warming and local socioeconomic development, while a scientific assessment of future hydrological risks requires reasonable projection of future climate, land use and vegetation changes. In order to improve the traditional statistical downscaling method, this study combines the machine learning and quantile mapping methods to project future climate under four shared socio-economic pathwayrepresentative concentration pathways (SSP-RCP) of the CMIP6. Future land use is projected jointly with the future climate by the CA-Markov model, and the vegetation dynamics are simulated by the Biome-BGC model. Then we employ a physically-based distributed hydrological model to simulate the future hydrological changes in the Upper Chao Phraya basin under the interaction among climate and land use changes and the vegetation dynamics. The results show that under the joint impact of climate and land-use changes, the study area may face increasing water scarcity and more frequent floods and droughts in the future. Water scarcity will reach the worst in the mid-21st century (water resources per capita decrease 34.2% compared to the 2010 s). By the end-21st century, the 100-year historical flood and drought in the study basin will increase by 1.63 times and 0.59 times, respectively, under the SSP126 scenario (the most sustainable pathway), and by 4.55 times and 1.56 times under the SSP370 scenario (the most pessimistic rocky-road pathway). Results demonstrate that climate change is the major cause for more frequent floods and droughts in the future, while afforestation or more sustainable land use management will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change to some extent. This finding is helpful to the local government in managing future water resources, floods, and droughts in the study basin.

Although common, but never dominating, these minority species are often overlooked compared to commercial timber trees in relation to climate change. Induced stress on trees through climate change in central Europe will not only be caused by drought but also by extreme precipitation and pluvial flooding. This study experimentally address this by testing both waterlogging and drought tolerance in three key species of Prunus for central Europe that naturally span a wide variation of habitat conditions. The selected species Prunus mahaleb, Prunus avium and Prunus padus were subjected to both drought and waterlogging in a greenhouse experiment. Plant functionality in the form of midday leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and turgor loss point together with different aspects of biomass allocation and growth was tested. All included species lost their stomatal conductance and leaf water potential within a few days in the waterlogging treatment. Only P. padus had the capacity to recover with new leaves after the waterlogging ended, suggesting that avoidance strategies though leaf shedding can be a complementary mechanism to withstand waterlogging. P. padus kept its stomatal conductance and water potential for the longest time in the drought treatment followed by P. mahaleb and P.avium. This longevity in the drought treatment for P. padus could be explained by both tolerance strategies through lower turgor loss point, but also avoidance strategies with fast changes in growth and higher allocation of biomass to the roots. There is a clear risk that ecosystem service from Prunus species in the landscape can be negatively affected not only by drought but also by increased events of waterlogging. This highlights the need for including minority species and also other climate stressors in addition to drought in the planning and management of multifunctional landscapes.

Such policies concentrate primarily on on-farm development and overlook rich prospects for off-farm diversification. Livelihood diversification of small-scale farmers plays a major role in reducing hunger and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze livelihood diversification in managing catastrophic risks among rural farm households of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. We have interviewed a total of 600 farm households through a standardized questionnaire in two districts (Nowshera and Charsadda) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan that were badly affected by the 2010 flood. For empirical analysis, a logistic regression model was chosen to analyze the important attributes that are correlated to livelihood diversification of the rural households in flood-susceptible areas of Pakistan. The survey findings indicate that 50% of the total sample respondents adopted off-farm livelihood diversification strategies, while 40.5% of farm households adopted on-farm livelihood diversification strategies in managing catastrophic risks. The logistic regression model results show that attributes including socioeconomic and demographic, institutional, and risk perception significantly influenced households' choices of livelihood diversification. Also, the findings indicated a wide range of livelihood diversification constrained including climatic risks and uncertainties (23%), inadequate natural resources (17%), limited level of skills and training (15%), lack of institutional support (12%), lack of credit facilities (11%), poor infrastructure including markets and roads (16%), and lack of labor availability (4%). The study urges the need for robust climate change adaptation policies, in particular, by aiming at training initiatives, improving access to services, and enhancing institutional assistance, and better infrastructure. The livelihood of small-scale farmers could only improve if the Government pays due consideration and adopts the right policy initiatives that promote the diversification of livelihoods as part of the creation of national jobs to save many lives and improve livelihoods.

To understand the impacts of climate and land use/cover changes on streamflow within a specific catchment, it is essential to accurately quantify their changes given many possibilities. We propose an integrated framework to assess how individual and combined climate and land use/cover changes impact the streamflow of Xinanjiang Basin, in East China, in the future. Five bias-corrected and downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections are used to indicate the inter-model uncertainties under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Additionally, three land use/cover change scenarios representing a range of tradeoffs between ecological protection (EP) and urban development (UD) are projected by Cellular Automata - Markov (CA-Markov). The streamflow in 2021-2050 is then assessed using the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with 15 scenarios and 75 possibilities. Finally, the uncertainty and attribution of streamflow changes to climate and land use/cover changes at monthly and annual scale are analyzed. Results show that while both land use/cover change alone and combined changes project an increase in streamflow, there is a disagreement on the direction of streamflow change under climate change alone. Future streamflow may undergo a more blurred boundary between the flood and non-flood seasons, potentially easing the operation stress of Xinanjiang Reservoir for water supply or hydropower generation. We find that the impacts of climate and land use/cover changes on monthly mean streamflow are sensitive to the impermeable area (IA).The impacts of climate change are stronger than those induced by land use/cover change under EP (i.e., lower IA); and land use/cover change has a greater impact in case of UD (i.e., higher IA). However, changes in annual mean streamfiow are mainly driven by land use/cover change, and climate change may decrease the influence attributed to land use/cover change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Flood damages are likely to grow due to climate change induced sea-level rise and increasing exposure if no further adaptation measures are taken. This paper quantifies potential damage and adaptation costs of coastal flooding in China over the 21st Century, including the effects of sea-level rise. It develops and utilises a new, detailed coastal database of China developed within the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model framework. The refined database provides a more realistic spatial representation of coasts, with more than 2700 coastal segments, covering 28,966 km of coastline. Over 50% of China's coast is artificial, representing defended coast and/or claimed land. Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs for China are assessed for different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) combinations representing climate change and socio-economic change and two adaptation strategies: no upgrade of currently existing defences and maintaining current protection levels. By 2100, 0.7-20.0 million people may be flooded/yr and US$ 67-3,308 billion damages/yr are projected without upgrade to defences. In contrast, maintaining the current protection level would reduce those numbers to 0.2-0.4 million people flooded/yr and US$ 22-60 billion/yr flood costs by 2100, with protection investment costs of US$ 8-17 billion/yr. In 2100, maintaining current protection levels, dikes costs are two orders of magnitude smaller than flood costs across all scenarios, even without accounting for indirect damages. This research improves on earlier national assessments of China by generating a wider range of projections, based on improved datasets.

The upward trend in population size along with an improved quality of life are expected to continue, and with them the demand for water. Available water for human consumption and development remains virtually the same. Additional to the different pressures of the demand side on the available resources (offer side), climate variability and change apply further pressures to the management of the resource. Additional to the increase in evaporation due to temperature rise, climate change is responsible for more frequent and intense water related extreme events, such as floods and droughts. Anthropogenic activities often result in the contamination of the few pristine water resources and exacerbate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, they are responsible for altering the state of the environment and minimizing the ecosystem services provided. Thus, the water security of countries is compromised posing harder challenges to poor countries to address it. This compromise is taking place in a complex context of scarce and shared resources. Across the world, 153 countries share rivers, lakes and aquifers, home to 40% of the world's current population. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is the scientific arm of the United Nations and its International Hydrological Programme (IHP) is the main vehicle for work in water sciences at an intergovernmental level. IHP VIII, IHP's medium term strategy, aims to assist UNESCO's Member States (MS) in achieving water security by mobilizing international cooperation to improve knowledge and innovation, strengthening the science-policy interface, and facilitating education and capacity development in order to enhance water resource management and governance. Furthermore, the organization has established an Urban Water Management Programme (UWMP) aiming at promoting sustainable water resource management in urban areas.

'As a farmer you've just got to learn to cope': Understanding dairy farmers' perceptions of climate change and adaptation decisions in the lower south Island of Aotearoa-New Zealand	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Adaptation; Climate change; Dairy farming; Equity; Fairness; Vulnerability; Aotearoa-New Zealand	CHANGE BELIEFS; VULNERABILITY; AGRICULTURE; VALUES; FAIRNESS; IMPACTS; PERSPECTIVES; MITIGATION; EMISSIONS; KNOWLEDGE	The impacts and implications of climate change - such as floods, droughts, heavy rainfall and increased regulation - are affecting dairy farming practices in the lower South Island (Te Waipaounamu) of Aotearoa-New Zealand. Adapting to these changes, in an equitable and transformational manner, is dependent on understanding the underlying root causes of vulnerability alongside local knowledge and values. We apply an intersectional values-based and contextual analysis to describe how past and present processes of agrarian change interact across different farmer identities to influence adaptive pathways. Local knowledge, place-based experience, values and perceptions of fairness intersect with different facets of a farmer's identity - such as financial capacity, land ownership status, debt arrangements, age and gendered participation - to enable or constrain adaptive action. Notably, notions of fairness, whether real or perceived, vary across farmer groups, and influence the kinds of adaptation activities that dairy farmers are willing, or potentially able, to engage in. The results call for more contextualised engagement with farming communities, and highlight the need to build a shared understanding of the complex historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental drivers of past, present and future change, in this highly productive, yet risky, agricultural landscape.

Pregnant women in flood contexts could face challenges in utilisation of maternal healthcare. The aim of this paper is to analyse associations between flood exposure and the use of maternal healthcare (antenatal care visits, birth assisted by skilled birth attendants, and giving birth in a health facility) in Bangladesh for pregnancies/births between 2004 and 2018. Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data from four surveys in the time period 2007-2018 and data on floods from the Emergency Events Database and the Geocoded Disasters Dataset are analysed using multilevel linear probability models. In line with previous results, we find clear bivariate associations between exposure to flooding and maternal healthcare use. These associations are largely confounded by socioeconomic and demographic variables. In general, exposure to flooding - whether measured as exposure to any floods or severe floods - does not affect maternal healthcare use, and we suggest that the lower usage of maternal healthcare in areas exposed to flooding rather relates to the characteristics of the flood-prone areas and their populations, which also relate to lower maternal healthcare use. However, we find negative associations in some supplementary analyses, which suggest that even if there is no effect of floods on average, specific floods may have negative effects on maternal healthcare use.

J	Nikkanen, M; Räsänen, A; Juhola, S				Nikkanen, Maija; Rasanen, Aleksi; Juhola, Sirkku			The influence of socioeconomic factors on storm preparedness and experienced impacts in Finland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Storm preparedness; Natural hazards; Climate change adaptation; Social vulnerability; Nordic countries; Disaster risk management	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NATURAL DISASTERS; HOUSEHOLD PREPAREDNESS; MITIGATION MEASURES; RISK; FLOOD; HAZARDS; CONTEXT; RESILIENCE	Extreme weather events, such as storms, may cause material damage, injuries, and interfere with day-to-day operation of societies. Earlier research on natural hazards and climate change adaptation has found that demographic and socioeconomic factors influence the way individuals prepare for and are affected by natural hazards. However, research often focuses on areas with high exposure and vulnerability and research on low exposure and vulnerability areas is scarcer. To address this gap, we ask: do socioeconomic and demographic factors matter in how individuals prepare for and are affected by storms in Finland? Our data consist of an internet survey (n = 1014) conducted after a severe winter storm hit Finland in the beginning of 2019, and we analyze the data with Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions. Our results show that respondents? education level or employment status are not connected to whether they took preparedness measures or whether they experienced harm. Instead, the type of residential property does play a part. In addition, respondents who had experienced storm-related harm during recent years are more likely to prepare than those who have not. In conclusion, socio-demographic factors seem to have only marginal influence on storm preparedness or experienced impacts in Finland, which contradicts earlier research. This may stem from the relatively equal distribution of well-being among the population.

Gaertn. Due to Climate Change	WETLANDS			English	Article						Barringtonia acutangula; Indo-Bangladesh Landscape; Climate change; Distribution; MaxEnt; Modelling	HABITAT DISTRIBUTION; IMPACT; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; FLOODPLAIN; PATTERNS; MAXENT; FUTURE	Barringtonia acutangula is a tree species adapted to floodplains. The species has traditionally been managed over millennia as family and community forest in the Ganges- Brahmaputra- Meghna basin. Although much of the floodplain forest has been removed and converted to agriculture, some forest does remain along most banks. Here, we examined current and future habitat suitability under climate change scenarios that could help to manage Barringtonia acutangula, a rheophytic tree of socio-ecological importance. We model the habitat suitability class of B. acutangula under current and future climate (2050) scenarios based on 89 (57 from India and 32 from Bangladesh) locations and bio-climatic and elevation variables using species distribution modelling (SDM) by MaxEnt. Out of the total area, i.e., 2,450,577 km(2), of the Indo-Bangladesh landscape, 199,063 km(2) (8.12%) is highly suitable for the distribution of B. acutangula, but it is predicted to decrease by 50.57% (100,669 km(2)) by 2050 under the future climate change scenario. Country-wise habitat analysis revealed that out of the total area (139,799 km(2)) in Bangladesh, 95,541 km(2) (68.34%) is highly suitable area for B. acutangula, but this is projected to decline under the climate change scenario by 34,801 km(2) (36.43%) by 2050. While in India, the highly suitable area of B. acutangula is 103,522 km(2) (4.48%) and is predicted to further decrease by 65,868 km(2) (63.63%) by 2050. Our study highlights that precipitation seasonality, precipitation in the coldest quarter and precipitation in the driest period are the strongest predictors of the distribution of B. acutangula in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. In the climate change scenario, changes in the precipitation pattern, in particular, can put B. acutangula under stress and lead to a high risk of population shrinkage in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. Therefore, urgent attention is needed for conservation of B. acutangula, as it is sensitive and vulnerable to changing global climatic patterns.

The sustainability of urban green as part of NbS packages and the usefulness for improvement of livelihoods is determined by the spatial (geographical location) and temporal (time of action) scales, and socio-ecological and institutional factors. Various NbS packages have shown the ability for use as climate change adaptation measures throughout the world. These functions include protection from soil erosion, protection from inland flooding, buffering natural resources against drier and more variable climates, protection from coastal hazards and sea-level rise, moderation of urban heatwaves and effects of heat island, and managing storm-water and flooding in urban areas. Furthermore, the benefits of urban agriculture and arboriculture include use as sources of food and generation of income; improve recreation and social interactions, and the sustainability of biodiversity. They also mitigate the impact of environmental pollution and climate change through reduction of gas emissions and act as carbon sinks. While the starting capital and lack of policy on urban agriculture and arboriculture in many countries, the importance of the industry is inevitably a useful agenda especially in the Global South due to vulnerability to the impact of climate change. This review also suggests the inclusion of all institutions, governments, and relevant stakeholders to emphasize gender sensitization at all levels of planning and decision-making in food production and adaptation measures to climate change.

However, climate change affects the mean, extreme, and data structure of precipitation. Quantile regression, which can reflect every part of the trends of data, was used to detect responses of each part of precipitation in China. The V2.0 dataset of daily precipitation grid data (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees) from 1961 to 2020 in China was used as practical observation data. Daily precipitation in 2015-2100 from the China Model BCC-CSM2-MR of scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 were chosen as future climate changes with moderate and high radiative forcing, respectively. On the basis of the sign consistency of the slope coefficients with quantile regression, the results of quantiles q = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 were selected to represent low, median, high and flood precipitation, respectively. Precipitation in four seasons was separately analyzed to observe seasonal characteristics in China. For the observation data, precipitation had obviously different responses in the low and high percentiles and was present in mainly spring and summer. In spring, in the middle and lower Yangtze Plains, the low and median precipitation increased, whereas the high and flood precipitation significantly decreased. In summer, Heilongjiang Province and northern Inner Mongolia showed decreasing trends in the low quantile and increasing trends in the high quantile, indicating a completely opposite trend adjustment. These regions deserve more attention. However, obviously different responses in low and high percentiles were not so evident in future climate changes. Self-consistency in model data may weaken the heteroscedastic characteristics of precipitation.

Overall, China's action to adapt to climate change remains in its infancy, and relevant research needs to be further deepened. In this paper, we study the future adaptive countermeasures of Shenzhen city in the Pearl River Delta in terms of climate change, especially urban flood risk resilience. Based on the background investigation of urban flood risk in Shenzhen, this paper calculates the annual precipitation frequency of Shenzhen from 1953 to 2020, and uses the extreme precipitation index as a quantitative indicator to analyze the changes in historical precipitation and the impact of major flood disasters in Shenzhen city in previous decades. Based on the six kinds of model data of the scenario Model Inter-comparison Project (MIP) in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6), uses the Taylor diagram and MR comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the ability of different climate models to simulate extreme precipitation in Shenzhen, and the selected models are aggregated and averaged to predict the climate change trend of Shenzhen from 2020 to 2100. The prediction results show that Shenzhen will face more severe threats from rainstorms and floods in the future. Therefore, this paper proposes a resilience strategy for the city to cope with the threat of flood in the future, including constructing a smart water management system and promoting the development of a sponge city. Moreover, to a certain extent, it is necessary to realize risk transfer by promoting a flood insurance system.

Although increasing temperature has taken centre stage in the debate over climate change, animals will have to survive more than just extreme heat to persist in the Anthropocene. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in the opportunities for integrative and applied behavioural study of how animals can survive life-threatening weather events, in order to help achieve the societal goal of maintaining viable wildlife populations under future climate scenarios. First, using the thermoregulatory behaviour of a hypothetical ground squirrel species as an example, we explore how different scenarios of behavioural flexibility, plasticity, adaptation, exaptation and management action can lead to population persistence or extinction. Next, we propose that considering weather events such as heatwaves, storms and floods, wildfire and drought as selective pressures worthy of investigation provides a new research framework for climate-related conservation behaviour. In our review we provide examples of the responses of animals to different types of weather extremes and describe behavioural adaptations to environments with extreme climates. We give methodological recommendations to jump start climate change research by behaviourists. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for using citizen science and a public video repository to foster evidence-based decision making for managing habitats and prioritizing species conservation efforts in light of the threats to biodiversity posed by climate change.

Tools are needed to support adaptive management approaches that allow society to adapt incrementally by making decisions now without creating path dependency and compromising decision-making options in the future. We developed an agent-based model that integrates climate-related physical hazard drivers and socio-economic drivers. We used it to explore how adaptive actions might be sequentially triggered within a low-elevation coastal city in New Zealand, in response to various climate change and socio-economic scenarios. We found that different adaptive actions are triggered at about the same RSLR level regardless of shared socio-economic pathway/representative concentration pathway scenario. The timing of actions within each pathway is dictated mainly by the rate of RSLR and the timing and severity of storm events. For the representative study site, the model suggests that the limits for soft and hard protection will occur around 30 cm RSLR, fully-pumped water systems are viable to around 35 cm RSLR and infrastructure upgrades and policy mechanisms are feasible until between 40 cm and 75 cm RSLR. After 75 cm RSLR, active retreat is the only remaining adaptation pathway.

It becomes important to develop qualitative scenario storylines to assess future flooding risk in a changing environment over the highly urbanized areas. In this study, the future (2030-2050) flood risk in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China was assessed based on the MaxEnt model. We have developed four future scenarios under different emission conditions based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). The MaxEnt model was trained by using flood hazard sample point data and flood risk indicators, meanwhile, food risk prediction with high accuracy was obtained. We analyzed the influencing factors of flood risk and predicted the flood risk of the PRD under four future scenarios. According to the results, there is a significant increase in the size and proportion of high flood risk areas in most scenarios. Flood risk under scenario SSP5-RCP8.5 are expected to be the most serious in the future. Population density (POPD) and Gross domestic product density (GDPD) have the highest explanatory power for flood risk. This study predict the changes of flood risk under the combined influence of climate change and human activities, and hoped to provide a reference for future planning and disaster mitigation construction in PRD cities.

In particular, the lack of preparedness for flooding events in inland regions will compound the losses. However, the causes, impacts, and responses to these disasters in inland areas remain poorly understood. Here, using the recent 7 center dot 20 flood disaster in 2021 in the inland province of Henan, China, as an example, we examine the extreme flood, the impacts, and how the climate extremeness and inappropriate human responses caused the great damage. Results showed that the average cumulative precipitation in Zhengzhou was above 250 mm when the flood happened. 10.29 % of the total area and 7.55 % of the total population in Zhengzhou were flooded. Cropland, urban built-up, industrial, and residential areas were hit hardest in terms of land cover type and urban function zone. The Zhengzhou flood was a compound effect of multiple natural hazards reaching the region simultaneously and, on top of this, the region's extreme lack of preparation. Our paper not only took the human response into the current flood risk and flood control system but also put forward transformative measures to improve cities' adaptability to climate change in China and beyond. This paper will be a wake-up call for addressing the human factors exacerbating climate change-related disasters and will provide a reference for transformative disaster governance in inland areas worldwide.

The purpose of this report is to provide information since the last climate change review with a focus on asthmatic disease. PubMed and Internet searches for topics included climate and weather change, air pollution, particulates, greenhouse gasses, traffic, insect habitat, and mitigation in addition to references contributed by the individual authors. Changes in patterns of outdoor aeroallergens caused by increasing temperatures and amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are major factors linked to increased duration of pollen seasons, increased pollen production, and possibly increased allergenicity of pollen. Indoor air pollution threats anticipated from climate changes include microbial and mold growth secondary to flooding, resulting in displacement of persons and need for respiratory protection of exposed workers. Air pollution from indoor burning of mosquito repellants is a potential anticipatory result of an increase in habitat regions. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning and traffic-related emissions can alter respiratory defense mechanisms and work synergistically with specific allergens to enhance immunogenicity to worsen asthma in susceptible subjects.

J	Peterson, L				Peterson, Lauri			Silver Lining to Extreme Weather Events? Democracy and Climate Change Mitigation	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS			English	Article							POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONS; POLICY; DRIVERS; VULNERABILITY; COMMITMENT; GOVERNANCE; RISK; INDICATORS; EXPERIENCE; COUNTRIES	Long-standing meteorological research has established that anthropogenic climate change increases the risk and intensity of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, and forest fires. However, comparatively little is known about the impact of such events on policy ambition. Studies on the topic emerged only recently and tend to focus on individual country cases. A comprehensive cross-country perspective is still missing. This article addresses the gap in the literature using large-scale analyses on the basis of country-level data from 2008 to 2017. The findings indicate that extreme weather events propel only highly functioning democracies to tackle climate change. Effects among remaining country cases are insignificant. This variation in the data can be attributed to democracies' concern for the common good and the perspectives of those most affected by climate-related disasters.

Groundwater and Drought Resilience in the SGMA Era	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES			English	Article						Drought reserves; drought resilience; groundwater; Sustainable Groundwater Management Act	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BANKING	Projections are that climate change will increase drought risk and intensity globally. Groundwater is critical during drought, but worldwide aquifers are experiencing unrecoverable groundwater declines. California is ideal to explore strategies for managing groundwater for drought resilience. Many areas rely on groundwater, yet multiple basins are in overdraft. Management was historically centered in local water districts, but in 2014, the state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) establishing mandatory groundwater management rules. This paper discusses strategies used prior to and post SGMA to sustainably manage groundwater for drought resilience, and evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies. It highlights two recent approaches that can increase drought resilience under climate change: flood-MAR - using flood flows for both recharge and irrigation; and the development of locally sited groundwater drought reserves that can serve as a buffer during extreme droughts.

J	Dutta, TK; Phani, V				Dutta, Tushar K.; Phani, Victor			The pervasive impact of global climate change on plant-nematode interaction continuum	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						plant-parasitic nematodes; geographic distribution; global climate change; population dynamics; elevated CO2 level; altered precipitation; sustainable management; agroecosystem	HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS; ELEVATED CO2; SOIL NEMATODES; NITROUS-OXIDE; COMMUNITY RESPONSES; PRATYLENCHUS SPP.; POTENTIAL IMPACT; N FERTILIZATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; GRAZED PASTURE	Pest profiles in today's global food production system are continually affected by climate change and extreme weather. Under varying climatic conditions, plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) cause substantial economic damage to a wide variety of agricultural and horticultural commodities. In parallel, their herbivory also accredit to diverse ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, allocation and turnover of plant biomass, shaping of vegetation community, and alteration of rhizospheric microorganism consortium by modifying the root exudation pattern. Thus PPNs, together with the vast majority of free-living nematodes, act as ecological drivers. Because of direct exposure to the open environment, PPN biology and physiology are largely governed by environmental factors including temperature, precipitation, humidity, atmospheric and soil carbon dioxide level, and weather extremes. The negative effects of climate change such as global warming, elevated CO2, altered precipitation and the weather extremes including heat waves, droughts, floods, wildfires and storms greatly influence the biogeographic range, distribution, abundance, survival, fitness, reproduction, and parasitic potential of the PPNs. Changes in these biological and ecological parameters associated to the PPNs exert huge impact on agriculture. Yet, depending on how adaptable the species are according to their geo-spatial distribution, the consequences of climate change include both positive and negative effects on the PPN communities. While assorting the effects of climate change as a whole, it can be estimated that the changing environmental factors, on one hand, will aggravate the PPN damage by aiding to abundance, distribution, reproduction, generation, plant growth and reduced plant defense, but the phenomena like sex reversal, entering cryptobiosis, and reduced survival should act in counter direction. This seemingly creates a contraposition effect, where assessing any confluent trend is difficult. However, as the climate change effects will differ according to space and time it is apprehensible that the PPNs will react and adapt according to their location and species specificity. Nevertheless, the bio-ecological shifts in the PPNs will necessitate tweaking their management practices from the agri-horticultural perspective. In this regard, we must aim for a 'climate-smart' package that will take care of the food production, pest prevention and environment protection. Integrated nematode management involving precise monitoring and modeling-based studies of population dynamics in relation to climatic fluctuations with escalated reliance on biocontrol, host resistance, and other safer approaches like crop rotation, crop scheduling, cover cropping, biofumigation, use of farmyard manure (FYM) would surely prove to be viable options. Although the novel nematicidal molecules are target-specific and relatively less harmful to the environment, their application should not be promoted following the global aim to reduce pesticide usage in future agriculture. Thus, having a reliable risk assessment with scenario planning, the adaptive management strategies must be designed to cope with the impending situation and satisfy the farmers' need.

Study of future climate change and drought conditions in the upper Siem Reap River catchment is vital because this river plays a crucial role in maintaining the Angkor Temple Complex and livelihood of the local population since 12th century. The resolution of climate data from Global Circulation Models (GCM) is too coarse to employ effectively at the watershed scale, and therefore downscaling of the dataset is required. Artificial neural network (ANN) and Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) models were applied in this study to downscale precipitation and temperatures from three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios) from Global Climate Model data of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) on a daily and monthly basis. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were adopted to develop criteria for dry and wet conditions in the catchment. Trend detection of climate parameters and drought indices were assessed using the Mann-Kendall test. It was observed that the ANN and SDSM models performed well in downscaling monthly precipitation and temperature, as well as daily temperature, but not daily precipitation. Every scenario indicated that there would be significant warming and decreasing precipitation which contribute to mild drought. The results of this study provide valuable information for decision makers since climate change may potentially impact future water supply of the Angkor Temple Complex (a World Heritage Site).

Extreme events (such as marine storms, medicanes, etc.) are likely to increase the coastal risks in the region (e.g., erosion, flooding, and inundation), resulting in a significant socio-economic impact, loss of natural biodiversity and ecosystem services, and damage to cultural heritage along the affected coasts. Therefore, climate-related risk assessment procedures are crucial for the management and sustainable development of coastal areas. The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the literature on the assessment of both the long- and short- term effects of climate change on coastal Mediterranean areas. It emphasizes methods and techniques to evaluate coastal vulnerability and sea level rise risk. This paper presents an overview of relevant scientific literature on the matter with a focus on approaches used in addressing the issues on climate change, as well as the geographic distribution of papers on the topic, highlighting the main aspects addressed in different Mediterranean countries.

Due to the difficulties in measuring this damage, the literature on the impact of climate change on it is relatively scarce. The aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of climate change on losses caused by windstorms in Poland over the twenty-first century. To do that, damage over threshold methodology is applied, in which losses depend on how much a given threshold is exceeded. In line with existing literature, the 98th percentile threshold and cubic damage function are applied to the data on the wind speed of gust from EURO-CORDEX simulations. As a result, it turns out that the losses caused by windstorms in Poland will increase in relative terms until 2100 by 29% in the RCP4.5 scenario and 32% in the RCP8.5 scenario. By 2050, these changes will be less significant, but still increases by 6% in RCP4.5 and 16% in RCP8.5 can be expected.

The combined effect of warming and drying is expected to augment the regional impacts of global warming. In addition to changes in mean climatic conditions, global warming is likely to induce changes in several aspects of extreme rainfall such as duration and magnitude. In this context, we explore the impact of climate change on precipitation with the use of several indicators. We focus on Cyprus, a water-stressed island located in the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Our results are derived from a new high-resolution simulation for the 21st century, which is driven by a "business-as-usual" scenario. In addition to a strong temperature increase (up to 4.1 degrees C), our analysis highlights that, on average for the island, most extreme precipitation indicators decrease, suggesting a transition to much drier conditions. The absolute daily rainfall maxima exhibit strong local variability, indicating the need for high resolution simulations to understand the potential impacts on future flooding.

Various approaches, including nutrient load reduction, artificial mixing and flushing, omnivorous fish removal, algaecide applications and sediment dredging, have been used to reduce bloom occurrences. However, managers now face the additional challenge of having to address the effects of climate change on watershed hydrological and nutrient load dynamics, water temperature, mixing regime and internal nutrient cycling. Rising temperatures and increasing frequencies and magnitudes of extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods and droughts, all promote CyanoHABs and affect the efficacy of ecosystem remediation measures. These climatic changes will likely require setting stricter nutrient (including both nitrogen and phosphorus) reduction targets for bloom control in affected waters. In addition, the efficacy of currently used methods to reduce CyanoHABs will need to be re-evaluated in light of the synergistic effects of climate change with nutrient enrichment.

Assessing climate change and adaptive capacity at local scale using observed and remotely sensed data	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						Adaptation; Drought; Agriculture; Smallholder farming; Resilience; Risk reduction	TEMPERATURE-HUMIDITY INDEX; HEAT-STRESS; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TIME-SERIES; VEGETATION; DROUGHT; ADAPTATION; SEASONALITY	Climate variability and change impacts are manifesting through declining rainfall totals and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, floods and heatwaves. These environmental changes are affecting mostly rural populations in developing countries due to low adaptive capacity and high reliance on natural systems for their livelihoods. While broad adaptation strategies exist, there is need to contextualise them to local scale. This paper assessed rainfall, temperature and water stress trends over time in Capricorn District, South Africa, using Standardized Precipitation Index, Thermal Heat Index, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy of water stress. Observed rainfall and temperature data from 1960 to 2015 was used to assess climatic variations, and NDVI was used to assess water stress from 2000 to 2019. Results show a marked increase in drought frequency and intensity, decreasing rainfall totals accompanied by increasing temperatures, and increasing water stress during the summer season. Long-term climatic changes are a basis to develop tailor-made adaptation strategies. Eighty-one percent of the cropped area in Capricorn District is rainfed and under smallholder farming, exposing the district to climate change risks. As the intensity of climate change varies both in space and time, adaptation strategies also vary depending on exposure and intensity. A combination of observed and remotely sensed climatic data is vital in developing tailor-made adaptation strategies.

J	Duan, HF; Gao, XC				Duan, Huan-Feng; Gao, Xichao			Flooding Control and Hydro-Energy Assessment for Urban Stormwater Drainage Systems under Climate Change: Framework Development and Case Study	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Detention tank; Flooding control; Hydro-energy; Urban stormwater drainage system (USDS)	CHANGE PROJECTIONS; POWER-GENERATION; IMPACTS; PLANTS; MODEL	Flooding issue and energy shortage have become the common concerns impeding the urban development under climate change scenarios. Exploiting potential hydro-energy from urban stormwater drainage system (USDS) has multiple beneficial perspectives for controlling flooding, relieving energy shortage and mitigating the greenhouse gases emission, which has not yet been systematically investigated in previous works. In this paper, a systematical analysis framework is developed to design the flooding risk control measures and to assess the feasibility and capacity of the hydro-energy development in USDS. The GCMs and HBV models, integrated within the SWMM computation platform, are adopted to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic processes during rainfall events, with the results used to manage the flooding situation and evaluate the energy generation capacity under the influences of both historical and future climate changes. The framework is then applied to a practical case in Tung Chung town of Hong Kong. The analysis result shows that, in the studied area, it is significant and worthwhile to develop the hydro-energy in USDS, which is evidenced to be beneficial to the energy generation and the flooding risk control as well as water resources management in the urban drainage system. The developed method and obtained results of this study may provide a new perspective and technical guide for effective USDS management and operation.

This study used the daily precipitation data from 33 meteorological stations across 61 years (1960-2020), utilized the MK test and the Z index to calculate the levels of drought and waterlogging (DW) at multiple times (month and year) and spatial (province, sub-divisions, station) scales, and investigated the spatiotemporal patterns and their associated factors in DW in the karst mountains of Guizhou, southwest China. The results showed that: (1) DW occurred frequently and increasingly during the study period in Guizhou, with seven mutations of annual DW. (2) There were more droughts (especially heavy droughts) based on annual data, but more waterlogging (especially heavy waterlogging) based on monthly data. Drought occurred most frequently in summer, while waterlogging was most frequent in spring, followed by winter. (3) The normalized difference drought and waterlogging index (NDDWI) was created in this study to exhibit combined DW phenomena, which could be improved in the future to better present the compound hazards. The spatiotemporal patterns of DW in Guizhou were complicated and associated with terrain, geology, climate change, vegetation, land use, etc.	[Dai, Li; Zhao, Yuhan; Zhou, Fang; Yu, Xianyun] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China; [Yin, Changying; Zhang, Ping] Guizhou Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Guiyang 550003, Peoples R China; [Mao, Chunyan] Guiyang Geog Informat Big Data Ctr, Guiyang 550002, Peoples R China	Guizhou Normal University; Guizhou Institute of Technology	Yin, CY (corresponding author), Guizhou Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Guiyang 550003, Peoples R China.	changying.yin@foxmail.com	Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023; Liu, Yiwei/JUF-2477-2023; Zhang, Yuan/JUF-7293-2023; JIANG, Peng/KGL-3427-2024; yang, zhou/KBB-6972-2024; Yu, Xianyun/ISS-9963-2023; DAI, Jinjia/KCL-5110-2024; chen, jiayi/KHV-5520-2024						62	1	1	17	27	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2071-1050		SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL	Sustainability	MAR	2023	15	6							5545	10.3390/su15065545	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15065545			17	Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	A9ZX6		gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000958636600001

The potential for water capture to abate pollution and recharge aquifers is also considered. This research is motivated by the increased likelihood of flooding and demands for improved transportation resilience. Based on the impacts from a 2004 flood in Honolulu, installation of permeable asphalt pavements on residential streets with low-to-moderate traffic volumes, and 2% to 5% slope, flooding would be significantly reduced. With the highest absorption rate (90%), 1.8 trillion gal/year could be diverted, while, with a lower absorption rate (50%), 691 billion gallons would be captured. The transformation of roadways, culverts, stormwater infrastructure, and existing drainage systems requires a different approach to planning, designing, construction, and paving (or not) roadways. Adoption of nature-based transportation solutions and integration with low impact development standards by local governments are needed to reduce flood risk and improve environmental quality. Design criteria are reviewed in the context of a specific watershed but also for development and application of methods in other locations. Improved communications and collaboration between researchers, land use planners, and practitioners will further advance resilience through innovation and adaptation to climate change. Porosity is also a factor and requires appreciation for nature and understanding of the seepage and conveyance of new ideas.

The Effect of Natural and Anthropogenic Climate Changes on River Runoff and Snow Water Equivalent in the Lena River Basin	WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						runoff formation; natural climate changes; anthropogenic climate changes; hydrological models; snow water equivalent; Lena River	CHANGE IMPACT; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; REGIME	The hydrological models ECOMAG and HBV were used to calculate the characteristics of river flow and snow Water Equivalent in the Lena River basin. The input data included the meteorological observations and the results of calculations with global climate models with the implementation of scenarios of natural climate conditions, taking into account the anthropogenic effect on climate. The calculations were made for a historical period (1970-1999) and up to the end of the XXI century. Hydrological models for several hydrometric gages in the Lena basin were calibrated and verified. The simulation of the annual and seasonal runoff using the climate model data was evaluated by comparison with observation data. According to the results using numerical experiments over the historical period, the increase in the Lena runoff is mostly due to natural climate variations. Conversely, in the XXI century, the anthropogenic climate changes determine the specific features of the regime of river runoff and snow cover. The warming caused by an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere leads to an increase in snow water equivalent and transformation of the hydrological regime in the area, in particular, to an earlier beginning of active snow melting (up to two weeks) and higher maximal discharges during spring flood. At the same time, the volume of runoff decreases in the summer and increases in the autumn and winter.	[Kalugin, A. S.; Lupakov, S.

These people lack facilities and means of self-protection against risks, especially natural disasters related to climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to study the livelihood vulnerability under climate change in rural regions of Vietnam. The study was based on the original Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and LVI-IPCC (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) combined with the use of dataset from the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) in 2018. by using the dataset from the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) in 2018. The database is composed of 1,852 rural households in 12 provinces in Vietnam and considers socio-demographic profile, livelihood, health, food, social networks, water status, natural disasters, and climate variability. The results show that the North Central and South Central Coasts are the most vulnerable regions, with a lower LVI score (0.261) but higher LVI-IPCC score (0.012); this is mainly due to higher exposure to disasters-such as floods, sea storms, and tropical depressions-which heavily affect people's livelihood. The Red River Delta, the Northern Midlands and Mountains, and the Central Highlands are moderately vulnerable. Moreover, the research outcome indicates that the Red River Delta and the Mekong River Delta were more vulnerable in terms of the sensitivity factor due to a higher vulnerability score on food and water components, especially drought and saltwater intrusions	[Thi Anh Nguyet Vo; Tien Khai Tran] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam	Ho Chi Minh City University Economics	Vo, TAN (corresponding author), Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Sch Econ, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.	vtanguyet@ctu.edu.vn			University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam	University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam	This research was funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.		92	4	4	3	24	TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA	1080-7039	1549-7860		HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS	Hum.

This research incorporated two field experiments with the aim to assess immediate and longer-term functional responses of floodplain plants to hydrological change. Plant introductions and transplants between a wetter riparian and a drier site in southern England were used to simulate hydrological change. Species showed immediate and differential responses to contrasting hydrologies. Rhinanthus minor, a hemi-parasitic annual species with ruderal traits, was lost from the riparian grassland within four weeks. The survival and production of a leguminous perennial, Lathyrus pratensis, in high groundwater levels soon decreased. However, the perennial Primula veris mostly functioned well in contrasting hydrological regimes, possibly because it can tolerate stress. The perennial wetland species Caltha palustris showed lag effects, over three years, when its hydrology was altered to a sub-optimal drier scenario by transplantation, with declining survival and a sustained reduction in leaf production and flowering. Disturbance caused by transplantation and weather conditions also affected its performance. Thus, this study shows that some functionally important floodplain species may succumb within weeks to a hydrological event facilitated by climate change, unless they are able to tolerate the challenging conditions, while the performance of other characteristic species could decline and continue to show constrained performance for years as a consequence of altered hydrology.

Study focus: The vegetation conditions play a significant role in regulating river runoff under climate change. However, the effect of vegetation growth induced by climate change to runoff variation remains controversial as relevant studies are mainly focused on the influences of climate change to runoff variation and vegetation growth, respectively. In this study, the response of runoff generation to change of Leaf Area Index (LAI) inputs during 1981-2010 in YRB were explored by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. New hydrological insights: The VIC model with dynamic LAI inputs performs better in the YRB, especially in the sub-basins with apparent peak clipping effect by LAI overestimation. The impact mechanism of how runoff variation is driven by LAI change in the meadow, tundra and cultivated vegetation cover is evapotranspiration-controlled by energy redistribution. However, the LAI changes in coniferous and broad-leaved forest cover affect the runoff generation mainly by redistributing energy-water to alter both evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture, so do the shrub and grassland during the growing season (Apr.similar to Sep.). The results highlight implanting grassland would be efficient to reduce the flash flood runoff in a short term and balance groundwater runoff in a long run. The broad-leaved forest and coniferous forest with a longer growth cycle also play a main role in adjusting soil moisture.

Prediction of water quality parameters becomes more challenging with these extremes since water quality is strongly related to hydro-meteorological conditions and is particularly sensitive to climate change. The evidence linking the influence of hydro-meteorological factors on water quality provides insights into future climatic extremes. Despite recent breakthroughs in water quality modeling and evaluations of climate change's impact on water quality, climate extreme informed water quality modeling methodologies remain restricted. This review aims to summarize the causal mechanisms across climate extremes considering water quality parameters and Asian water quality modeling methods associated with climate extremes, such as floods and droughts. In this review, we (1) identify current scientific approaches to water quality modeling and prediction in the context of flood and drought assessment, (2) discuss the challenges and impediments, and (3) propose potential solutions to these challenges to improve understanding of the impact of climate extremes on water quality and mitigate their negative impacts. This study emphasizes that one crucial step toward enhancing our aquatic ecosystems is by comprehending the connections between climate extreme events and water quality through collective efforts. The connections between the climate indices and water quality indicators were demonstrated to better understand the link between climate extremes and water quality for a selected watershed basin.

The impacts of climate change on wastewater systems are numerous and can lead to wide ranging implications over changing timescales. This paper considers the significance of the impacts and implications, how they will be distributed across different groups, how they will manifest in different contexts and locations, and conclude by proposing a range of guiding principles for local government decision makers. The research firstly considered direct climate-related impacts on a range of wastewater system elements (including reticulated wastewater systems, on-site wastewater systems and treatment plants), in both urban and peri-urban settings in New Zealand. The impacts identified for each aspect of the wastewater network were found to fit within three broad impact themes; nuisance flooding spills and odour, water quality deterioration due to increased uncontrolled discharges and damage to infrastructure. The research shows that the immediate and long-term implications resulting from these impacts are likely to be experienced widely across the social, cultural, environmental and economic domains. Examples include loss and damage to assets - leading to disruption to communities, water quality deterioration with consequential social, environmental, economic and cultural effects, public health risks, and economic costs related to damages, foregone production and insurance. Cultural implications are of particular importance in a New Zealand context, given the strong connection of Maori to the environment and water.

Changes in rainfall distribution during the monsoon months (June to September) of Bangladesh are evaluated in this study using quantile regression. Monthly rainfall data for the period 1961-2014 recorded at 18 locations distributed over the country were used for this purpose. Distributional changes of monthly rainfall showed downward convergent lines are dominant in peak monsoon months of June, July and August at 28%, 50% and 28% stations, respectively, followed by horizontally divergent lines at 17% of stations during those months. The dominating category of last monsoon month (September) rainfall was found upward divergent lines at 50% stations. The results revealed a decrease in many rainfall quantiles from June to August and increase in September in most of the stations. The increasing trend lines of September rainfall quantiles were found to become more diverse with time, which indicates an increase in rainfall extremes and the possibility of more floods which are already very common in the last month of monsoon in Bangladesh. The decrease in lower quantiles of rainfall in most of the monsoon months may cause an increase in the probability of droughts in the country. The study provided more insight on monsoon rainfall changes and improved understanding of climate change impacts on monsoon rainfall regime which can help in planning climate change adaptations in Bangladesh.

Assessing population exposure to coastal flooding due to sea level rise	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; SCALE; COMMUNITIES; PROJECTIONS; MIGRATION; EXTREME; IMPACTS; TIDE	The exposure of populations to sea-level rise (SLR) is a leading indicator assessing the impact of future climate change on coastal regions. SLR exposes coastal populations to a spectrum of impacts with broad spatial and temporal heterogeneity, but exposure assessments often narrowly define the spatial zone of flooding. Here we show how choice of zone results in differential exposure estimates across space and time. Further, we apply a spatio-temporal flood-modeling approach that integrates across these spatial zones to assess the annual probability of population exposure. We apply our model to the coastal United States to demonstrate a more robust assessment of population exposure to flooding from SLR in any given year. Our results suggest that more explicit decisions regarding spatial zone (and associated temporal implication) will improve adaptation planning and policies by indicating the relative chance and magnitude of coastal populations to be affected by future SLR. The exposure of populations to sea-level rise is a leading indicator assessing the impact of future climate change on coastal regions. The authors identify three spatial zones of flooding such as mean higher water, the 100 year floodplain and the low-elevation coastal zone and show population exposure can differ between those zones.

Climate change impacts and strategies for adaptation for water resource management in Indiana	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Water resources; Climate change; Water availability; Water quality; Indiana	VARIABILITY; EXTREMES	Changes to water resources are critical to all sectors of the economy. Climate change will affect the timing and quantity of water available in the environment as well as have an adverse effect on the quality of that water. Floods, droughts, and changing patterns of water scarcity-when water is not available in sufficient enough quantities or of a suitable quality at the right time to fulfill demand-are all critical factors when considering how and where Indiana will be able to economically develop in the future. Management of water resources will become even more important as different sectors try to minimize the risk of water scarcity in the face of increasing climate variability. This paper focuses on observed changes to Indiana's water resources and how the availability and quality of those resources are likely to change in the face of future climate. Generally, Indiana is becoming wetter but with the projected increase coming primarily in the winter and spring. Summer water use will increase the likelihood of water shortages and the need for improved water management. In particular, Indiana may benefit from investment in methods to increase short-term storage of water-retaining more of the overabundance from winter and spring to relieve summer shortages.

The applications refer to the estimation of coastal hazards on characteristic Mediterranean microtidal littoral zones and the calculation of failure probabilities of typical rubble mound breakwaters in Greek ports. The proposed methodology hinges on the extraction of extreme wave characteristics and sea levels due to storm events affecting the coast, a nonstationary extreme value analysis of sea-state parameters and coastal responses using moving time windows, a fitting of parametric trends to nonstationary parameter estimates of the extreme value models, and an assessment of nonstationary failure probabilities on engineered port protection. The analysis includes estimation of extreme total water level (TWL) on several Greek coasts to approximate the projected coastal flooding hazard under climate change conditions in the 21st century. The TWL calculation considers the wave characteristics, sea level height due to storm surges, mean sea level (MSL) rise, and astronomical tidal ranges of the study areas. Moreover, the failure probabilities of a typical coastal defense structure are assessed for several failure mechanisms, considering variations in MSL, extreme wave climates, and storm surges in the vicinity of ports, within the framework of reliability analysis based on the nonstationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The methodology supports the investigation of future safety levels and possible periods of increased vulnerability of the studied structure to different ultimate limit states under extreme marine weather conditions associated with climate change, aiming at the development of appropriate upgrading solutions. The analysis suggests that the assumption of stationarity might underestimate the total failure probability of coastal structures under future extreme marine conditions.

NOV.; USA; BACILLARIOPHYCEAE; ASSEMBLAGES; CONTAMINATION; PRODUCTIVITY; CHECKLIST	Climate change and human activities may alter the structure and function of boreal peatlands by warming waters and changing their hydrology. Diatoms can be used to assess or track these changes. However, effective biomonitoring requires consistent, reliable identification. To address this need, this study developed a diatom voucher flora of species found across a boreal fen gradient (e.g., vegetation) in interior Alaskan peatlands. Composite diatom samples were collected bi-weekly from three peatland complexes over the 2017 summer. The morphological range of each taxon was imaged. The fens contained 184 taxa across 38 genera. Eunotia (45), Gomphonema (23), and Pinnularia (20) commonly occurred in each peatland. Tabellaria was common in the rich and moderate fen but sparse in the poor fen. Eunotia showed the opposite trend. Approximately 11% of species are potentially novel and 25% percent matched those at risk or declining in status on the diatom Red List (developed in Germany), highlighting the conservation value of boreal wetlands. This voucher flora expands knowledge of regional diatom biodiversity and provides updated, verifiable taxonomic information for inland Alaskan diatoms, building on Foged's 1981 treatment. This flora strengthens the potential to effectively track changes in boreal waterways sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

Restoration of wetlands leads to a higher water-buffering capacity of the landscape, strengthening various ecosystem services, and fostering adaptation to climatic, ecological, and agricultural challenges. Such restoration efforts require extensive land-use change, leading to trade-offs in provisioning and regulating ES. However, knowledge is limited about these situations, especially in the case of lowland areas. Here, we introduce a hydrological analysis in a 243 km(2) flood-protected catchment in the Great Hungarian Plain, mapping the potential hydrological effects of water-retention scenarios on groundwater levels. We point out how the simulated groundwater levels will be used for estimating the changes in crop yields and tree growth (provisioning services). The introduced hydrological analysis and preliminary results for crop-yield estimates suggest a significant and scalable capacity for a nature-based hydrological adaptation: the extent of inundated areas could be increased stepwise and water retention could locally compensate dry periods due to the buffering effect of inundated meanders.

We first select 12 of the country's most exposed coastal municipalities using a Municipal Exposure Index (MEI). Then, we conduct a content analysis of the communal regulatory plans (CRPs) using a "presumed exposure analysis", which assumes that the inventory of assets within LECZ, according to the 2017 census, is a proxy of the exposure. Then, we conduct a more refined "hazard exposure analysis" by comparing changes in flooding levels between a historical period (1985-2004) and the RCP8.5 scenario (2026-2045). Using the latter approach, we show that flooding could affect large portions of the municipalities' housing areas (3.7%), critical facilities (14.6%), and wetlands (22.7%) in the period 2026-2045. In the presumed exposure analysis, these percentages rise to 7.5%, 23.9%, and 24.9%, respectively. We find that CRPs also allow for a densification of exposed residential areas, whose density would increase by 9.2 times, on average, between the historical period and the RCP8.5 scenario. Additionally, only four municipalities define floodable zones as "risk areas". Lastly, the difficulty in updating CRPs and their antiquity -21.25 years old on average could explain their ineffectiveness in implementing climate change adaptation strategies.

These phenomena, combined with Climate Change, threaten the capacity of sewer networks for safe conveyance of runoff. In this context, there is a need for efficient methods of modelling sewer networks, which are the main drainage systems used to deal with runoff accumulation. Hence, this research emerged to provide an efficient alternative to specialised stormwater software in terms of time and input requirements to model urban flooding. This was achieved through a methodology consisting of the combination of dependence measures in the form of factor and correlation analyses with machine learning classifier systems. The use of dependence measures enabled minimising the number of variables required by learning classifiers to perform as predictors in estimating node flooding in sewer networks. The proposed approach was tested in an urban catchment in Espoo (Finland), whose hydrological response had been previously calibrated and validated with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The comparison of the node flooding distribution across the catchment was carried out under different rainfall events associated with Climate Change. As a result, the methodology was demonstrated to be capable of reproducing the flooding results obtained both with SWMM and Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) approaches with high accuracy.

Prolonged and extreme rainfalls are recognized as main drivers of soil erosion, and climate change predictions for large parts of the world foresee such increases in precipitation. Erosion rates are additionally affected by land use, which may change as a result of the shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to an economy relying on using renewable biomass, a "Bioeconomy". In this study we aimed at investigating, through modelling, i) if future changes in land use, due to a bioeconomy, would increase the risk for soil loss and enhance suspended sediment yields in streams and ii) if these changes, when combined with climate change effects, would further aggravate suspended sedi-ment conditions in a catchment. We used hydrological and bias adjusted climate models to compare the effect of seven land use pathways on discharge and sediment transport relative to a baseline scenario under present and future climate conditions. The study was carried out based on data from a small headwater stream, represen-tative for cereal production areas of S-E Norway. By modelling our scenarios with the PERSiST and INCA-P models, we found that land use change had a greater influence on both future water discharge and sediment losses than a future climate. Changes from climate showed strongest differences on a seasonal basis. Out of the modelled land use pathways, a sustainable pathway manifested the least occurrence of extreme flood and sediment loss events under future climate; whereas a pathway geared towards self-sufficiency indicated the highest occurrence of such extreme events. Our findings show that careful attention must be placed on the land use and soil management in the region. To maintain freshwater quality, it will be increasingly important to implement environmental mitigation measures.

This study was conducted to develop a comprehensive methodology for enhancing flood resilience by improving society-wide disaster literacy under the governance formed through the active participation of all levels of stakeholders in Davao City, Philippines. Specifically, the development of the Online Synthesis System for Sustainability and Resilience, which integrates different disciplines, and the fostering of Facilitators, whose role is to interlink the science community and society, were implemented in a co-designing manner by the collective governance body. The development of basin- and barangay-scale hydrological models realized real-time flood forecasting and climate change impact assessment to identify intensified flood risk under the future climate. Co-designed e-learning workshops were held to foster about thirty Facilitators and help them produce twenty-one risk communication plans and workshop designs for fourteen barangays considering geographic, demographic, economic, and social features that they can utilize for public dissemination related to climate change adaptation to the target audiences in society. This paper presents a practical method to enhance flood resilience, demonstrating that the synthesis of science-based knowledge and human resource development can fill the gaps between the science community and society.

Humans' reactions to these catastrophes are influenced by their proximity to the hazards and their ability to anticipate, resist, cope with, and recover from their consequences. Due to climatic changes, the risk of multiple natural hazards is expected to increase in several regions of Pakistan. There is a pressing need to understand the spatial discrepancies of natural hazards due to climate change and identifying the regions that require special measures to increase resilience, achieve adaptation, and sustainable development goals. This paper synthesizes the related literature to understand spatial variations of natural hazards due to climate changes across Pakistan. The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Landslide Catalog (NASA-GLC), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) are utilized to analyze spatial discrepancies and vulnerabilities to natural hazards. This study unveils that Pakistan's current risk analysis and management strategies seem to be obsolete compared to global trends. Because of spatial variations of hazards, most research work on hazard risk assessments and risk management focuses on a single hazard, neglecting the co-occurrence impact of different natural hazards. Very limited studies are included in comprehensive multi-hazard risk strategies. Therefore, in Pakistan, risk management would require integrated multi-hazard risk assessment approaches to detect, analyze, measure, and evaluate various natural hazards, their effects, and interconnections. Moreover, the Pakistan governmental institutes dealing with natural hazards should focus on pre-disaster mitigation and resilience techniques instead of investing only in post-disaster relief activities.

Climate change, land use change, and increased exposure in hazard prone areas play a role in increasing pluvial flood risks. We describe a methodology for rapid probabilistic pluvial flood hazard mapping and risk assessments in urban environments developed for the Copernicus Climate Change Service "Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Areas" demonstrator project for large computational domains. The methodology is designed to be flexible and robust enough to be adapted to other cities in Europe and elsewhere, and is composed of three main steps: (i) computation of the intensity-frequency relationship to express the depth of extreme hourly rainfall events at the urban scale; (ii) characterization of the pluvial flood hazard by means of raster-based flood modeling, and; (iii) estimation of the direct tangible damages at the building level for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Methods are tested for 20 cities across Europe and considering two infiltration rate scenarios. Spatial-explicit results at the urban-scale highlight the neighborhoods and sub-urban areas more adversely affected in terms of direct tangible damage to buildings and assets. Probabilistic risk assessment results indicate that Brussels, Antwerp, and London are the cities with higher expected annual damages per built-up area among the 20 cities considered in this study. These results can be useful for supporting the implementation of the Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030, for developing multi-hazard risk assessments, and for supporting the development of national climate change adaptation plans.

Optimal timing of mangrove rehabilitation under climate change uncertainty	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Natural disasters; Mangrove rehabilitation; Real options; Forest management	REAL OPTIONS; ECONOMIC VALUATION; FLOOD RISK; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; CONSERVATION; PROJECT; ISLAND	Climate change poses a variety of threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human lives. Mangrove forest is one of the key nature-based solutions that address climate change and its impacts while providing socio-economic and ecological services. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, various national and local governments are considering mangrove rehabilitation as a natural defense to these threats. This study aims to assess the value of mangrove rehabilitation by focusing on the ecological goods and services it provides as well as the cost of the project at different implementation periods. We apply a real options-based trinomial tree model to evaluate the optimal timing of making an investment decision for the rehabilitation project under uncertainty in climate change damage cost. Validating the model using the Philippines as a case, the results found that the economic benefits from the mangrove forest, including the market value of forestry and fishery products, protection from climate-related damages, carbon sequestration, and ecotourism, exceeded the investment cost for the rehabilitation project. Considering the uncertainty in damage costs from natural disasters, the real option valuation gave a higher total investment value which described a more optimal decision to postpone the implementation of the mangrove rehabilitation. However, the results found conditions in the model to invest immediately when the frequency of natural disasters and their associated damage costs significantly increased. The implications of the results recommend government policies to enable the realization of mangrove rehabilitation as a nature-based solution addressing the Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Disaster Risk Reduction global agendas of transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies.

However, climate change impacts on precipitation, temperature and sea-level combined with land subsidence, upstream hydropower development, and water infrastructures (i.e. high-dykes construction) are altering the hydrological regime of the VMD. This study investigates future changes in flood hazard and agricultural production caused by these different scales of human-induced stresses. A quasi- two-dimensional (quasi-2D) hydrodynamic model was used to simulate eight scenarios representing the individual and compound impacts of these drivers for a baseline (1971-2000) and future (2036-2065) period. The scenarios map the most likely future pathway of climate change (RCP 4.5) combined with the best available Mekong upstream hydropower development, and land subsidence scenarios as well as the current delta development plan. We found that sea-level rise and land subsidence would cause the highest changes in flood hazard and damage to rice crop, followed by hydropower and climate change impacts. Expansion of high-dyke areas in two northernmost delta provinces (An Giang and Dong Thap) would have the smallest impact. The combination of all modelled drivers is projected to increase delta inundation extent by 20%, accompanied with prolonging submergence of 1-2 months, and 2-3 times increase in annual flood damage to rice crops in the flood-prone areas of the VMD. These findings of likely increasing risk of tidal induced flood hazard and damage call for well-planned adaptation and mitigation measures, both structural and non-structural.

Regional Inequalities in Flood Insurance Affordability and Uptake under Climate Change	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; flood risk management; insurance; socio-economic tipping-point; adaptation; partial equilibrium modeling	HEALTH-INSURANCE; RISK INSURANCE; DISASTER RISK; FUTURE; IMPACTS; PROTECTION; PREMIUMS; DATABASE; GERMANY; EVENTS	Flood insurance coverage can enhance financial resilience of households to changing flood risk caused by climate change. However, income inequalities imply that not all households can afford flood insurance. The uptake of flood insurance in voluntary markets may decline when flood risk increases as a result of climate change. This increase in flood risk may cause substantially higher risk-based insurance premiums, reduce the willingness to purchase flood insurance, and worsen problems with the unaffordability of coverage for low-income households. A socio-economic tipping-point can occur when the functioning of a formal flood insurance system is hampered by diminishing demand for coverage. In this study, we examine whether such a tipping-point can occur in Europe for current flood insurance systems under different trends in future flood risk caused by climate and socio-economic change. This analysis gives insights into regional inequalities concerning the ability to continue to use flood insurance as an instrument to adapt to changing flood risk. For this study, we adapt the "Dynamic Integrated Flood and Insurance" (DIFI) model by integrating new flood risk simulations in the model that enable examining impacts from various scenarios of climate and socio-economic change on flood insurance premiums and consumer demand. Our results show rising unaffordability and declining demand for flood insurance across scenarios towards 2080. Under a high climate change scenario, simulations show the occurrence of a socio-economic tipping-point in several regions, where insurance uptake almost disappears. A tipping-point and related inequalities in the ability to use flood insurance as an adaptation instrument can be mitigated by introducing reforms of flood insurance arrangements.

Understanding the response of arterial traffic systems to flood risks in sensitive delta area is vital for the operation of the regional economy and society. This study examined the impacts of the temporal and spatial changes in rainfall on flood risks in traffic systems in the Yangtze River Delta in China. We constructed a framework for assessing flood risk in the arterial traffic system under changing rainfall regimes. Thirteen representative spatial indices enabled calculation of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, producing associated flood risk values. Results show an increase, during 1960-2017, in rainfall-related flood risks for the arterial traffic system in the Yangtze River Delta. In particular, the proportion of areas with medium and high risk levels increased over 20 %. These results suggest a strong correlation between increasing flood risks and the spatial and temporal patterns of changing rainfall regimes under global climate change. Changes in rainfall, therefore, are important in assessing and managing the risks posed by floods, in the Yangtze River delta and other similar urbanized sensitive river deltas.

The concept of urban resilience has been growing in response, since it allows us to understand city behaviour as a system of systems, improving its response to extreme climate-related events. This paper presents the EU H2020 Resilience to Cope with Climate Change in Urban Areas (RESCCUE) project approach in Lisbon's research site, regarding the Hazur(R) resilience assessment methodology. This methodology focuses on the interdependencies between services and infrastructures, and on the recovery times needed to restore its normal functionalities. This approach allows the integration of several work packages of the RESCCUE project, from climate change projections to adaptation strategies selection. The assessment was conducted for 19 services and 146 infrastructures, including water (supply and drainage systems), power, mobility, waste, telecommunication, environment, and the social sector. The principal climate-related hazard analysed at the Lisbon research site was urban flooding. The main result consists of a deep understanding of the relations between different services and the consequent cascade effects triggered by flooding events. Stakeholders' involvement, beyond the project consortium, was fundamental for the success of the methodology implementation.

Imagining a specific, personal episode where you experience consequences of climate change in the future (episodic future thinking) may bring climate change closer, thus increasing the perceived risk of climate-related risk events. We conducted an experiment to test whether episodic future thinking increased the perceived risk of climate-related risk events and climate change in general, as compared to thinking about the future in a general, abstract manner (semantic future thinking). We also tested whether this effect is moderated by how easy it is to imagine the specific climate-related risk event initially. Participants were randomly assigned to an episodic future thinking-condition or a semantic future thinking-condition, and two of the risk events in each condition were related to flooding (difficult to imagine) and two were related to extreme temperature (easy to imagine). The results show no main effect of episodic future thinking on perceived risk, and no interaction effect with imaginability. Contrary to expectations and earlier research, this suggests that episodic future thinking may not influence risk perception.

The current paper determines the influence of climate change on the dairy sector in Pakistan. Comprehensive data set was collected from 450 farmers. The majority of farmers experienced the climate change and its variability and explained that severity and frequency of climatic extreme events such as droughts, heat waves, floods, pests and diseases and humidity is increasing. The study found that farmers considered drought as one of the major climatic risks which severely affects all aspects of dairy production. Specifically, to estimate the perceived impacts of climatic extreme event on milk production, an ordered probit model was applied and identified that climate change had high adverse impact on milk quantity in the study area. Different adaptation practices, such as changing cropping pattern for fodder production, off-farm income activities, diversifying the farm and regular vaccination are mostly used by dairy farmers. The study recommends policy initiatives to be taken by government for long term developments in the dairy farming.

Rhesus macaques build new social connections after a natural disaster	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALOUATTA-PIGRA; PRACTICAL GUIDE; CHACMA BABOONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE; BEHAVIOR; MODELS; POPULATION; SUPPORT; STRESS	Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts. Understanding resilience and vulnerability to these intense stressors and their aftermath could reveal adaptations to extreme environmental change. In 2017, Puerto Rico suffered its worst natural disaster, Hurricane Maria, which left 3,000 dead and provoked a mental health crisis. Cayo Santiago island, home to a population of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), was devastated by the same storm. We compared social networks of two groups of macaques before and after the hurricane and found an increase in affiliative social connections, driven largely by monkeys most socially isolated before Hurricane Maria. Further analysis revealed monkeys invested in building new relationships rather than strengthening existing ones. Social adaptations to environmental instability might predispose rhesus macaques to success in rapidly changing anthropogenic environments.

In this paper, climate change impacts on streamflow are explored using soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) in one of the tropical watersheds, Wabi Shebele River Basin of Ethiopia. Regional climate model (RCM) from CORDEX-Africa region is used to analyze the basin's hydrological responses to climate forcing in the projected period. The result indicates that, the watershed is likely to experience an increase in flood hazard with an increase in precipitation in the future as temperatures increase less than 2 degrees C. Flood hazard indices showed a larger value at downstream of the river station (i.e., Gode) and a smaller value at the upper and middle stations with no change in climate variables (i.e., the baseline scenario, T thorn 0 degrees C, P thorn 0%). Based on separation method analysis, climate change has a greater impact on the streamflow and flood hazards in the region during the last four decades. Model uncertainty analysis reveals that simulated seasonal streamflow using RCMs has similar oscillation patterns to streamflow using observed climate data within uncertainty bands (UBs) in the study area with NSE and R-2 values greater than 0.75 and 0.92, respectively.

The devasting impact of climate change has come to our attention, with much hotter and drier conditions, and with more frequent and intense flooding events. Some extreme events have reached a dangerous level, increasingly threatening human lives. The interconnected risks caused by these extreme disaster events are triggering a chain effect, forcing us to respond to these crises through changes in our living environment, which affect the atmosphere, the biosphere, the economy including the availability of energy, our cities, and our global society. Moreover, we have to confront the abnormal consequences of untypical, rapid changes of extreme events and fast switches between extreme states, such as from severe drought to devastating flooding. Recognizing this new situation, it is crucial to improve the adaptation capacity of our societies in order to reduce the risks associated with climate change, and to develop smarter strategies for climate governance. High-quality development must be science-based, balanced, safe, sustainable, and climate-resilient, supported by the collaborative governance of climate mitigation and adaptation. This article provides some recommendations and suggestions for resilience building and collaborative governance with respect to climate adaptation in response to a new planetary state that is characterized by more frequent and severe extreme weather events.

J	Henrique, KP; Tschakert, P				Henrique, Karen Paiva; Tschakert, Petra			Taming Sao Paulo's floods: Dominant discourses, exclusionary practices, and the complicity of the media	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Newspaper; Framing; Climate change; Cities; Adaptation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEWS MEDIA; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS; RIGHTS; KNOWLEDGE; PATHWAYS; POLITICS; RISK	Climate change leads to more frequent and severe flooding, urging cities to adapt to protect their populations and assets. Despite exacerbated hazards, governments repeatedly draw on 'tried-and-true' approaches to protect the status quo, often with serious adverse effects for the poor and vulnerable. Yet, such dominant approaches do not go unchallenged as the media and other actors prompt public debate to assess flood impacts, scrutinise government decisions, and perhaps even promote alternative practices. News outlets are not, however, balanced or value-free; the events portrayed and the voices (and knowledges) recognised and included in media coverage deeply influence whether and how flooding is incorporated in policy. Focusing on Sao Paulo, Brazil, we examine how the media framed flood events and conveyed solutions during the city's worst floods in recorded history. We demonstrate how competing media outlets largely depicted flooding as a natural phenomenon to be solved by governments and experts through existing techno-managerial practices, mirroring governmental partisan plans for adaptive action. In doing so, the media failed to offer a democratic space for public discussion, citizen contestation, and the advancement of alternative trajectories for adaptation. We posit that inclusive trajectories that address entrenched vulnerabilities and projected climate change will benefit from rigorous ethical debates around the media's role in disaster coverage while strategically leveraging alternative media outlets as public pedagogy and agenda-setting tools.

The rapid urban growth rate together with the acceleration of Climate Change are boosting negative impacts on a wide range of coastal socioecological systems around the globe: as exposure, vulnerability, and the frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic hazards increase, so does disaster risk. Controlling exposure is the most efficient way of reducing flood risk; to this end, urban and infrastructure engineering design and planning processes should work hand in hand. Nonetheless, defining the "acceptable" risk level is not a technical question; it requires evidence-based guidance from "experts", but sustainable solutions can only be reached through social negotiation processes conducted in the political arena. New forms of coastal governance should be devised.

Agriculture is a very prominent sector of the Indian economy accounts for (49%) of the employment and one-sixth of the GDP. The agricultural industry is supported by 500 million small holder farms. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable for climate change and water as well. Climate change affects agriculture in the Asia and Pacific region particularly in those areas that are vulnerable to natural disasters. Higher temperature reduce yield of desirable crops while encouraging weeds and pests proliferation. Changes in precipitation pattern and floods affect agriculture causing crop failures. In India, significant negative impacts occurred due to climate change reasoned to reducing the yields. In addition to advisory services advanced information on likelihood of weather help to carry out to proper management of resources for agricultural operations to minimize the risk and facilitate growth and realizes the optimum crop yield. Further, decentralization of extension services tracing the different state or district-level funding is needing exercise not always known at national level in various states or provinces spending on extension service. It plays a prominent role by creating awareness regarding adaptation of best practices regarding climate change, deforestation and planting of trees also potential to transform the vision of India's famers about food security, poverty alleviation and sudden climatic threats. Thus, the advisory services help taking the advantage of benevolent weather and minimize adverse impact of malevolent weather.

Fluvial sediment is one of the best archives for the investigations of high-resolution environmental variability and anthropogenic impacts on catchment over the last hundreds or even thousands years (Anthropocene). In this study, we examine magnetic properties of a 130-year fluvial sediment profile from an island in the main channel of the lower Yangtze mainstream, which aims to determine the connections between modern observational data and paleoclimate signals from sediments. Sediments from the upper Yangtze River is characterized by high concentration of magnetite, which is different from the middle reach. The difference of magnetic properties allows us to trace particles in the lower reach back to upstream of the Yangtze River. Climate change that reconstructed from physical properties of sediment (susceptibility and mean grain size) is comparable to those records in historical documents, which provides a possible way to obtain precise ages. The calibrated sedimentation rate reflects long-term variation of flood/drought events over the catchment, which is dominantly controlled by the climate circulation of Pacific. The enhanced human impacts since 1950s especially in the mid-lower reaches are observed. Therefore, riverine sediment not only contains paleoclimate information, but also reflects human activities.

Hence adaptation by incorporating infrastructures is essential, but it has been seldom explicitly included in the simulations projecting climate change impacts on flood risk in these countries. Quantifying the effects of infrastructure is the key to climate change impact and adaptation assessment. Therefore, this study was conducted in the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB) in Thailand to examine the adaptation potential of (i) existing structural and non-structural measures that include reservoir and diversion dams, diversion canals, and water retention areas, and (ii) the combined adaptation measures, a combination of alterations made to the existing diversion canals and retention areas, on reducing future floods using the H08 global hydrological model (GHM). The results revealed that the impact of existing measures on the future flood reduction was smaller than the increase caused by warming in the CPRB. Conversely, the combined adaptation measures successfully mitigated the effect of warming by redirecting nearly 50 % of the diverted river flow to the ocean and storing 30 % of the diverted flow in the retention areas. Although a remarkable reduction was noted in the basin-wide flood risk, the effect of adaptation measures greatly varied across the basin. The combined adaptation measures largely reduced the number of flooding days by close to 100 at many of the considered stations within the basin, except for extreme flood events (historical 1 percentile flood events). This further reveals that the feasibility of adaptation measures in alleviating the extreme future floods will be limited in flood-vulnerable basins and thus require area-based prioritization for flood management. The modelling framework implemented in this study can be easily adapted to different GHMs and regions and should be examined for their applicability.

The annual air temperature increased by 1.7 degrees C from 8.6 degrees C in 1958 to 10.3 degrees C in 2017 over the last 60 years and similarly in the vegetation period (1 April-30 October) from 13.7 degrees C in 1958 to 15.2 degrees C in 2017 by 1.5 degrees C. The combination of stronger increase in winter temperatures (by +1.2 degrees C) than in the summer (air +1.0 degrees C) with advanced bud break and -0.3 degrees C lower minimum temperatures in April during flowering resulted a continued risk of a late frost, as experienced in 2017. The strongest climate change effect, i.e., 11-14 days advanced flowering (in apple and pear) highly correlated (R-2 -0.7) with the March/April temperature. Fruit ontogeny was 4 days shorter in cv. 'Lucas' pear, but 5 days longer in cv. 'Cox' and 10 days longer in cv. 'Boskoop', but remained unchanged in cv. 'Golden Delicious', irrespective of early or late ripening variety and contradictory climate effects, fruit matured 4-12 days earlier indicating its sole dependency on variety. Climate data and (earlier) harvest date closely correlated (R-2: 0.6-0.7). The lowest correlation was between canopy duration (bloom to leaf fall), which was consistently extended by 6-10 days and the leaf drop stage beginning 2-4 days earlier. The correlations indicated that the Meckenheim fruit growing region is strongly affected by climate change and the comparison between two equally-balanced 30-year phases gave more realistic results than linear curve fitting.

In particular, the impacts on shallow groundwater levels, which can lead to both flooding and drought, have major implications for agriculture, adaptation, and urban planning. Predicting such hydrological impacts is typically performed using physically based hydrological models (HMs). However, such models are computationally expensive, especially at high spatial resolutions. This study is based on the Danish national groundwater model, set up as adistributed, integrated surface-subsurface model at a 500 m horizontalresolution. Recently, a version at a higher resolution of 100 m was created, amongst others, to better represent the uppermost groundwater table and to meet end-user demands for water management and climate adaptation. However, the increase in resolution of the hydrological model also increases computational bottleneck. To evaluate climate change impacts, a large ensemble of climate models was run with the 500 m hydrological model, while performing the same ensemble run with the 100 m resolution nationwide model was deemed infeasible. The desired outputs at the 100 m resolution were produced by developing a novel, hybrid downscaling method based on machine learning (ML). Hydrological models for five subcatchments, covering around 9 % of Denmark and selected to represent a range of hydrogeological settings, were run at 100 m resolutions with forcings from a reduced ensemble of climate models. Random forest (RF) algorithms were established using the simulated climate change impacts (future - present) on water table depth at 100 m resolution from those submodels as training data. The trained downscaling algorithms were then applied to create nationwidemaps of climate-change-induced impacts on the shallow groundwater table at 100 m resolutions. These downscaled maps were successfully validated against results from a validation submodel at a 100 m resolution excluded from training the algorithms, and compared to the impact signals from the 500 m HM across Denmark. The suggested downscaling algorithm also opens for the spatial downscalingof other model outputs. It has the potential for further applications where, for example, computational limitations inhibit running distributedHMs at fine resolutions.

This study offers a multifaceted approach to understanding socioenvironmental vulnerability in cities by considering fine-scale spatial distribution of social and physical metrics overlaid with runoff and surface temperature (ST) data. Stormwater runoff depth and surface temperature data for micro-subbasins in Philadelphia were estimated and integrated to create an environmental vulnerability index. Social variables representing poverty, the elderly population, population density, and buildings with basements were used to develop a social vulnerability index. Simple analysis based on medians of combined environmental and social vulnerability indexes identified specific subbasins of the city that are most vulnerable to heat and flooding impacts of climate change. Hotspot analysis of combined social and environmental vulnerability data identified regions of the city that would benefit most from a focus on implementation of new green-blue infrastructures. Results indicated that neighborhoods in southern Philadelphia are most vulnerable to flooding and heat. The outlined approach can be used for any city, and provides city managers with a city-scale visualization for prioritizing areas in immediate need of climate mitigation practices.

Hence, developing a proper reservoir desilitation strategy is an urgent issue to ensure that the water resources can be sustainable development worldwide. This study aims to investigate the release efficiency of the bypass tunnel in the reservoir. Firstly, a 2D numerical model was adapted to reproduce the most severe sedimentation disaster due to Typhoon Aere and obtain a reliable result compared with the measured data. Then, the concept of climate change was embedded to understand the release capability of the bypass tunnel under slight to worst scenarios. Finally, the bypass tunnel is demonstrated to be effective in releasing sediment during typhoon periods and prolong the reservoir lifespan. In conclusion, this study proposes a proper solution to reservoir sedimentation during extreme flooding event. The optimization of water resources and economic benefits can help reservoir management achieve the goal of sustainable development. The presented research can be promoted in the worldwide reservoir to face the possibly severe sediment disaster under the threat of climate change.

Within Pakistan, Punjab province is a leading regional producer of food and cash crops, and an exporter of agricultural commodities of significance in South Asia. Punjab agriculture provides livelihoods for agriculture-dependent communities living in one of the most populous countries of the world and these will be disrupted under incremental climate changes (e.g. rising temperatures) and the impacts of extreme climate events (such as droughts and floods). Climate impact assessments and mapping are widely accepted initial approaches to address climate change as they have the potential to facilitate bottom-up adaptation. However, to date, policy responses in Pakistan have tended to be top-down, driven by national adaptation planning processes. This paper assesses agricultural vulnerability to impacts of climate events at the district scale for Punjab province by developing maps of the individual components of vulnerability, i.e. exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. An indicator-based approach using a composite index method was adopted for the assessment. The mapping separated and categorised districts in Punjab based on their vulnerability to climate change and revealed spatial patterns and factors influencing district-level vulnerability. These geospatial variations in vulnerability illustrate the need for a nuanced policy on adaptation that recognises the importance of local biophysical and socio-economic context to build adaptive capacity for vulnerable regions rather than the current concentration on broad-scale top-down action embedded in National Adaptation Plans.

For example, infrastructure with a long lifespan now needs to be designed or adapted to account for a future climate that will be different from the past or present. There is a growing necessity for the climate information used in decision making to change from traditional science-driven metrics to decision-driven metrics. This is particularly relevant in East Africa, where limited adaptation and socio-economic capacity make this region acutely vulnerable to climate change. Here, we employ an interdisciplinary consultation process to define and analyse a number of such decision-oriented metrics. These metrics take a holistic approach, addressing the key East African sectors of agriculture, water supply, fisheries, flood management, urban infrastructure and urban health. A multifaceted analysis of multimodel climate projections then provides a repository of user-focused information on climate change and its uncertainties, for all metrics and seasons and two future time horizons. The spatial character and large intermodel uncertainty of changes in temperature and rainfall metrics are described, as well as those of other relevant metrics such as evaporation and solar radiation. Intermodel relationships amongst metrics are also explored, with two clear clusters forming around rainfall and temperature metrics. This latter analysis determines the extent to which model weights could, or could not, be applied across multiple climate metrics. Further work must now focus on maximising the utility of model projections, and developing tailored risk-based communication strategies.	[Bornemann, F.

A case study of a test catchment in Guangzhou illustrated changes of peak runoff under various climate scenarios. There were distinct increases in runoff volume and peak discharge in response to RCP8.5 but only marginal increases in response to RCP2.6 (compared with present conditions). The performance of PP and BCs in terms of percentage reduction of runoff volume and peak discharge was examined for 1-, 10-, and 100-year return period and 1- and 6-h-duration storms under various climate scenarios. The effectiveness of PP and BCs varied non-linearly with the extent of PP and BCs adopted. In general, the fluctuation of hydrological performance of PP is greater than that of BCs in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (e.g., peak flow reductions range from - 60% to 69% and from - 22% to 9%, for 5% area of PP and BCs, respectively). And PP is more cost-effective for frequent storms using life cycle costing analysis. We find that PP and BCs could significantly reduce runoff volume and peak discharge in response to rainfall events with short return period, but not for heavy storms with longer return period.

This study evaluates the potential effects of climate change on river discharge and inundation in the Magdalena River basin, the main river in Colombia, using the synergy between the MGB (Modelo de Grandes Bacias) hydrological-hydrodynamic model and downscaled Eta-regional climate model (RCM) projections based on four global climate models (GCMs): BESM (Brazilian Earth System Model), CanESM2 (Canadian Earth System Model), MIROC5 (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Version Five), and HadGEM2-ES (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2). We used two different greenhouse gas scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway)) for the "historical" (1986-2005) and "mid-term prospective" (2046-2065) periods. Model results for the "mid-term prospective" period under scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 indicate increase in mean river discharges in the east portion of the basin, decreased river discharges (mainly in the dry season) in the upper Magdalena basin, and increased inundation extent. By coupling hydrological-hydrodynamic and GCMs/RCMs models, modelling frameworks like the one used in this study provide an effective management tool for stakeholders interested in potential climate change impacts on tropical river basins.

Potential hydro-meteorological impacts over Burundi from climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Burundi; Climate change; CORDEX; Extremes; Impacts on hydrology; SWIM	PRECIPITATION; AFRICA; ROBUSTNESS; ENSEMBLE; MODEL	Study region: Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and hence very vulnerable to climate change. It is covered by the Kagera, Malagarasi, and Tanganyika River basins. Study focus: We investigated the hydro-climatic impacts of climate change over Burundi projected by an ensemble of 19 regional climate models and an eco-hydrological model in two future periods under the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. New hydro-climatic Insights: We found a robust increase in annual and seasonal average temperature over Burundi in all scenarios, characterized by a significant annual rising trend along the 21st century and the increase in every single month, especially in the dry season (up to 5.2 degrees C under RCP8.5-P2). Precipitation would increase in the north, except in February and September. In the south, precipitation would decrease throughout the year, particularly in the onset and offset of the rainy season and from December to February. This would entail the prolongation and severity of the long and short dry periods. These changes generate increases in the long-term annual mean discharges in North Burundi (up to 44% in small catchments and 29% in larger ones). In southern Burundi the discharge would decrease along the year (up to -16.8%) with exception of November-December in the southeast (up to 27.9%). Besides, the higher daily extreme river discharges found over the Ruvubu basin imply a higher risk of floods.	[Rivas-Lopez, M.

Assessment of future rainfall for the Brahmani-Baitarani river basin - practical implications of limited data availability	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						bias-correction; Brahmani-Baitarani river basin; climate change; data availability; downscaling; India	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS; BIAS CORRECTION; EXTREME RAINFALL; CHANGE IMPACT; VARIABILITY; INDIA; PROJECTIONS; FREQUENCY; EVENTS	Severe floods are common in the Brahmani-Baitarani river basin in India. Insights into the implications of climate change on rainfall extremes and resulting floods are of major importance to improve flood risk analysis and water system design. A wide range of statistical and dynamical downscaling and bias-correction methods for the generation of local climate projections exists. Yet, the applicability of these methods highly depends on availability of meteorological data. In developing countries, data availability is often limited, either because data do not exist or because of restrictions on use. We here present a climate change analysis for the Brahmani-Baitarani river basin focusing on changes in rainfall using data from three GCMs from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that were selected based on their performance. We apply and compare two widely used and easy to implement bias-correction methods. These were selected because reliable open historical meteorological datasets required for advanced methods were not available. The results indicate likely increases in monsoon rainfall especially in the mountainous regions and likely increases in the number of heavy rain days. We conclude with a discussion on the gap between state-of-the-art downscaling techniques and the actual options in regional climate change assessments.	[Dahm, R. J.; Weiland, F. C.

Using the HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models, the study evaluates future flow patterns and the potential repercussions of dam breaches. The following summary of the work: firstly, the HEC-HMS model is calibrated and validated using daily stage-discharge observations from the Basantpur station. With coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.764 and 0.858 for calibration and validation, respectively, the model demonstrates satisfactory performance. Secondly, The HEC-HMS model predicts future flow for the Hirakud Reservoir under three climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and for three future periods (near future, mid future and far future). Thirdly, by analyzing time-series hydrographs, the study identifies peak flooding events. In addition, the HEC-RAS model is used to assess the effects of dam breaches. Downstream of the Hirakud Dam, the analysis highlights potential inundation areas and depth variations. The study determines the following inundation areas for the worst flood scenarios: 3651.52 km2, 2931.46 km2 and 4207.6 km2 for the near-future, mid-future and far-future periods, respectively. In addition, the utmost flood depths for these scenarios are determined to be 31 m, 29 m and 39 m for the respective future periods. The study area identifies 105 vulnerable villages and several towns. This study emphasizes the importance of contemplating climate change scenarios and implementing proactive measures to mitigate the peak flooding events in the Hirakud reservoir region.

Adaptation will be a critical strategy to reduce community vulnerability, but requires a change in land management behaviors, the capacity for which is affected by a wide range of social-psychological factors.ObjectivesBecause much of the USA coastal landscape is privately owned, success of climate change adaptation strategies in communities depends on landowner support. We take a step in determining coastal community resilience by identifying the factors influencing landowners' adaptation decisions.MethodsWe used a stated preference experiment, administered via household survey in rural coastal North Carolina, USA, to elicit landowners' climate change adaptation intentions. We combined survey responses with spatial data on landowner- and landscape-characteristics to map adaptation support for the study area. We identified the set of scenarios resulting in the greatest adaptation benefit by overlaying models of sea level rise.ResultsWe found adaptation support was higher for forest landowners than agricultural landowners; both preferred programs with higher payments and shorter contract lengths. Adaptation by neighboring landowners increased support, regardless of payment level or contract length. Maps of adaptation support did not directly align with objective risk maps, highlighting the need to consider diverse socio-spatial characteristics driving decision-making.ConclusionsBy integrating social preference data with landscape models, we mapped the aggregate impacts of social processes on the location of intended adaptation. Results from this study can motivate resource managers to consider diverse social-psychological factors as they develop climate change adaptation incentives for long-term resilience.

J	Webber, MK; Samaras, C				Webber, Marissa K.; Samaras, Constantine			A Review of Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty Applications Using Green Infrastructure for Flood Management	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Review						decision making; deep uncertainty; green infrastructure; flood management; climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; SEA-LEVEL RISE; ADAPTIVE POLICY PATHWAYS; LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; MITIGATION STRATEGIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SCENARIO DISCOVERY	Decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) approaches are well-suited for making decisions about infrastructure to manage flooding exacerbated by climate change. One important system for climate resilience and flood management is green infrastructure, which refers to a network of natural and semi-engineered areas that provides ecosystem functions. Green infrastructure is often characterized as a low-regret strategy with multiple co-benefits under uncertainty. These attributes enable green infrastructure to be an important adaptation strategy under DMDU frameworks for flood management. However, DMDU analyses that include green infrastructure are still relatively limited, perhaps due to computational or modeling complexity and other barriers. This paper identifies and reviews publications in the flood management literature that use DMDU frameworks and refer to green infrastructure adaptation strategies, in order to identify trends and inform future research. The reviewed publications are categorized according to a variety of performance metrics, climate change scenarios, DMDU metrics, and hydrologic modeling techniques, and represent several adaptation strategies applied to case studies on five continents using a range of data sources and assumptions. This paper highlights a number of solutions that can be employed to facilitate additional research at the intersection of these fields. Primary among these is the transparent documentation and use of open source models, methods, and data. Future research should also focus on communication among different stakeholders, particularly in ensuring definitions, assumptions, and data requirements are clear. These partnerships can facilitate effective application of robust strategies such as green infrastructure for urban adaptation to the effects of climate change.

Fishers' vulnerability encompasses several factors and includes, among others, their sensitivity, exposure to the elements, and their adaptive capacity. The main aim of this study was to help develop a vulnerability assessment tool that can be applied in the various nodes of the fisheries and aquaculture value chains with a long-term view of enhancing the resilience of the fisheries and helping increase the adaptive capacity of the fishing communities. A participatory technique using online workshops was conducted together with various stakeholders (N = 214) who gave insights and suggested indicators that drive climate change impacts and vulnerability. Based on the online workshops conducted, the common hazards/drivers were increasing temperature, typhoons, flooding (sealevel rise), and the recent pandemic, which consequently destroy coral reef ecosystems, affect fisheries yield, increases fish mortality, damage boats, fishing gears, pens, cages, pond dikes, erode beach properties, and devastate houses. In association with these impacts, mobility, travel, processing, and logistic operations are severely reduced. In the human dimension, the fishers and fish farmers are directly affected in terms of income loss, destroyed fishing gears, nutritional deficiencies and health impacts, less fishing operations, early or reduced harvest yield, and low market value of products. In the adaptation options, the infrastructure, social, economic, awareness/knowledge, and relevant governance/policy dimensions are needed to address and help mitigate various climate change impacts.

We used the object-oriented classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify six types of land uses. The series of land-use maps we produced had an overall accuracy of more than 80%. We then conducted a spatial analysis of the 5-year land-use change using ArcGIS software. In addition, we surveyed 150 farm households using a structured questionnaire regarding the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and land uses, as well as farmers' adaptation and responses. The results showed that from 2005 to 2020, cropland decreased, while aquaculture land and forest land increased. We observed that the most remarkable decreases were in the area of rice (485.58 ha), the area of perennial crops (109.7 ha), and the area of non-agricultural land (747.35 ha). The area of land used for aquaculture and forest increased by 566.88 ha and 772.60 ha, respectively. We found that the manifestations of climate change, such as extreme weather events, saltwater intrusion, drought, and floods, have had a profound impact on agricultural production and land uses in the district, especially for annual crops and aquaculture. The results provide useful information for state authorities to design land-management strategies and solutions that are economic and effective in adapting to climate change.

It destabilizes wheat production mainly through abiotic stresses (heat waves, drought, floods, frost, salinity, and nutrient deficiency) and improved conditions for pest and disease development and infestation as biotic parameters. The impact of these parameters can be reduced by timely and appropriate management measures such as irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide application. However, this requires the early diagnosis and quantification of the various stressors. Since they induce specific physiological responses in plant cells, structures, and tissues, environmental stress parameters can be monitored by different sensing methods, taking into account that these responses affect the signal in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM), especially visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR). This study reviews recent findings in the application of remote and proximal sensing methods for early detection and evaluation of abiotic and biotic stress parameters in crops, with an emphasis on winter wheat. The study first provides an overview of climate-change-induced stress parameters in winter wheat and their physiological responses. Second, the most promising non-invasive remote sensing methods are presented, such as airborne and satellite multispectral (VIS and NIR) and hyperspectral imaging, as well as proximal sensing methods using VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy. Third, data analysis methods using vegetation indices (VI), chemometrics, and various machine learning techniques are presented, as well as the main application areas of sensor-based analysis, namely, decision-making processes in precision agriculture.

Geological formations have huge potential for underground CO2 storage and therefore, present viable options for storing CO2 and reduction of greenhouse gases in general and CO2 in particular. This review outlines the various techniques, strengths and pitfalls associated with the various techniques applied to the three major geological formations used for carbon sequestration. The advantages of the various techniques are enormous and generally vary from one geological formation to the other. The applicability of these techniques, which is based on data from various sources including laboratory studies, numerical modelling, pilot field testing and commercial carbon capture projects have been documented in key literature for various regions of the world. Despite the immense advantages of carbon capture and utilization, Sub-Saharan Africa is still lagging and is yet to fully delve into this trajectory of research owing to a lack of interest, dearth of research funding and expertise. This review will highlight the various perspectives of carbon capture and storage that may help solve some of the problems burgeoning the energy industry as well as mitigate climate change problems, thus triggering the required thrust for research in the area.

The aim of this study is to assess the observed and projected climate changes in Backa (Serbia). Detailed trend analyses and possible climate scenarios over Backa has not been presented up to now. In this paper, four data sets were extracted and calculated: mean annual air temperature, mean air temperatures during the vegetation period, mean annual precipitation and total precipitation during the vegetation period. The presented parameters were obtained from the annual meteorological reports of the Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia. Trend equation based on linear regression, trend magnitude according to the trend equation, and Mann-Kendall statistics have been used for trend analysis of climatic parameters. A GIS modeling of the possible climate scenario was created according to the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM2-MR). Based on the trend equations. positive trends related to air temperature and precipitation variables are dominant. The trend magnitude shows the largest mean increase in all time series related to air temperature during the vegetation period. The highest mean precipitation increase occurs only in two time series. The Mann-Kendall statistics showed significantly positive trends in 11 cases and no changes in 9 cases. According to BCC-CSM2-MR, changes will be especially dominant in case of air temperatures. The expected changes in the total precipitation during the vegetation period show a tendency towards semiarid conditions. The presented results of observed and projected climate changes demand adaptation measures, especially from the aspect of sustainable agriculture.

Projections indicate an average increase of the intensity of the summer Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) between 18 and 30% by 2100. Greater PMP could affect the performance and integrity of mining infrastructure (berms, dams, spillways), and increase the risk of dike overtopping (a common mechanism for dike failure in the mining industry). In this paper, an approach using projected PMPs from regional climate models to design surface water management infrastructure is proposed and applied on a real mine site in Abitibi. Clavet-Gaumont and Hershfield PMP calculation methods are presented and compared. Rainfall and runoff were measured at Canadian Malartic Mine to characterize the rainfall-runoff characteristics of waste rock piles and tailings storage facilities. Field measurements were used to calibrate a numerical model and quantify the projected impact of climate change on runoff following extreme rainfall events. The effect of temporal rainfall distribution, waste rock/tailings initial conditions and catchment geometry on runoff were also studied. Results show that the peak discharge of summer/fall PMP could increase significantly, up to 49% considering Representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. The choice of the approach used to estimate PMP could cause major differences in the design of surface water infrastructure. The RCP scenario was also identified as a major cause for uncertainty in the projection of peak discharges.

Peaking at 4808 m asl, the Mont-Blanc summit, at the boundary between France and Italy, is the highest of the Alps, in Western Europe. Its Massif is world-famous for outdoor and extreme sport activities, especially since the 1924 Olympic games held in Chamonix. Here, we use a novel statistical downscaling approach to regionalize current and future climate change over the Mont-Blanc Massif at an unequalled spatial resolution of 200 m. The algorithm is applied to daily minimum and maximum temperature derived from global climate models used in the fifth assessment report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This new high-resolution database allows for a precise quantification of frost occurrence and its evolution until 2100. In the winter season and by the end of the 21st century, under a pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5), frost frequency in the morning could decrease by 30-35 percentage points in the valley of Chamonix, and in the afternoon, similar changes could occur for elevations comprised between 2000 and 3000 m. In summertime, changes are even larger, reaching a huge drop of 45-50 points in the afternoon between 3500 and 4500 m. These changes are much reduced under an optimistic scenario. They could have huge impacts on the environment (glacier shrinking, permafrost degradation, floods, changes in the distribution of species and ecosystems) and societies (summer tourism for climbing and hiking, and winter tourism for skiing).

How might climate change impact water safety and boil water advisories in Canada?

Studies show that small communities in Canada are particularly likely to experience repeat and long-term BWAs. Climate change has led to changes in precipitation and temperature patterns, leading to regionspecific impacts such as increased frequency, severity, or variance in floods, forest fires, droughts, freezing rain, and sea water intrusion. Academic and non-academic "grey" literature was reviewed to establish the most likely impacts of climate change on water treatment and infrastructure. Anonymized data from public drinking water systems in Canada was analyzed to determine the most common causes of BWAs between 2005 and 2020. Most BWAs reported were related to breakdowns/malfunctions along the distribution, though inadequate disinfection residual and turbidity or coliforms in the treated water were also common. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the data showed seasonal trends in some of these parameters. The results of this study suggest that increased precipitation, flooding, permafrost degradation, and forest fires are likely to have significant impacts on water safety in Canada.

Therefore, effective climate adaptation strategies for urban rail transit (URT) should be adopted to cope with extreme precipitation events (EPEs). This study proposes a decision-making model based on climate change for drainage renovation, which consists of an optimal renovation sequence model and an optimal investment timing model. This study analyzes the inundation risk of each station and its node importance in the URT network and then uses a multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) to determine the optimal renovation sequence. This study also uses a real options pricing approach to calculate the value of an option in order to defer the renovation project and determine the optimal investment timing. Then, the Beijing Urban Rail Transit (BURT) is taken as an example to conduct an empirical analysis of the proposed model. Considering the uncertainty of climate change and the complexity of the URT network, the model can obtain the optimal renovation sequence and the investment timing of each station, which is expected to provide a decision-making tool for urban governments to formulate an optimal plan that strengthens the prevention of flooding disasters.

Climate change adaptation is needed to address structural failures and safety concerns. Despite recognizing the need for support from stakeholders and adaptation of infrastructure, the level of adaptation activity remains limited and inconsistent across regions and communities in rural Alaska. We address this need by identifying barriers to community-wide adaptation of infrastructure based on stakeholder perspectives who make adaptation decisions for government agencies, nonprofits, engineering firms, or academic institutions in rural Alaska. Barriers were identified qualitatively through interviews (N = 25) and validated quantitatively through surveys (N = 30). Qualitative and quantitative results identified and validated 17 barriers to adaptation of infrastructure - spanning sociocultural, institutional, economic, physical, and environmental dimensions based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF). Results demonstrate the need for national adaptation funding and policy that is specific to the diverse cultural landscapes, extreme weather, rural locations, limited transportation, and high costs in rural Alaska. Adaptation funding and policy is needed that supports the collaboration of Alaska-based institutions, such as nonprofit organizations and engineering firms, Tribal entities, and rural Alaska community representatives in adaptation.

Incorporating recent developments in inundation modelling, here we show a 26.4% (24.1-29.1%) increase in US flood risk by 2050 due to climate change alone under RCP4.5. Our national depiction of comprehensive and high-resolution flood risk estimates in the United States indicates current average annual losses of US$32.1 billion (US$30.5-33.8 billion) in 2020's climate, which are borne disproportionately by poorer communities with a proportionally larger White population. The future increase in risk will disproportionately impact Black communities, while remaining concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Furthermore, projected population change (SSP2) could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of these risks. Climate change is increasing flood risk, yet models based on historical data alone cannot capture the impact. Granular mapping of national flood risk shows that losses caused by flooding in the United States will increase substantially by 2050 and disproportionately burden less advantaged communities.

Climate change impacts namely severe floods, droughts, extreme temperatures and storms are hindering attainment of sustainable livelihoods to most populations. This study sort to analyze the contribution of climate smart interventions targeting enhancement of sustainable livelihoods in Chiredzi District's agricultural rural communities. Interventions have been implemented by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) (CARE & PLAN) in collaboration with Government departments and communities. A pragmatist research philosophy encompassing both interpretivist (qualitative) and positivist (quantitative) paradigms was adopted to comprehensively answer research objectives. Household survey questionnaire was the main quantitative tool administered to randomly selected households. Interviews were conducted with purposively selected key informant interviewees from the Department of Agriculture Technical and Extension services, CARE, PLAN International, District Development Coordinator and Rural District Council. Adoption of climate smart interventions by 60.6% of the respondents in communities studied yielded notable successes whereby it enhanced sustainable livelihoods through ending poverty amongst vulnerable communities. Some, 67% of the respondents did fodder production to manage livestock production challenges induced by climate change. It also improved community well-being by increasing sources of livelihoods. The study recommends adoption of more climate smart interventions that ensures livelihood sustainability.

This research investigates the runoff and energy production in the current and future climate for the Tekeze hydropower plant located in the Tekeze river basin in the northern part of Ethiopia. The rainfall-runoff model HBV and the hydropower simulator nMAG were used to generate runoff and energy production in the current and future climate. A combination of five regional climate models and seven global climate models from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment were used to generate bias-corrected scenarios for the future climate. The result shows an increase in future runoff which was shown to be due to an increase in precipitation. However, the current operational strategy of the power plant did not utilize the future runoff in an optimal way. Therefore, based on the projected future inflow, we have developed a new reservoir operational strategy to preserve water for power production. As a result, the energy production was increased, and the flood spill from the reservoir reduced. This shows the need to adapt the hydropower production system to the future flow regimes to get the most out of the available water.

This is because changes in land use due to socio-economic development increase runoff, as well as the "values-at-stake" exposed to flooding. At the same time, changes in flood extent and depth can impact land use via policy interventions aimed at reducing future flood risk, such as buy-backs and zoning. Existing approaches to flood risk assessment and mitigation have generally ignored this two-way interaction between flooding and land use. To address this shortcoming, an integrated framework considering the dynamics of future changes in the flood-land use nexus is introduced and applied to the Gawler River region, South Australia. Results indicate that changes in land use due to socio-economic drivers can have a significantly greater impact on flood losses than climate change and that zoning can be effective in reducing future flood risk.

In this paper we use both reanalysis and observations to perform a statistical and dynamical attribution of this precipitation event to climate change. We define 1948-1977 as the counterfactual period and 1990-2019 as the factual one. The statistical attribution is based on fitting the generalized extreme value distribution for 3-days averaged precipitation annual maxima for the two periods, while the dynamical attribution aims at looking at the recurrence properties of sea-level pressure and geopotential height patterns in both periods. We find that the dynamics of the event consists in an unprecedented combination of several factors: a tropical atmospheric river, the presence of the Coral low pressure system and a blocking anticyclone offshore Eastern Australia. Our main finding is that no clear attribution statements can be made, both because of the unprecedented nature of this event, the lack of long high quality available data and the dependence of the results on the La Nina phase of El Nino Southern Oscillation.

Sazzadur Rahman; Luo, Jianchao; Liang, Hu			Factors affecting farmers' willingness to adopt crop insurance to manage disaster risk: evidence from Bangladesh	INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						flood risk; climate change; crop insurance; willingness to pay; agriculture	CLIMATE-CHANGE BELIEFS; DROUGHT-PRONE; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTIONS; STRATEGIES; DIVERSIFICATION; DECISIONS; PROVINCE	Climate change and climate-related disasters have had a major impact on agriculture and agricultural livelihoods in Bangladesh, threatening the food security of the entire nation. Non-structural measures such as crop insurance have been recommended as risk management tools for farmers but have not been implemented because of a lack of supporting policies, expertise, and lack of information about farmers' willingness to adopt such strategies. This study aims to fill that research gap by exploring the factors influencing agricultural producers to purchase crop insurance. Primary data were collected from three districts (Mymensingh, Barisal, and Comilla) that are prone to flooding. A multinomial logit model was adopted to investigate the relationships among dependent and explanatory variables. The results indicate that age, loan size, distance from the major river, farming experience, farming type, and risk attitude affect farmers' willingness to pay for crop insurance. Government subsidies and increased awareness of the benefits of crop insurance could improve the outlook for the agricultural sector and help medium and subsistence farmers maintain their livelihoods. The results also provide valuable guidance for local, national, and international stakeholders.

J	Urama, NE; Eboh, EC; Onyekuru, A				Urama, Nathaniel E.; Eboh, Eric C.; Onyekuru, Anthony			Impact of extreme climate events on poverty in Nigeria: a case of the 2012 flood	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						climate change; flood; adaptation; poverty; expenditure; households; agriculture		This study analysed the impact of the 2012 flood that occurred in Nigeria on households' chance of entering into poverty, using a panel analysis of covariance model and data from the Nigerian General Household Survey of 2011 and 2013. The result of the analyses showed that though the 2012 flood did not significantly affect the per capita expenditure of all the surveyed households, it may have significantly decreased the per capita expenditure of households located in the flood affected areas and were heavily dependent on agriculture for their income. More so, the effects were not uniform across the households as the result showed that the effects were more on female-headed households compared to male-headed households, and more on households that had no access to credit compared to those that had access to credit. These lead to the recommendation that efforts should be made to integrate adaptation to climate change into poverty alleviation/eradication programmes in the country by ensuring that farmers prone to flood and other extreme climate-related disasters have access to finance. They should also be trained on how to build resilience, adaptive, anticipatory and absorptive capacity to climate change, giving priority to female-headed household that earn their living from agriculture.

In this study, we identified DWAA events, including dry-wet (D-W) alternation events and wet-dry (W-D) alternation events, based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA), and analyzed temporal and spatial variation of DWAA during the period 1976-2015. Over the entire study period, GLRCA experienced an overall wetting trend, and a heavy dry trend was mainly distributed in the southwest. Although both D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events showed a slight decrease at the regional scale, there were two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996-2015, with a decrease in 1976-1995 and an increase in 1996-2015. Spatially, the variation in the number of D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events exhibited a large heterogeneity. A significant increase in the frequency of D-W alternation events and W-D alternation events was observed in the southwest of arid climate zone, which may be attributed to the increased frequency of dry months and wet months in the region. This study in DWAA events is of importance to the implementation of water resources management, disaster prevention and mitigation policies in the GLRCA under the challenge of future climate change.

J	He, XG; Pan, M; Wei, ZW; Wood, EF; Sheffield, J				He, Xiaogang; Pan, Ming; Wei, Zhongwang; Wood, Eric F.; Sheffield, Justin			A Global Drought and Flood Catalogue from 1950 to 2016	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; FERTILE CRESCENT; WATER-RESOURCES; RETURN PERIOD; UNITED-STATES; SURFACE-WATER; VIC-2L MODEL; LAND	Hydrological extremes, in the form of droughts and floods, have impacts on a wide range of sectors including water availability, food security, and energy production. Given continuing large impacts of droughts and floods and the expectation for significant regional changes projected in the future, there is an urgent need to provide estimates of past events and their future risk, globally. However, current estimates of hydrological extremes are not robust and accurate enough, due to lack of long-term data records, standardized methods for event identification, geographical inconsistencies, and data uncertainties. To tackle these challenges, this article presents the development of the first Global Drought and Flood Catalogue (GDFC) for 1950-2016 by merging the latest in situ and remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art land surface and hydrodynamic modeling to provide a continuous and consistent estimate of the terrestrial water cycle and its extremes. This GDFC also includes an unprecedented level of detailed analysis of drought and large-scale flood events using univariate and multivariate risk assessment frameworks, which incorporates regional spatial-temporal characteristics (i.e., duration, spatial extent, severity) and global hazard maps for different return periods. This Catalogue forms a basis for analyzing the changing risk of droughts and floods and can underscore national and international climate change assessments and provide a key reference for climate change studies and climate model evaluations. It also contributes to the growing interests in multivariate and compounding risk analysis.

The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods, droughts, and heatwaves) have hurt lives, displaced communities, destroyed logistics networks, disrupted the flow of goods and services, and caused delays, capacity failures, and immense costs. This study presents a strategic approach we term "Climate-Change Resilient, Sustainable Supply Chain Risk Management" (CCR-SSCRM) to address CC risks in supply chain management (SCM) pervading today's business world. This approach ensures supply chain sustainability by balancing the quadruple bottom line pillars of economy, environment, society, and culture. A sustainable supply chain analytics perspective was employed to support these goals, along with a systematic literature network analysis of 699 publications (2003-2022) from the SCOPUS database. The analysis revealed a growing interest in CC and supply chain risk management, emphasizing the need for CCR-SSCRM as a theoretical guiding framework. The findings and recommendations may help to guide researchers, policymakers, and businesses. We provide insights on constructing and managing sustainable SCs that account for the accelerating impacts of CC, emphasizing the importance of a proactive and comprehensive approach to supply chain risk management in the face of CC. We then offer directions for future research on CCR-SSCRM and conclude by underlining the urgency of interdisciplinary collaboration and integration of climate considerations into SCM for enhanced resilience and sustainability.

J	Lee, YC; Liu, YF				Lee, Ying-Chieh; Liu, Ya-Fang			Co-benefits of preserving urban farmland as climate change adaptation strategy: An emergy approach	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Urban farmland; Urban green infrastructure (UGI); Co -benefits; Climate change adaptation; Nature -based solutions (NBS); Emergy	AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; SOCIOECONOMIC METABOLISM; AREAS; SUSTAINABILITY; URBANIZATION; CONSERVATION; FRAMEWORK; INSIGHTS	The potential of urban green infrastructure (UGI) for adapting to climate change has been recognized, but the inclusion of urban farmland as a measure of nature-based solutions (NBS) and its co-benefits to alleviate flood risk has rarely been assessed. This case study of the Guandu Plain in Taipei City assesses the co-benefits of using urban farmland as an NBS measure to adapt to extreme climate events. Five alternative land use practices (increasing the ridge height of paddy rice fields, citizen farming, simple leisure farms, nursery gardens, and large nature parks) were proposed to assess their co-benefits when using existing farmland to alleviate flood risks; cobenefits were also identified through a workshop. Emergy synthesis was applied to estimate the inflows of energy and materials, performance, costs, and environmental sustainability of each alternative land use practice. Results indicated that all proposed alternative land use practices had higher co-benefits than traditional practices such as paddy rice fields. The use of earth banks to withhold excess runoff improved renewable energy flows and decreased environmental loading by reducing inflow energies from the economic system. Citizen farming had the highest return of co-benefits. Our findings suggest that the use of UGI to alleviate excess runoff and other benefits can co-exist with use for adaptation to extreme climate events. NBS are an important concept and should be integrated into land use planning to promote urban farmland as an effective UGI strategy to adapt to climate change.

Thus, this study investigated modifications in precipitation and temperature patterns using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and shuffling technique. The novelty of this study lies in exploring the influence of climate change on precipitation and temperatures from a novel nonlinear dynamic perspective. The temperatures and precipitation data regarding central England (1931-2019) were analyzed by multifractal theory. The results demonstrated that the sources of precipitation and temperature multifractal patterns altered owing to climate change on the daily and monthly scales. Concerning maximum temperature ( T-max), on a daily scale, multifractal patterns with probability density function (PDF) origin were intensified, whereas, on a monthly scale, multifractal patterns with long-range correlations (LRC) source were amplified. Regarding precipitation and minimum temperature ( T-min), on a daily scale, multifractal patterns with LRC origin were strengthened, whereas, on a monthly scale, multifractal patterns with PDF source were augmented. On a daily scale, multifractality of precipitation and T-max increased by 85.66% and 87.37%, respectively, and regarding T-min, decreased by 7.28%. The multifractal patterns of precipitation were dependent on the T-min multifractal patterns. It was concluded that alterations in drought and flood patterns were consequences of variations in the multifractal source of T-min patterns. The present study contributes to understanding the mechanism of climate change impacts on multifractal patterns of precipitation and temperatures and furnished references for multifractal studies of precipitation and temperatures.

J	Ceribasi, G; Ceyhunlu, AI				Ceribasi, Gokmen; Ceyhunlu, Ahmet Iyad			Generation of 1D and 2D flood maps of Sakarya river passing through Geyve district of Sakarya city in Turkey	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Global warming; Climate change; Precipitation; Flood; Geyve; Sakarya	MODEL; URBANIZATION	In recent years, changes in precipitation caused by climate change resulting from global warming lead to great floods in world. This climate change causes drought in some regions, whereas it causes heavy rainfall in some other regions. Investigating the effects of large floods as a result of heavy rains is of great importance. Turkey is among countries affected by climate change as a result of global warming due to its location. Extreme rainfall has caused great floods in country. Although the effect of these floods cannot be phased out completely, it is important to establish flood models to minimize them. Being the third longest river in Turkey, Sakarya river frequently exposes town Geyve in Sakarya Province to floods. The occurrence of these floods can be affected by sudden and severe rainfall, as well as negative interventions made by people living in this region. Therefore, it is very important to model flood that may occur as a result of heavy rains in Geyve district of Sakarya river in study. In order to establish this flood model, first and foremost recurrence flows of 100 and 500 years will be determined, then digital terrain model will be prepared in ArcGIS software, and 1- and 2-dimensional flood dispersion maps will be established with Hec-RAS software.

Indigenous Hlth Adaptation Climate	Neglected Tropical Diseases in the Context of Climate Change in East Africa: A Systematic Scoping Review	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article							INDIGENOUS HEALTH; TRANSMISSION; SCHISTOSOMIASIS; LEISHMANIASIS; CHALLENGES; RISK	East Africa is highly affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which are projected to be exacerbated by climate change. Consequently, understanding what research has been conducted and what knowledge gaps remain regarding NTDs and climate change is crucial to informing public health interventions and climate change adaptation. We conducted a systematic scoping review to describe the extent, range, and nature of publications examining relationships between NTDs and climatic factors in East Africa. We collated all relevant English and French publications indexed in PubMed (R), Web of Science T Core Collection, and CAB Direct (c) databases published prior to 2019. Ninety-six publications were included for review. Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia had high rates of publication, whereas countries in the Western Indian Ocean region were underrepresented. Most publications focused on schistosomiasis (n = 28, 29.2%), soil-transmitted helminthiases (n = 16, 16.7%), or human African trypanosomiasis (n = 14, 14.6%). Precipitation (n = 91, 94.8%) and temperature (n = 54, 56.3%) were frequently investigated climatic factors, whereas consideration of droughts (n = 10, 10.4%) and floods (n = 4, 4.2%) was not prominent. Publications reporting on associations between NTDs and changing climate were increasing over time. There was a decrease in the reporting of Indigenous identity and age factors over time. Overall, there were substantial knowledge gaps for several countries and for many NTDs. To better understand NTDs in the context of a changing climate, it would be helpful to increase research on underrepresented diseases and regions, consider demographic and social factors in research, and characterize how these factors modify the effects of climatic variables on NTDs in East Africa.

Identifying leverage points in climate change migration systems through expert mental models	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Migration; Causal relationships; Hazard; Mental models	INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; DISPLACEMENT; RESILIENCE; COMPLEXITY; DECISIONS; INSIGHTS; THINKING	As the impacts of climate change increase, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change advises that global migration will also increase. A deeper understanding of the factors and interactions that influence the migration decision-making of climate-affected populations is needed to more accurately predict migration estimates and adequately inform and prepare future receiving cities. In this study, we survey thirty-two experts in the field of climate migration to explore how demographic, economic, environmental, political, and social factors interact to lead to climate (im)mobility and how these interactions change within sea level rise, drought, flooding, and erosion contexts. We use system mapping and network analysis to determine which factors should be targeted as leverage points for policy makers and their resulting effects within each hazard context. Our findings identify physical infrastructure, social services, social capital, and political stability as places to intervene to increase resiliency in drought, flooding, and erosion climate migration systems. Using hazard context and community consultation, we recommend selecting target factors with direct relationships to other highly influential factors (livelihoods, food security, and financial capital) to elicit the most positive cascading effects through the whole system, leading to changes in migration. We also highlight the sea level rise climate migration system as highly complex in comparison to the other contexts examined and the need for multi-factored interventions in this context to create more resilient migration systems. Our findings contribute to the growing body of work which seeks to better understand the interactions between factors influencing climate migration.

Study focus: Streams and rivers of the Australian tropics have been the subject of substantial hydrological process research spanning the last 50 years. In this review, we highlight initial efforts to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics, and how this has been more recently followed by work in savannas of the seasonal tropics. We describe recent findings from modelling and tracer studies and derive a framework of dominant hydrological processes for the region. We also detail five critical knowledge gaps that will require further attention with climate change and ongoing interest in development in the region. New hydrological insights for the region: We outline the diversity of runoff generation mechanisms that prevail in the region and emphasise the role of connected wetlands and floodplains in catchment response. We discuss the prominence of focused, episodic recharge in the replenishment of groundwater stores across the region. We also review how climate change and potential water resource development projects may alter the hydrology of northern Australian catchments. Future research should focus on improving our physical understanding of key hydrological processes, as well as anticipate the likely effects of development and climate change on these processes. Intensive and long-term studies of experimental observatories, which capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region, will help frame sustainable water development policies in northern Australia.

The Mekong River is among the world's large-scale rivers severely affected by climate change. This study aims to define the duration of precipitation contributing to peak floods based on its correlation with peak discharge and inundation volume in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). We assessed the changes in precipitation and flood frequency using a large ensemble Database for Policy Decision-Making for Future Climate Change (d4PDF). River discharge in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and flood inundation in the LMB were simulated by a coupled rainfall-runoff and inundation (RRI) model. Results indicated that 90-day precipitation counting backward from the day of peak flooding had the highest correlation with peak discharge (R-2= .81) and inundation volume (R-2= .81). The ensemble mean of present simulation of d4PDF (1951-2010) showed good agreement with observed extreme flood events in the LMB. The probability density of 90-day precipitation shifted from the present to future climate experiments with a large variation of mean (from 777 to 900 mm) andSD(from 57 to 96 mm). Different patterns of sea surface temperature significantly influence the variation of precipitation and flood inundation in the LMB in the future (2051-2110). Extreme flood events (50-year, 100-year, and 1,000-year return periods) showed increases in discharge, inundation area, and inundation volume by 25%-40%, 19%-36%, and 23%-37%, respectively.

Alterations to feedbacks between important eco-physical structuring processes driven by climate change may modulate river morphology, floodplain characteristics, and their biological communities. Current understanding is reviewed and synthesised to explore the potential responses, mechanisms, and ramifications of climatic shifts for the European riverscape. Fundamental drivers of change are expected to be (a) disturbance deviation beyond the historical norm and (b) vegetation morphodynamics, a key river process where ecological and fluvial-geomorphological attributes interact to shape the physical environment. Increased seasonal temperature, summer drought, and winter flooding may affect the colonisation, growth, and mortality of plant species with consequences for riverscape structure and function as succession patterns adjust with repercussions for hydraulics and sediment dynamics. Such opposing winter and summer climate regimes are likely to impact vegetation patch dynamics, reflected in an increasingly variable patch mosaic as disturbance intensity deviates further from historical background conditions. How changes to climate drivers manifest themselves in individual river systems will also be affected by attributes such as catchment topography, geology, vegetation type, and previous human alterations. Where large scale change occurs, it will have consequences for the type and function of biological communities inhabiting the riverscape. Conventional engineering responses to meteorological disturbance will amplify the effect on river biota by reducing their ecological resilience, highlighting the need for a management response that integrates ecological and societal benefits simultaneously.

Cultural resources, such as historic buildings, in coastal areas are vulnerable to climate impacts including inundation, deterioration, and destruction from sea-level rise and storm-related flooding and erosion. However, research that assesses the trade-offs between actions for protecting vulnerable and valuable cultural resources under budgetary constraints is limited. This study focused on developing a decision support model for managing historic buildings at Cape Lookout National Seashore. We designed the Optimal Preservation Decision Support (OptiPres) model to: (a) identify optimal, annual adaptation actions for historic buildings across a 30-year planning horizon, (b) quantify trade-offs between different actions and the timing of adaptation actions under constrained budgets, and (c) estimate the effectiveness of budget allocations on the resource value of historic buildings. Our analysis of the model suggests that: (1) funding allocation thresholds may exist for national parks to maintain the historical significance and use potential of historic buildings under climate change, (2) the quantitative assessment of trade-offs among alternative adaptation actions provides generalizable guidance for decision makers about the dynamics of their managed system, and (3) the OptiPres model can identify cost-efficient approaches to allocate funding to maintain the historical value of buildings vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Therefore, the OptiPres model, while not designed as a prescriptive decision tool, allows managers to understand the consequences of proposed adaptation actions. The OptiPres model can guide park managers to make cost-effective climate adaptation decisions for historic buildings more transparently and robustly.

The aim of this article is to review, analyse and discuss in detail the problems faced by urban ecosystems due to water surplus and scarcity, as well as the need of adaptation to climate change taking into account the legislation, current challenges and knowledge gaps. The literature review indicated that urban floods are much more recognised than urban droughts. Amongst floods, flash floods are currently the most challenging, which by their nature are difficult to monitor. Research and adaptation measures related to water-released hazards use cutting-edge technologies for risk assessment, decision support systems, or early warning systems, among others, but in all areas knowledge gaps for urban droughts are evident. Increasing urban retention and introducing Low Impact Development and Nature-based Solutions is a remedy for both droughts and floods in cities. There is the need to integrate flood and drought disaster risk reduction strategies and creating a holistic approach.

Accordingly, the Flood Risk Management Act was amended in 2015 to use the anticipated maximum scale precipitation (AMSP) for flood inundation calculation. In order to estimate the AMSP, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) chose historical maximum areal precipitation in the form of duration-area-depth (DAD) curves rather than climate change projections' dataset d4PDF. In this paper, policy development and detailed estimation procedures for the AMSP were reviewed and discussed. It was concluded that the current climate change projections are still not accurate enough to be used as the basis for real local operations, while long accumulated ground observations and ground-based radars are available in good quality all over Japan. But at the same time, historical maximum should always be updated as past records are renewed. Also, regional partitioning should not be done at too coarse of scale for proper regionalization of DAD. Such strategy would serve as a useful reference for other nations.

The solution of the model was obtained using a new proposed analytical method, which is an elegant combination of asymptotic and Laplace methods. The result obtained showed that this method is a very powerful and efficient technique for finding the analytical solution of nonlinear fractional differential equation. From the analysis of the result, we observed that the impact of anthropogenic climate change on arctic sea-ice could lead to flooding in many coastal areas and low-lying island nations.

In this study, the objective was to predict the response of environmental flow components in a typical North African rivers network to future climate change. The study watershed is Bouregreg watershed (BW) in Morocco. To achieve this objective, a hybrid approach was build based on the semi-distributed model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration program (IHA). Data of two emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from a downscaled Global Circulation Model were used to force the hybrid SWAT-IHA to calculate modifications of BW's environmental flow components in 2085-2100 period. Results showed that BW will experience climatic changes under both scenarios. Most of the environmental flow attributes will be modified within the study period: loss of natural flow variability due to shift in exceedance probability of low flows (up to 40%), decrease of monthly low flows, forward shift in high flow timing (up to 50%), and alteration of both the duration and the rise rates of floods. BW's streams responded unequally to the simulated changes in terms of the altered attributes as well as the degree of the alteration. This study confirmed the ability of the developed modeling approach to monitor environmental flow parameters for the first time in Morocco, and contributed in highlighting the necessity of proactive long term strategies to protect riverine ecosystems in North Africa watersheds.

We investigate HPE properties describing their propagation, scale and intensity, by applying a storm tracking algorithm in an ensemble of convection permitting regional climate models (cpRCMs) under the CMIP5-RCP85 forcing scenario. The climate change response of HPE properties we derive by comparing their mean values for periods nearfuture [2040, 2050] and farfuture [2090, 2100] against those of a present-day period historical [1996, 2005]. By the end of the 21st century the model ensemble projects the region's surface temperatures to increase by 4.0 ?. In this warmer climate HPEs are found to propagate farther and faster. They last longer by 5%, their area increases by 15% and their precipitation volume by 35%. Their maximum precipitation rate increases by 13% and an estimate of severity is found increased by 20%. By differentiating specific HPE categories, regions and seasons we find that landfalling and orographically forced HPEs occurring in fall are most intense, heavy and severe. Most importantly we find that these events are also projected to respond most strongly to climate warming, meaning that they will be even more intense, heavy and severe. Consequently in Mediterranean regions the most dramatic changes must be expected, in particular in Southern Italy. But also in regions north of the Alps, where HPEs are generally weaker than to the south, HPEs are found to occur twice as often in wintertime accompanied with an increase in precipitation volume of about 50%. Our analysis also confirms that even though the Mediterranean climate is generally drier by the year 2100, precipitation amounts associated with HPEs are found to increase by 52%. Further HPEs are projected to be 12% more frequent overall, although their occurrence frequency decreases in summer. Eventually we show that the characteristic HPE properties scale with surface warming, meaning that the warmer the local climate is, the more frequent, intense, heavy and severe are HPEs. Notably statistical tests show that the ten-member cpRCM ensemble provides robust climate change responses of all HPE properties investigated. The projected changes of HPE properties infer an increase of flooding risk for communities of the Alpine-Mediterranean area and thus the results presented here may encourage local authorities in adapting their flood protection measurements to climate change.

This paper intends to provide a better understanding of the nature of interactions between climate change and events that undermine peace through a systematic review of recent literature. It highlights major methodological approaches adopted in the literature, elaborates on the geographic focus of the research at the nexus of climate change and peace, and provides further information on how various climatic stressors, such as extreme temperature, floods, sea-level rise, storms, and water stress may be linked to different events that undermine peace (e.g. civil conflict, crime, intercommunal violence, interstate conflict, political conflict, and social conflict) through direct and indirect pathways. Results confirm previous findings that statistical techniques and qualitative case studies are dominant methods in climate-conflict research but show that there has been an increase in the geographic information system based risk analyses and qualitative comparative analyses in the recent years. In line with previous reviews, results show that the literature is mainly focused on certain regions of the world and several major regions that have experienced numerous conflicts over the past few years and/or are vulnerable to adverse climatic events are understudied. However, a new finding is that, in the past few years, there has been an increasing focus on Asia, which contrasts with previous reviews that show an African focus in the literature. Also, there is an unbalanced attention to different climatic stressors and peace-related events. Interactions between water stress/extreme temperature and civil and interstate conflicts have received more attention. A major finding is that, only under certain conditions climatic stressors may act as driving forces or aggravating factors. In fact, there is a strong consensus that climate change is less likely to undermine peace in isolation from a wide range of contextual socio-economic and institutional factors such as political instability, poor governance, poverty, homogeneous livelihood structures, and ethnic fractionalization. However, such contextual factors can contribute to undermining peace via either direct or indirect pathways. The former may occur through direct psychological/physiological effects of climatic impacts or via competition over scarce resources. In contrast, in indirect pathways climate change may lead to conflict through diminishing livelihood capacities and/or inducing migration. In addition to synthesizing literature on contextual factors and direct/indirect pathways, the review identifies gaps that need further research.

However, the impact of future climate change on estuarine circulation is widely unknown. Here, we developed and calibrated a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for Pensacola Bay, a shallow subtropical estuary in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Model simulations based on years 2013-2017 were applied to examine changes in salinity, temperature, and density under future climate scenarios, including increased radiative forcing (IR) and temperature (T), increased freshwater discharge (D), sea level rise (SLR), and wind intensification (W). Simulations showed that the impacts of climate change on modeled state variables varied over time with external forcing conditions. The model demonstrated the potential for sea level rise and increased freshwater discharge to episodically increase vertical density gradients in the Bay. However, increased wind forcing destabilized vertical gradients, at times reducing the spatial extent and duration of stable stratification. For time periods with low freshwater discharge, moderate increases in wind speed (10%) can destabilize density gradients strengthened by increased discharge (10%) and sea level rise (0.48 m). In contrast, destruction of strong density gradients that form near the mid-Bay channel following flood events requires stronger wind forcing. These results highlight the importance of considering natural variability in freshwater and wind forcing, as well as local phenomena that are generally unresolved by global climate models.

Climate model outputs provide a leading source of information to quantify the effect of the foreseen natural and anthropogenic climate change on the environment and natural systems. However, modelling climate change impact on peak flow is subject to considerable uncertainties from the climate model discrepancies, bias correction methods, and hydrological model parameters. This study develops a framework to examine changes and disentangle uncertainties in peak flow, which is tested at five Awash catchments in Ethiopia, a region exposed to extreme flood risk. The results showed that projected extreme precipitation and peak flow magnitude could increase substantially in the coming decades by 30% to 55%. The uncertainty analysis confirms that the dominant factor in peak flood projection is climate models in catchments like Akaki (55%) and Awash H (51%), but the bias correction methods in Awash B (58%) and Kela (50%), respectively. The least important factor is the hydrological parameter set for flood projections. Moreover, the findings reveal that peak flood risks would noticeably increase in the near and far future in all catchments, in Awash located in the Tropical dry region. Therefore, various state water agencies from local to national scales must take certain non-structural/structural measures to mitigate flood risks in the future, and to adapt to future climate.

J	Weinstein, L; Rumbach, A; Sinha, S				Weinstein, Liza; Rumbach, Andrew; Sinha, Saumitra			Resilient Growth: Fantasy Plans and Unplanned Developments in India's Flood-Prone Coastal Cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						flood risk; flooding; climate change; climate resilience; India; Kolkata; Mumbai; disaster mitigation; resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; RISK; ADAPTATION; CITY; INFORMALITY; KOLKATA	Academic and policy literatures on urban climate resilience tend to emphasize 'good planning' as the primary means for addressing the growing risk of flooding in Asia's coastal megacities. Cities have come to rely on disaster and climate resilience plans to future-proof their landscapes and protect vulnerable populations. Yet while data is collected, models are built and plans are drafted, environmentally destructive development practices continue unabated and often unchallenged. This article examines and seeks to explain the contradictions between a growing awareness of the risks of climate-induced flooding in resilience plans and the continuation of development practices widely acknowledged to exacerbate those risks. It analyzes these contradictions in the context of Mumbai and Kolkata, India's largest coastal cities, which are facing the severest threats from climate-induced flooding. Based on analyses of key resilience planning documents and both planned and unplanned developments in some of Mumbai's and Kolkata's most ecologically sensitive areas, our analysis reveals that resilience planning, promoted by the central government and international consultants, and presented in locally produced 'fantasy plans', fails to address the risks of climate-change-related flooding owing to tendencies to sidestep questions of politics, power and the distributional conflicts that shape urban development. We conclude that efforts to reduce urban flood risk would benefit from the research, methods and analytic concepts used to critically study cities, but significant gaps remain between these fields.

Tailoring WRF and Noah-MP to Improve Process Representation of Sierra Nevada Runoff: Diagnostic Evaluation and Applications	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						regional climate models; runoff; California; Sierra Nevada; snowpack	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGY; CALIBRATION; RAINFALL; TRENDS; FLOW	Watersheds at the western margin of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California are regulated by large dams providing crucial water supply, flood control, and electricity generation. Runoff in these basins is snowmelt dominated and therefore vulnerable to alteration due to climate change. Regional climate models coupled to land surface models can be used to study the hydrologic impacts of climate change, but there is little evidence that they accurately simulate watershed-scale runoff in complex terrain. This study evaluates capabilities of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, coupled to the Noah-multiparameterization (MP) land surface model, to simulate runoff into nine Sierra Nevada reservoirs over the period 2007-2017. Default parameterizations lead to substantial inaccuracy in results, including median bias of 61%. Errors can be traced to process representations; specifically, we modify the representation of snowflake formation in the Thompson microphysics scheme and subsurface runoff generation in the Noah-MP land surface model, including a correction representing effects of groundwater storage. The resulting parameterization improves Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency to above 0.7 across all basins and reduces median bias to 21%. To assess capabilities of the modified WRF/Noah-MP system in supporting analysis of human-altered hydrology, we use its streamflow projections to force a reservoir operations model, results of which maintain high accuracy in predicting reservoir storage and releases (mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.41). This diagnostic analysis indicates that coupled climate and land surface models can be used to study climate change effects on reservoir systems in mountain regions via dynamical downscaling, when adequate physical parameterizations are used. Plain Language Summary In California, reservoirs are a critical component of hydroelectric power generation and flood control, in addition to storing water used by farms and cities. Much of the water that flows into the reservoirs comes as snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada mountains each spring. Wintertime snow accumulation and springtime snowmelt are likely to be impacted by rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns. However, little research has addressed whether regional climate models (RCMs) can accurately simulate runoff for California's reservoirs. Here we make multiple changes to a commonly used RCM, including improvements to how water is processed in the soil and how groundwater is represented. These changes improve the modeled runoff estimates when compared to values based on observations. We use 11 years of modeled runoff to drive a reservoir operations model. Though the modeled water system behavior using RCM runoff is not as realistic as a version of the model using observed runoff, the results predict many of the same variations in reservoir storage. The combined RCM and reservoir operations model can be used to project how reservoir inflows and storage may be impacted by future climate change.

Comparing Generic and Case Study Damage Functions: London Storm-Surge Example	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD; UNIVERSALITY; ADAPTATION	Two different approaches are used to assess the impacts associated with natural hazards and climate change in cities. A bottom-up approach uses high resolution data on constituent assets within the urban area. In contrast, a top-down approach uses less detailed information but is consequently more readily transferable. Here, we compare damage curves generated by each approach for coastal flooding in London. To compare them, we fit a log-logistic regression with three parameters to the calculated damage curves. We find that the functions are remarkably similar in their shape, albeit with different inflection points and a maximum damage that differs by 13%-25%. If rescaled, the curves agree almost exactly, which enables damage assessment to be undertaken following the calculation of the three parameters.

Climate change is expected to reinforce this trend, as mean weather parameters change, and the frequency and intensity of extreme events increases. This paper summarizes interrelationships of weather and transport for different transport modes from both supply and demand side perspectives on the basis of a literature review. To further explore the complexity of these interrelationships, it also evaluates news items (n = 839) in a sample of global media news outlets covering the world and population-dense world regions. Results confirm that extreme events have become disruptive of transport systems at the micro and macro scale, also affecting transport behavior. There are implications for environment, economy, technology, health, and society. Interrelationships are illustrated and discussed: Climatic impact drivers can be expected to increase transport vulnerabilities and risks, and have relevance for transport planning and adaptation.

This is particularly important in Southeast Queensland, Australia, which is projected to be significantly impacted by climate change. We have developed an integrated catchment modelling framework for the Nerang River catchment that combines a hydrologic model, a reservoir operation model, and a hydrodynamic river model. The multi-model ensemble is used to investigate eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) over the baseline period (2000-2009) and one future period (2075-2084). Additionally, the tidal section of the Lower Nerang River was studied under coupled impacts of the RCP scenarios and sea level rise by 0.80 m. The ensemble projections over the future period present slight decreasing tendencies in the median of monthly long-term daily inflow to Hinze Dam in the upper Nerang River. Additionally, the average environmental releases of 7.25 ML/day are expected to reduce over the future period by 6.02% and 5.37% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively compared to the baseline period. The hydrodynamic model results revealed that sea level rise is projected to have significant impact on water level variations at two river flooding alert sites, Carrara Alert and Evandale Alert. As a result, a 0.80 m sea level rise can increase ensemble water level projections by almost 0.75 m and 0.80 m at Carrara Alert and Evandale Alert sites, respectively, which will cause minor to major flooding events at Evandale Alert site. The outcomes of the present paper can assist the decision-makers and the community of the Nerang River catchment with a robust tool to evaluate climate change scenarios for sustainable future water resources management and allocation.

With a paucity of climate-based and geospatial observational studies in South Asia, this paper (i) links power sectors and carbon dioxide emissions, (ii) maps nitrogen dioxide density across three countries (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh), (iii) understands electricity generation trends and projects weather changes through 2100. We monitored data monitored between 1995 and 2021. The following databases were used: the International Energy Agency, the World Bank, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. Raw data was obtained for climate indicators, which were entered into Microsoft Excel. Geospatial trends were generated in the ArcGIS geostatistical tool by adopting the ordinary kriging method to interpolate and create continuous surfaces depicting the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the three countries. We found increased usage of coal and fossil fuels in three countries (Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh). Both were significant contributors to carbon dioxide emissions. The geographic localities in South Asia were densely clouded with nitrogen dioxide as reported with the tropospheric column mapping. There are expected to be increased days with a heat index >35 degrees C, and consecutive dry days from 2020 and 2100. We also found increased chances of flooding in certain regions across the three countries. This study monitored climate change indicators and projects between 1995 and 2100. Lastly, we make recommendations to improve the relationship of the environment and living beings.

Estuarine Hypoxia-Identifying High Risk Catchments Now and Under Future Climate Scenarios	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						blackwater; estuary; floodplain; fish kill; climate change; hypoxia	MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; WATER-QUALITY; BLACKWATER EVENTS; FISH-KILL; RIVER SYSTEMS; NORTHERN NSW; LEAF-LITTER; FLOODPLAIN; OXYGEN; DEOXYGENATION	Hypoxic blackwater events occur worldwide, affecting inland and coastal waters. These events have been exacerbated by man-made floodplain drainage, leading to large-scale fish kills and ecological degradation. This paper presents a new method to identify estuarine catchment areas that are most likely to generate hypoxic conditions. The method uses established risk factors, including vegetation type, inundation extent and duration, ground-truthed in eastern Australia. A catchment is at higher risk of hypoxic blackwater generation if (a) it is located where floodwaters are high and/or drainage is impeded, (b) the site topography includes an extensive, low-lying floodplain; and/or (c) the land-use and environmental characteristics have a high deoxygenation potential. Consequent impacts to an estuary are determined by the floodplain connectivity with the estuary, and the discharge characteristics of the catchment drainage system. Where multiple, proximate catchments have similar drainage conditions, compounding plumes of hypoxic blackwater can overwhelm the assimilation capacity of the estuary. Climate change may significantly increase the volume and frequency of blackwater events in estuarine environments as a result of reduced drainage due to sea level rise, higher temperatures, and more intense and sporadic rainfall events. It is recommended that management measures be introduced to mitigate the effects of climate change and avoid further widespread hypoxic blackwater events.

Drivers of future streamflow changes in watersheds across the Northeastern United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						streamflow; regional climate model; machine learning; snowmelt; random forest; climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEW-ENGLAND; FLOOD RISK; PRECIPITATION; PROJECTIONS; TRENDS; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; SIMULATION; CONVECTION	Accurate projections of streamflow, which have implications for flooding, water resources, hydropower, and ecosystems, are critical to climate change adaptation and require an understanding of streamflow sensitivity to climate drivers. The northeastern United States has experienced a dramatic increase in extreme precipitation over the past 25 years; however, the effects of these changes, as well as changes in other drivers of streamflow, remain unclear. Here, we use a random forest model forced with a regional climate model to examine historical and future streamflow dynamics of four watersheds across the Northeast. We find that streamflow in the cold season (November-May) is primarily driven by 3-day rainfall and antecedent wetness (Antecedent Precipitation Index) in three rainfall-dominant watersheds, and 30-day rainfall, antecedent wetness, and 30-day snowmelt in the fourth, more snowmelt-dominated watershed. In the warm season (June-October), streamflow is driven by antecedent wetness and rainfall in all watersheds. By the end of the century (2070-2099), cold season streamflow depends on the importance placed on snow in the machine learning model, with changes ranging from -7% (with snow) to +40% (without snow) in a single watershed. Simulated future warm season streamflow increases in two watersheds (56% and 193%) due to increased precipitation and antecedent soil wetness, but decreases in the other two watersheds (-6% and -27%) due to reduced precipitation.

This is particularly true for low-lying coastal areas, where climate-induced change is altering long-standing public policies associated with coastal development. In the US, attempts to address the new reality of climate change from a programmatic standpoint are generally referred to as resiliency planning. This article explores the concept of resiliency planning from a cost-orientated approach, viewing low-lying coastal property as areas of evolving risk. From this viewpoint, we develop a value transfer framework proposal that attempts to identify and quantify existing coastal asset values and engage in a transfer of the value to less risky inland areas that have been identified as economic development priority areas. The goal is to provide a risk-based, "cost center" approach to land use and related policymaking in risky coastal areas. This proposal attempts to highlight an example of a hazard-based policy intervention that maximizes opportunities to reduce coastal hazard risk, optimizes the social and economic utility of existing coastal investment through a transfer of development rights approach that is designed to build and enhance coastal resiliency. Future work can improve and build upon the principles set forth in the following framework proposal.

These changes, coupled with extreme rainfalls and inadequate flood channelling infrastructure, lead to urban flooding. The urban transport sector is at constant risk from urban flooding, and it should adapt to these climate change effects. This study focuses on developing an indicator-based approach called composite adaptability index (CAI) to assess the urban transportation system's adaptability to urban flooding based on exposure, susceptibility, and resilience. The weights of the indicators are estimated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the consistency tests are conducted to assess the efficiency of the weights. The index is tested on three adaptation policy bundles designed to improve the urban transportation system's resiliency compared to the Business as usual scenario for the years 2030 and 2050 in Bangalore, India. Testing of CAI showed that all the adaptation bundles showed increased adaptability. Overall, bundle 1 gave the best CAI results with 0.662 and 0.660 for 2030 and 2050, respectively and a 2% gain from the BAU scenario.

Addressing the challenges of climate change risks and adaptation in coastal areas: A review	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Climate change; Coastal engineering; Risk; Non-stationarity; Uncertainty; Adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; WAVE CLIMATE; FLOOD-RISK; BEACH; CONSEQUENCES; PROJECTIONS; FRAMEWORK; SCENARIOS; EROSION; PROTECTION	Climate change is and will continue altering the world's coasts, which are the most densely populated and economically active areas on earth and home for highly valuable ecosystems. While there is considerable relevant research, in the authors' experience this problem remains challenging for coastal engineering. This paper reviews important challenges in this respect and identifies three key actions to address them: (a) refocusing traditional practice towards more climate-aware approaches; (b) developing more comprehensive risk frameworks that include the multi-dimensionality and non-stationarity of their components and consideration of uncertainty; and (c) building bridges between risk assessment and adaptation theory and practice. We conclude that the way forward includes numerous activities including increased observations; the attribution of coastal impacts to their drivers; enhanced climate projections and their integration into impact models; more impact assessments at the local scale; dynamic projections of spatially-distributed exposure and vulnerability; and the exploration of inherently adaptive options. Given the complexity of the possible solutions, more practical guidance is required.

However, observed and potential non-stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under-design. Despite substantial attention, evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change. Practical guidance remains elusive. This paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non-stationarity. First, potential sources of non-stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation. Second, methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed. Third, methods for estimating design floods that assume non-stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized. Finally, the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented.

Using mechanistic insights to predict the climate-induced expansion of a key aquatic predator	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						biotic multipliers; climate change; ecological prediction; mechanistic models; predator-prey; species interactions; temporary ponds	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; AMBYSTOMA-OPACUM; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TEMPERATURE; LAKES; ICE; PRECIPITATION; COMMUNITIES; WINTERKILL	Ameliorating the impacts of climate change on communities requires understanding the mechanisms of change and applying them to predict future responses. One way to prioritize efforts is to identify biotic multipliers, which are species that are sensitive to climate change and disproportionately alter communities. We first evaluate the mechanisms underlying the occupancy dynamics of marbled salamanders, a key predator in temporary ponds in the eastern United States We use long-term data to evaluate four mechanistic hypotheses proposed to explain occupancy patterns, including autumn flooding, overwintering predation, freezing, and winterkill from oxygen depletion. Results suggest that winterkill and fall flooding best explain marbled salamander occupancy patterns. A field introduction experiment supports the importance of winterkill via hypoxia rather than freezing in determining overwinter survival and rejects dispersal limitation as a mechanism preventing establishment. We build climate-based correlative models that describe salamander occupancy across ponds and years at two latitudinally divergent sites, a southern and middle site, with and without field-collected habitat characteristics. Correlative models with climate and habitat variation described occupancy patterns better than climate-only models for each site, but poorly predicted occupancy patterns at the site not used for model development. We next built hybrid mechanistic metapopulation occupancy models that incorporated flooding and winterkill mechanisms. Although hybrid models did not describe observed site-specific occupancy dynamics better than correlative models, they better predicted the other site's dynamics, revealing a performance trade-off between model types. Under future climate scenarios, models predict an increased occupancy of marbled salamanders, especially at the middle site, and expansion at a northern site beyond the northern range boundary. Evidence for the climate sensitivity of marbled salamanders combined with their disproportionate ecological impacts suggests that they might act as biotic multipliers of climate change in temporary ponds. More generally, we predict that top aquatic vertebrate predators will expand into temperate-boreal lakes as climate change reduces winterkill worldwide. Predaceous species with life histories sensitive to winter temperatures provide good candidates for identifying additional biotic multipliers. Building models that include biological mechanisms for key species such as biotic multipliers could better predict broad changes in communities and design effective conservation actions.

How individuals and populations cope with extreme climatic events will influence their capacity to adapt and persist. Here, we analyzed how drought impacted eastern grey kangaroo populations by focusing on their body condition, demography, activity rates at water points, and the likelihood of parasitic infections. We found that body condition was lower as environmental conditions became more extreme and that fewer males in the population were observed. The proportion of juveniles within the population increased as more favorable conditions returned. Kangaroos with poor body conditions were more likely to become hosts to ticks, while higher parasite egg burdens in scats occurred in autumn. Our study has shown that the impacts eastern grey kangaroos face during climatic events such as drought can be severe and may have long-term consequences. Extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods are expected to become more intense and severe under climate change, especially in the southern and eastern parts of Australia. We aimed to quantify the relationship between body condition scores (BCS), demography, activity rate, and parasitic infections of eastern grey kangaroos on a large conservation property under different climate extremes by employing camera traps established at artificial water points (AWPs). The survey period included a severe drought, broken by a significant flooding event. Climatic and environmental conditions were documented using remotely sensed indices of moisture availability and vegetation productivity. These conditions were found to affect all health and population parameters measured. BCS, juvenile proportions, and sex ratios were most correlated with 6-month lags in climatic conditions, while the activity rate of kangaroos at AWPs was most correlated with vegetation productivity. Ticks were mostly found on individuals with a poorer BCS, while the concentration of parasitic eggs in feces was higher in autumn than in spring. Our study offers a glimpse into some of the environmental drivers of eastern grey kangaroo populations and their health, information that may become increasingly important in today's climate. It further emphasizes the importance of this knowledge for wildlife conservation efforts appropriate to managing the impact of climate change alongside other threats.

This highlights the communications associated with reactive oxygen species scavenging, molecular chaperones, and phytohormone signals among subcellular compartments. Given the complexity of climate change and the limitations of plants in coping with multiple abiotic stresses, a generic response to environmental constraints is proposed between calcium and abscisic acid signals in subcellular organelles.

The average annual runoff was found to be continuously increasing by the end of 21st century. The increase in precipitation as well as the streamflow for summer and winter in the NUIB indicated that RegCM4.3 simulated climate change projections were realistically transferred to HEC-HMS hydrological model. Maximum streamflow peaks, both in frequency and magnitude, were observed in July and August over three streamflow gauges (i.e. Besham, Nowshera and Khairabad) posing possible threats of flood risks during the monsoon season in Pakistan. Significant streamflow changes were projected for winter and spring seasons. The analysis of flow duration curve for three hydrometric stations indicates that the flow occurrence probability could be greater under both scenarios relative to the reference period. The increase in streamflow was projected under high (Q(5)) and medium (Q(50)) flow, which could possibly be related with the increase in monsoon precipitation events in the NUIB. Overall it is to be expected that the NUIB will confront more floods as a result of projected increase in medium and high flow, which demands better policies and management towards the water resources of the NUIB. This study is expected to contribute considerably to climate change impact assessment studies over the NUIB, Pakistan.

Estimating jaguar population size is difficult, due to uncertainty in the underlying dynamical processes as well as highly variable and sparse data. We develop a stochastic temporal model of jaguar abundance in the Peruvian Amazon, taking into account prey availability, under various climate change scenarios. The model is calibrated against existing data sets and an elicitation study in Pacaya Samiria. In order to account for uncertainty and variability, we construct a population of models over four key parameters, namely three scaling parameters for aquatic, small land, and large land animals and a hunting index. We then use this population of models to construct probabilistic evaluations of jaguar populations under various climate change scenarios characterized by increasingly severe flood and drought events and discuss the implications on jaguar numbers. Results imply that jaguar populations exhibit some robustness to extreme drought and flood, but that repeated exposure to these events over short periods can result in rapid decline. However, jaguar numbers could return to stability-albeit at lower numbers-if there are periods of benign climate patterns and other relevant factors are conducive.

J	Hassan, BT; Yassine, M; Amin, D				Hassan, Bassma Taher; Yassine, Mohamad; Amin, Doaa			Comparison of Urbanization, Climate Change, and Drainage Design Impacts on Urban Flashfloods in an Arid Region: Case Study, New Cairo, Egypt	WATER			English	Article						drainage network; GCMs; land use changes; RCP; surface runoff	RUNOFF; SYSTEM	Urban flooding is considered one of the hazardous disasters in metropolitan areas, especially for those located in arid regions. Due to the associated risks of climate change in increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events, climate-induced migration to urban areas leads to the intensification of urban settlements in arid regions as well as an increase in urban expansion towards arid land outskirts. This not only stresses the available infrastructure but also produces substantial social instability due to unplanned urban growth. Therefore, this study sheds light on the main factors that are increasing the flood risk, through examining the consequences of rapid urban growth and the performance of drainage networks on urban flood volumes and comparing it with the effects induced by climate change on the surface runoff. The effect of urbanization is assessed through land use maps showing the historical urbanization conditions for the past 30 years, while considering the role of urban planning and its effect on exacerbating surface runoff. Six climate projection scenarios adopted from three Global Climate Models under two Representative Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5) during the period (2006-2020) were compared to ground observed rainfall data to identify which climate scenario we are likely following and then evaluate its effects on the current rainfall trends up to the year 2050. The significance of the drainage design in the mitigation or increase of surface runoff is evaluated through capacity-load balance during regular and extreme storms. It is found that using impervious surfaces coupled with poor planning causing the blockage of natural flood plains led to an increase in the total runoff of about 180%, which is three times more than the effect induced by climate change for the same analysis period. Climate change decreased the intensities of 2- and 5-year rainfall events by 6% while increasing the intensities of extreme events corresponds to 100-year by 17%. Finally, the urban drainage had a distinguished role in increasing surface runoff, as 70% of the network performed poorly during the smallest rainfall event of 2-year return period. The study emphasizes the urgency to re-evaluate the existing and future urban drainage design approach: although urban development and climate change have inevitable effects on the increase in urban flood volumes, it could be alleviated through improved infrastructures.

This study examined the ability of communities to cope with food insecurity due to the changing climate in the Serere and Buyende districts, which are two different agro-ecological zones of Uganda. We administered 806 questionnaires to households, a sample size which was determined using Yamane's formula, with the snowball sampling method used to select the households. The questionnaire sought information, including that regarding the respondents' resources, the effects of climate change on households, and the coping mechanisms employed to reduce the impact of climate change on food security. The data collected was coded and analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). Agriculture was found to be the main source of income for 42.4% of male adults and 41.2% of female adults in Serere. In Buyende, 39.9% of males and 33.7% of females rely on selling animal, poultry, and food crops. Aggregate results further showed that 58.3% of females and 42.2% of the males from both districts had suffered from the impacts of climate change, and that the effects were more evident between March and May, when communities experienced crop failure. The study further found that the percentage of households who had three meals a day was reduced from 59.7% to 43.6%, while the number of households with no major meals a day increased from 1.3% to 1.6%. We also found that 34.3% of households reported buying food during periods of crop failure or food scarcity. Moreover, despite reporting an understanding of several coping mechanisms, many households were limited in their ability to implement the coping mechanisms by their low incomes. This reinforced their reliance on affordable mechanisms, such as growing drought-resistant crops (32.7%), rearing drought-resistant livestock breeds (26.1%), and reducing the number of meals a day (14.5%), which are mechanisms that are insufficient for solving all the climate-related food insecurity challenges. We recommend that the government intervenes by revising policies which help farmers cope with the negative effects of climate change, promoting the sensitization of farmers to employing the coping mechanisms, and subsidizing agricultural inputs, such as resistant varieties of crops, for all to afford.

Real options analysis (ROA) is a robust decision-making tool that allows for the incorporation of both uncertainty and new information. In this opinion article, we argue that ROA is a valuable tool, providing the analysis is designed to reflect the real-world characteristics of the decision context. We highlight the differences between traditional risk-based ROA, and scenario-based ROA, and discuss the relative merits of the approaches from the perspective of their assumptions and use of climate information. We also emphasize the need for increased co-development of ROA design and applications with end-users. Given the large climate uncertainties for long-term adaptation planning, we suggest that an emerging strand of scenario-based ROA methods offers ways to help identify and conditionally value flexibility without aggregating values into precise expected values across states of the world.

The Tracer Aided Catchment-Distributed (TAC d ) model is used to assess the present and future status of snowfall, snowmelt contribution and streamflow changes using the observed and projected climate data from an ensemble of 8 global climate models under various Representation Concentration Pathways (RCPs), viz. RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Snow precipitation presently comprises 52% of the total annual precipitation and contributes similar to 55% to the annual streamflow with the peak observed in May in the Lidder River. However, projections to the end of twenty-first century under various RCPs indicate that there shall be considerable decrease in both the snow precipitation and snowmelt contribution to the streamflow Moreover, early snowmelt is predicted during spring by the end of the twenty-first century under climate change, which leads to the shifting of streamflow peak from the late spring to early spring in the upstream and from summer to spring in the downstream areas of the basin. The observed streamflow shows a noticeable shift in the streamflow peak after 1990s and is more prominent in the downstream areas of the basin. The projected future climate change, snowfall depletion and streamflow changes are expected to significantly impact the timely availability of waters for various uses, flood vulnerability and sharing of the Indus waters.

Primary household surveys (528 households in sevenmouzas) are carried out to procure data on indicators of socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, health, food, water, social networks, natural disaster and climatic fluctuations. The data then have been processed by indices like livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and livelihood vulnerability index-intergovernmental panel on climate change (LVI-IPCC) to evaluate and compare vulnerabilities ofmouzascurrently suffering from physical processes like coastal erosion, embankment breaching and flood events. The research outcome implies that Baliara and Iswaripurmouzasare highly vulnerable (LVI score > 0.600 and LVI-IPCC score > 0.170); Narayanpur, Mousuni, Kusumtalamouzasare moderately vulnerable (LVI score 0.540-0.600 and LVI-IPCC score 0.060-0.170); and Bagdanga, Patibaniamouzasare least vulnerable (LVI score > 0.540 and LVI-IPCC score < 0.060) to changing climate phenomena. The foremost reasons behind higher vulnerability are greater exposure to climatic fluctuation, natural hazards and higher sensitivity to improper access to food, health, water and finally lower adaptive capacity in terms of poor socio-demographic profile and livelihood security. Findings of the study provide a deeper understanding of people's perception, adaptation and their ever-increasing vulnerability to changing climate. This approach based on indicators emphasizes sectors that necessitate particular intercession to design management plans for threatened communities. Such type of pragmatic approach of study formulates reliable methodology to quantify vulnerability and develop disaster management strategies to increase the resilience of vulnerable coastal people to climate change.

A downscaling-disaggregation approach for developing IDF curves in arid regions	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Lars WG; CMIP5; K-NN technique	WEATHER GENERATOR; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; FLOODS; IMPACT	Over the past decades, urbanization in Arabian Gulf region expands in flood-prone areas at an unprecedented rate. Chronic water stress and potential changes in extreme rainfall attributed to climate change therefore pose unique challenges in planning and designing water management infrastructures. The objective of this study is to develop a framework to integrate climate change variations into intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves in Oman. A two-stage downscaling-disaggregation method was applied with rainfall at Tawi-Atair station in Dhofar region. Potential variations of extreme rainfall in future were examined by eight scenarios composed with two general circulation models (GCMs), two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and two future periods (2040-2059 and 2080-2099). A stochastic weather generator model was used to downscale rainfall output from GCM grid scale to local scale. Downscaled daily data were then disaggregated to hourly and 5-min series by using K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) technique. Annual maximum rainfall extracted from eight future scenarios and also from present climate (baseline period) was used to develop rainfall intensity-frequency relationships for eight durations range from 5min to 24h. Results of the K-NN analysis indicate that the optimum window size of 57days and 181h is suitable for hourly and 5-min disaggregation models, respectively. Results also predict that the effects of climate change on the rainfall intensity will be more significant on storms with shorter durations and higher return periods. Moving towards the end of the twenty-first century, the return period of extreme rainfall events is likely to decrease due to intensified rainfall events.

Commonly used urban design storms, such as the Chicago (K-C) storm and Pilgrim and Cordery (P-C) storm, are calculated using prescribed or historical hyetographs. A prescribed hyetograph is unsuitable for a particular urban region in most cases, and a historical hyetograph takes no account of the spatiotemporal variations between the rainfall pattern at the rain station and that within the calculated region. Additionally, neither method can make adaptive adjustments for climate change. To obtain a more practical design storm with consideration of spatiotemporal variations and climatic changes, this study introduced proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to urban design storm study. To demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed methodology, four cities (London, New York, Sydney, Wuhan) in different continents with different climatic characteristics were selected as case studies. The principal results are as follows. (1) Breaking the assumption of a uniform precipitation distribution, the proposed DMD-POD method is effective in capturing design storms under current climatic conditions and is sufficiently flexible to adapt to climate change. (2) The low-order representation of the rainfall field indicates substantial change in the storm patterns in urban areas. The peak discharge in New York and Wuhan is almost 10% higher than before urbanization, while that in Sydney and London is more than 10% lower on average. The peak time is largely unchanged in New York and Sydney, while it is 4 and 5 h later in London and Wuhan, respectively. (3) Compared with the K-C storm and P-C storm, the flood peak of POD storm increases and appears slightly earlier. The flood peak time in Wuhan simulated with the POD storm is 1 h (2 h) earlier than that simulated with the K-C storm (P-C storm). The peak flow obtained by the POD storm is 9.55% (25.05%) greater than that obtained by the K-C storm (P-C storm), which means that the POD design storm demands a higher level of safety for an engineering project under the same return period.

Unplanned expansion of cities and the impacts of climate change increase risks and pose challenges to sustainable development. Urban flooding is a hazard that is attributed to an increase in built-up area and extreme weather events. Despite this, little has been done to understand the impact of urbanization and climate change, particularly in the big cities of Africa. This research integrated GIS, remote sensing, and statistical analysis to study past and future urban development patterns, rainfall trends, and their impact on urban flooding risk in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Future urbanization scenarios were developed using an integrated artificial neural network-Markov model in the IDRISI Selva 17.0 software, while a soil conservation service-curve number model and a Mann-Kendell test were employed to study direct runoff and trends in precipitation. The methodology and workflow were designed to address limitations of conducting empirical study, especially for developing countries, caused by the lack of detailed data on past and present conditions like land-use maps, networks of meteorological stations, and soil-related datasets such as soil texture and moisture. The results indicate that rapid urbanization is the major cause of flooding in Addis Ababa, spiking from 80.1 km(2) in 1984 to 287.9 km(2) in 2020 and expected to increase to 367.1 km(2) in 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. The fast urbanization has increased the number of flooding susceptible woredas (smallest administrative units) to a direct runoff depth of 25 mm from 40 in 1984 to 81 in 2020. On the other hand, no statistically significant increase has been found in the city's precipitation trend from 1976 to 2015. Furthermore, the flooding risk is likely to increase given the historical pattern of urban expansion and its current speed, as the number of flooding susceptible woredas increase to 90 in 2030 under the business-as-usual scenario. Thus, smart growth management on urban expansion and dense inner-city development are recommended to reduce the flooding risk.

Assessing farmers' preparedness to cope with the impacts of multiple climate change-related hazards in the Terai lowlands of Nepal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster preparedness; Extreme weather events; Protection motivation theory; Risk perception; Structural equation model	DIRE-DAWA TOWN; RISK PERCEPTION; DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; PEOPLES PERCEPTIONS; FLOOD PREPAREDNESS; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHANGE MITIGATION; ADAPTATION; EXPERIENCE; DETERMINANTS	Climate change-related natural hazards severely affect farmers' livelihoods. This study explores how farmers in the vulnerable western lowlands of Nepal are affected by floods, heatwaves, and cold spells, how they adapt, and the factors influencing their risk perception and intended adaptation behaviour. Data were collected through a survey of 350 randomly selected farming households from the Banke and Bardiya districts in the Tarai region. Farmers identified environmental risks as the most severe risks to their agricultural production, and their main adaptation strategies, including changes to planting dates and crop varieties and increasing the use of fertilisers and pesticides. Following protection motivation theory and using structural equation modelling, we found that farmers' risk perception and adaptation behaviour in response to three specific hazards (floods, heatwaves, and cold spells). The flood impact model showed that self-efficacy, perceived responsibility, response cost, trust, and concern partially influenced flood risk perception. These, in turn, mediated affected farmers' intended flood adaptation strategies. Flood damage experience thoroughly explained flood adaptation behaviour and was mediated by flood risk perception. Risk perception of flood has the significant mediation effects in the flood model, but heatwave and cold spell risk perception did not have any mediation effect in neither the heatwave nor the cold spells models. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that slow and rapid onset hazards are perceived differently. These problems were compounded by farmers also lacking both awareness and the requisite knowledge of how to deal with the impacts of the climate change related slow-onset hazards that will become more frequent as climate change continues, unabated. These differences will need to be accommodated in sustainable was in community awareness and disaster management programs to increase adaptive and resilient community capacity for the future.

However, the rate at which AR-based precipitation intensifies with warming and whether this rate differs from non-AR events remains uncertain. This work uses multiple statistical models to estimate regional, extreme precipitation-temperature scaling rates in California for AR and non-AR events. Scaling rates are determined using cold-season daily and hourly precipitation, along with multiple temperature variables to assess robustness of the results. We find that regional scaling rates for ARs are consistently larger than non-ARs, especially for hourly event maxima (posterior median scale rates of 5.7% and 2.4% per & DEG;C for ARs and non-ARs, respectively). ARs remain near saturated (i.e., high relative humidity) and exhibit more lift and a stronger increase in specific humidity aloft with warming as compared to non-ARs, helping to explain the difference in precipitation-temperature scaling rates.

However, common approaches to estimating IDF curves need to be revised to account for non-stationarity from global climate change. This review synthesizes the current knowledge and on-going research regarding IDF curves under non-stationarity. In particular, this review briefly summarizes known and projected changes in extreme precipitation at the global scale, describes approaches for IDF curve estimation under non-stationarity (focusing on the covariate-based approach and including a brief overview of the specific challenges facing snow-dominated regions), addresses the topic of regionalization under non-stationarity (which has been overlooked in previous reviews), explores the challenges of design values and uncertainty in the context of non-stationarity, provides details on these topics in the context of the United States, and finishes by enumerating needed avenues of future research.

By building on such paradigms, it eventually delineates an integrated approach to identify a socially desirable river setting, under a climate changing reality. The key point addressed is that when residual Risk and Operation, Management and Replacement costs are considered to their full extent, even a basic economic analysis may suggest alternative river settings that can be more attractive, particularly if accompanied by suitable economic-administrative management measures. Emphasis is put on the deep uncertainty characterizing the whole decision problem and on the need for a drastic change of paradigm. The approach proposed can greatly improve current Flood Risk Management Plans responding to the European Flood Directive (Directive 2007/60/EC). It can also help to develop constructive dialogues with stakeholders, while enhancing the understanding of the problem. Although mainly intended to address a conceptual level, it also aims at providing an applicable method.

Impacted by climate change and sea level rise in recent years, certain neighborhoods in the Can Gio District have been facing the loss of their residential and arable lands, as well as undesired relocations. Together with riverbank and coastal erosion, this phenomenon has several negative impacts on the lives of people in residential areas and on their economic activities. This research uses a literature review and observation as the main methods to explore the experiences of sea level rise adaptive housing and thereby suggests certain solutions for the Can Gio District. The solutions include saving space for water, elevating floors, constructing with floating floors, and creating biological ditches and osmotic lines to help quickly drain flooded water.

This circumstance could get worse, taking into account climate change effects. The literature points out different adaptation measures to minimize the possible increasing effects caused by climate change. Among them is the improvement of the vulnerability of a transport network and Emergency Management Systems. The effective management of emergencies is of vital importance to minimize the potential damage resulting from a catastrophe. Given such circumstances, analysis of the vulnerability of networks is a technique whose results highlight deficiencies and serve as support for future decisions concerning the transformation of the network or the installation of new emergency centers. The main objective of this research is to highlight the vulnerability of the road network in a variety of multi-contingency scenarios related to flooding and to identify the optimal location for a new emergency management center based on that analysis. The results obtained could be used in urban planning tasks to improve the resilience of urban areas in the face of an increase in flood episodes caused by climate change.

Managing hygiene can be affected by several factors and situations such as natural disasters. Focusing on 'super flooding' in Pakistan's Sindh Province, we pay attention to how this 'natural disaster' has affected hygienic practices of menstrual cycle of women. The study meticulously examines the dynamics of menstrual hygiene management, encompassing the nuanced encounters with feelings of shame and embarrassment among girls and women situated in flood camps, schools, and community shelters. It also intends to highlight women's challenge and embarrassment to participate in the distribution process of essential resources such as pads. The insights garnered from this study hold potential relevance for various stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare practitioners, and researchers, offering a nuanced comprehension of the intersection of menstrual hygiene, climate change, and well-being of women.

In the context of flood insurance and disaster financing, charity hazard is particularly worrisome given current trends of increasing flood risks as a result of climate change and more people choosing to locate in high-risk areas. We conduct an experimental analysis of the influence on flood insurance demand of risk and ambiguity preferences and the availability of different forms of government compensation for disaster damage. Certain and risky government compensation crowd out demand, confirming charity hazard, but this is not observed for ambiguous compensation. Ambiguity averse subjects have higher insurance demand when government compensation is ambiguous relative to risky. Policy recommendations are discussed to overcome charity hazard.

Using endogenous switching regression (ESR) approach and household survey from Cambodian farmers, the study finds a low adoption rate (14%) of 3CRS. The low adoption of 3CRS means missing opportunities for rice farmers. Access to information through training and input suppliers is found to increase the adoption of 3CRS. The adoption of 3CRS increases rice yields and profits by 36% and 45%, respectively. Additionally, if nonadopters adopted 3CRS, rice yields and profits would increase by 55% and 52%, respectively. Findings suggest the development of institutional capacity, implementation, and dissemination of knowledge of climatic changes, and adaptation strategies to increase food security.

However, cultural landscapes are threatened by climate change because of the direct and indirect impacts it has on all types of cultural heritage resources. This research aims to investigate the efficacy of transdisciplinary and participatory planning approaches in augmenting the resilience of cultural landscapes in the face of climate change risks. This article presents a novel contribution by examining the recovery process of the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System (SHHS) through the lens of international principles aimed at mitigating natural hazards and fostering resilience. The methodology adopts a comprehensive approach that combines a systematic literature review with a detailed analysis of the recovery process of the SHHS during the 2019 flooding in Khuzestan Province, Iran. The research findings highlight the significance of employing a transdisciplinary and participatory planning approach to enhance climate resilience within cultural landscapes. The active involvement of the local community throughout the process of resilience strategy development and implementation emerges as a pivotal factor. Furthermore, the success of resilience strategies in cultural landscapes relies on key elements such as accurate identification and communication, capacity building, fostering trust, and ensuring sufficient funding.

J	Fang, HY; Fan, ZM				Fang, Haiyan; Fan, Zemeng			Impacts of climate and land use changes on water and sediment yields for the black soil region, northeastern China	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Climate and land use changes; Modeling; Water yield; Sediment yield; Black soil region	RIVER-BASIN; EROSION; CATCHMENT; HYDROLOGY; RUNOFF; PRODUCTIVITY; FLOODS; RATES; LOAD	The impact of climate or land use change on hydro-sedimentological process has been widely studied. However, their combined and distinct impacts to catchment runoff and sediment yield (SY) have received comparatively little attention, which impedes decision makers to better manage land use. To that end, the spatially distributed TETIS model was adopted to estimate impacts of land use and climate change on runoff and SY during 1978-2014 in the Yian catchment of the black soil region, northeastern China. Results indicated that the scenario with only climate change increased water and SYs by 31.55% and 92.1%, respectively. The scenarios with the changes in land use in 1985, 1995, 2000 and 2010 increased water and SYs by 1.28% and 12.54%, respectively. With respect to the baseline period in 1978-1987, the average increased rates of water and SYs were 31.7% and 114.5%, respectively. The contributions by climate change were 99.5% for water yield and 69.2% for SY, respectively. This study indicated that rational configuration and management of land use can alleviate the adverse impact derived by climate change in the black soil region and similar regions all over the world.

Therefore, the prediction of future precipitation and waterlogging is of utmost importance. Using Beijing as an example, the simulation capability of different models was evaluated, and the optimal model for the study area was screened using Taylor diagrams and interannual variability scores, along with actual monthly precipitation data from Chinese weather stations from 1994 to 2014 and historical monthly precipitation data from 10 coupled models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The SWMM model was then used to simulate future rainfall and waterlogging scenarios for the study area using precipitation forecast data for 2020-2050 from the best model to investigate the impact of climate change on future rainfall and waterlogging in urban areas. CMIP6 brings together the most recent simulation data from major climate models on a global scale, providing a broader and more diverse range of model results and thereby making future predictions more accurate and dependable, and its findings provide a theoretical foundation for the emergency management of and scientific responses to urban flooding events. The following major conclusions were reached: 1. The best-performing models are EC-Earth3, GFDL-ESM4, and MPI- ESM1-2-HR. EC-Earth3 is a modular Earth system model developed collaboratively by a European consortium. MPI-ESM1-2 is a climate precipitation prediction model developed in Germany and promoted for global application, whereas the GFDL-ESM4 model was developed in the United States and is currently employed for global climate precipitation simulations. 2. Under future climate circumstances, the total annual precipitation in the example region simulated by all three models increases by a maximum of 40%. 3. Under future climatic conditions, urban surface runoff and nodal overflow in the study area will be more significant. The node overflow will become more severe with the increase in climate scenario oppression, and the potential overflow nodes will account for 1.5%, 2.7%, and 2.9% of the total number of nodes under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. 4. In the future, the effectiveness of stormwater drainage systems may diminish. To increase climate change resilience, the impacts of climate change should be considered when planning the scope of stormwater optimization and the integrated improvement of gray-green-blue facilities.

J	Xu, ZR; Yang, YD; Sun, T				Xu, Zhengrong; Yang, Yuda; Sun, Tao			Feng Shui and Imperial Examinations: a case study on the 1849 severe flood in Nanjing and debates on flood discharge	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Extreme climatic events; China; Social adaptation; Concepts; Feng Shui	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Social adaptations to natural hazards in China were influenced by various social and economic factors including traditional cultures such as Feng Shui, also known as Chinese geomancy. This study examines not only the progressive processes and spatial distribution of the 1849 severe flood in Nanjing City but also subsequent countermeasures based on historical documents, maps, and digital elevation model (DEM) data. As an adaptation to extreme floods, a project that connects Xuanwu Lake to the Yangtze River was deeply debated to relieve the flood risk. Local elites and ordinary people of Nanjing City worried that the project may destroy the Feng Shui of the city, which may bring misfortune to local candidates in the Imperial Examinations, their future promotion, the prosperity of their families, and the development of the local society in the city. This indicates that, in the complicated traditional Chinese society, such traditional cultures may play an important role in determining social adaptations to climate change. However, these traditional cultural concepts may not lead to a consensus without specific institutional culture. Hence, in the complicated social background, the institutional culture was also fundamental to build social adaptations to climate change. The project that connects Xuanwu Lake to the Yangtze River was eventually completed in 1931, which shows that the cultural concepts are dynamic in a complicated traditional society and are continuously changed along with the influence of institutional changes, educational development, and the guidance of the media guidance.

Community business resilience: adaptation practice of micro- and small enterprises around the Pearl River Estuary	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Adaptation; Climate change; Social capital; Community business; Extreme weather; China	FLOOD-RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; PLACE; VULNERABILITY; TOURISM; DIMENSIONS; IDENTITY	Small community businesses bear the brunt of climate change impacts. Studies of the vulnerability and resilience of such businesses predominantly focus on firm-level characteristics and organizational issues. This paper addresses the lack of individual-level considerations. It explores an analytical approach that draws upon the concepts of social capital and sense of place for understanding community businesses' resilience to extreme weather. An empirical study was conducted to investigate whether and how the attributes of these concepts are related to adaptation practice. This study is based on a structured questionnaire survey of community businesses at various locations around the Pearl River Estuary that are exposed to storm surges. The findings partially support the hypothesis that action is more likely to be taken when social capital is strong. Community businesses are more likely to adopt adaptation strategies when their owners or operators perceive a higher level of social expectation, but are less likely to do so when they have better relationships with the people around them. This study indicated the potential for moral hazard driven by good social relationships and supported the understanding of small community businesses as firms and social agents in responding to climate change impacts. There is a need for recognizing the social dimensions of small businesses' rationality in their adaptation and hazard adjustment, and strengthening their engagement with community-based adaptation through social institutions.

Historical and projected changes in hydrological and sediment connectivity under climate change in a tropical catchment of Mexico	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Geomorphology; Erosion; Runoff; Land cover; Land use	LAND-USE; LANDSCAPE; IMPACT; INDEX; FLOW; TOPOGRAPHY; FRAMEWORK; TERRAIN; RUNOFF; DRIVEN	Hydrological and erosion dynamics are prone to change due to natural factors, human activities, or climate change. These changes are mainly related to modifications of land use and cover and can be assessed through the concept of connectivity, which analyzes how the spatial distribution of the elements facilitates runoff and sediment transport. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in hydrological and sediment connectivity over 42 years and prqjected under a climate change scenario in the tropical Santa Cruz catchment in Aquismcin, S.I,.P., Mexico. The index of connectivity (IC) was computed using SedinConnect version 2.3 and the ArcSWAT model to estimate runoff. Hydrological connectivity and runoff were projected for 2027 using the MPI ECIIAM 5 in the A2 climate change scenario. The results indicated that spatio-temporal changes in land use/cover, in conjunction with geomorphological features and expected climate change, would modify hydrological and sediment connectivity, especially in flat areas, where conversion of natural vegetation to cropland was steadily increasing over the years. Under future conditions, runoff and sediment transport are likely to increase, which will impact soil erosion and vulnerability to flooding but will not necessarily be negative. The study shows how spatial-temporal integration of runoff, sediments, landforms, land use cover and change, and connectivity can improve our understanding of catchment dynamics and the importance of analyses that characterize their evolution. The results can subsequently be applied and replicated in other catchments for management and restoration purposes.

The present study reviews observed and modelled changes in the climate, cryosphere and impacts related to hazards, agriculture and ecosystems. An increasing temperature trend over the IHR is reported, which over a few locations is found to be higher than the global average. For precipitation, a complex and inconsistent response with considerable variation in the sign and magnitude of change is observed. Future projections show significant warming. Climate-driven changes and impacts are clearly observed. Snow cover has declined since the 1960s, with an enhanced decreasing trend during the 1990s and variable trends since 2000. Glaciers are losing mass and retreating at varying rates since the early 20th century, with an exception over the Karakoram region. An observed heterogeneous response of glaciers to atmospheric warming is controlled by regional variations in topography, debris cover, circulation and precipitation. Initial assessments of permafrost extent of 1 million km(2) across the IHR roughly translate into 14 times the glacier area. Extreme floods represent the most frequent natural disaster in the IHR. Studies have highlighted the significant threat from glacial lakes. Landslides occur in combination with heavy rainfall and flooding, with poor land- use practices such as road-cutting and deforestation being additional drivers. Climate change has also stressed traditional subsistence agriculture and food systems. Improving systematic and coordinated monitoring of climate and related impacts is crucial to contribute to effective climate change adaptation and response strategies.yy	[Dimri, A.

J	Avashia, V; Garg, A				Avashia, Vidhee; Garg, Amit			Implications of land use transitions and climate change on local flooding in urban areas: An assessment of 42 Indian cities	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Land use change; Flooding; India; Urban; Climate change	MULTILEVEL HEDONIC ANALYSIS; CHANGE IMPACTS; RISK; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; ADAPTATION; CHALLENGES; INCREASE; EVENTS	Urban development induced land transitions affect urban hydrology, resulting in increased flooding risks. Climate change-related precipitation changes are an added complexity to the flood risks of cities. This study examines the role of land use changes in determining the occurrence of urban flooding events across 42 Indian cities under current and future climate change scenarios. Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017 have been processed using a hybrid classification technique to determine the land use shares for all cities. A typical event-count study using newspaper archives has been conducted to create a flooding event database. A multilevel model employing logistic mixed-effects approach was used. Future projections of the occurrence of flooding events for nine models under three climate change-related Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)-2.6, 4.5, and 8.5-and three urban development scenarios have been carried out. The results suggest that cities should preserve the land uses that act as a sponge-the green, open and blue spaces. As these spaces decrease, the projected flooding events increase. Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, the number of flooding events is significantly lower (95 % confidence) than under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. The expected flooding occurrences between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are not significantly different (95 % confidence) for many scenarios, suggesting that Indian cities should aim for a world temperature increase of below 2 degrees C, or devastating consequences are imminent. This study highlights the need for Indian cities to undertake integrated spatial planning measures for a resilient, sustainable urban future.

This change has affected the water resource management so that the amount of water entered from upstream of watersheds has been transformed every year, and the water resource management has become difficult for the surface runoff, entered water, flood and drought. The problem becomes more serious when the study area (Kan watershed) is located upstream of such urban watershed as Tehran, where the climate change studies on the water resources are very important. In this study, using the Statistical downscaling model (SDSM), the data of CanESM2 Canadian general circulation model (GCM) was downscaled under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. In order to study the climate change, the artificial neural network (ANN) and IHACRES models were used over the period of 2010-2040. The study results showed that the temperature is increased in the upcoming period of 2006-2100 (0.8-5.6 CS), and the highest temperature changes are related to winter and summer. The precipitation in the upcoming period shows an increasing trend on the annual average, but, in general, it can be said that the 4-55% precipitation shows an increasing trend. The runoff in the upcoming period of 2010-2040 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is -4, 26 and -2 percent in the ANN model and 26, 28 and 33 percent in the IHACRES model, respectively.

This study investigates the impacts of recent urban development on hydrological runoff and urban flood volumes in a major city located in northern China, and compares the urbanization impacts with the effects induced by climate change under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5).We then quantify the role of urban drainage system in mitigating flood volumes to inform future adaptation straiegies. A geospatial database on landuse types, surface imperviousness and drainage systems is developed and used as inputs into the SWMM urban drainage model to estimate the flood volumes and related risks under various urbanization and climate change scenarios. It is found that urbanization has led to an increase in annual surface runoff by 208 to 413%, but the changes in urban flood volumes can vary greatly depending on performance of drainage system along the development. Specifically, changes caused by urbanization in expected annual flood volumes are within a range of 194 to 942%, which are much higher than the effects induced by climate change under the RCP 2.6 scenario (64 to 200%). Through comparing the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and flood volumes, this study highlights the importance for re-assessment of current and future urban drainage in coping with the changing urban floods induced by local and large-scale changes.

For this purpose, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was calibrated and validated for the Talar River Basin in northern Iran. Four empirical approaches including the Sangal, Fill-Steiner, Fuller, and Slope-based methods were used to estimate the Instantaneous Peak Flow (IPF) on a daily basis. The calibrated SWAT model was run under the two RCP scenarios using a combination of twenty GCMs from CMIP5 for the near future (2020-2040). To assess the impact of climate change on flood frequency pattern and to quantify the contribution of each subbasin on the total discharge from the Talar River Basin, Flood Frequency Index (FFI) and Subbasin Flood Source Area Index (SFSAI) were used. Results revealed that the projected climate change will likely lead to an average discharge decrease in January, February, and March for both RCPs and an increase in September and October for RCP 8.5. The maximum and minimum temperature will likely increase for all months in the near future. The annual precipitation could increase by more than 20% in the near future. This is likely to lead to an increase of IPF. The results can help managers and policy makers to better define mitigation and adaptation strategies for basins in similar climates.

However, little is known about how such environmental changes might impact crocodylians inhabiting the Neotropics and the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs) for long-term species conservation. To fill this gap, we used the Yacare Caiman (Caiman yacare) as a model to explore how climate change and habitat degradation might affect its distribution by 2050 and the effectiveness of current PAs for species conservation in response to future environmental changes. To this end, we estimated C. yacare suitable habitat using an ensemble modeling and consensus approach and assessed the species distribution variation inside and outside PAs as a consequence of two greenhouse emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways [RCPs] 4.5 and 8.5), and three General Circulation Models (GCMs; ACCESS1-0, CANESM2, and MRI-CGCM3) for 2050. We estimated the current suitable habitat for C. yacare to be 854,494 km(2) divided across five countries: Brazil (396,476 km(2)), Bolivia (377,853 km(2)), Paraguay (38,288 km(2)), Argentina (35,423 km(2)), and Peru (6,451 km(2)). Of these countries, Peru is the only one that can be considered "potential" because the species has not been registered there yet. We found that currently only 26.8% (228,835 km(2)) of C. yacare suitable habitat is under any type of protection of the IUCN Protected Area Categories System, which is currently well preserved from habitat degradation with only 1.9% reduced due to deforestation. We predicted that on average 56.2% of the current species range might be lost because of climate change and habitat degradation and only 14.7% of its suitable range could be preserved based on the current PAs system. Based on our assessment, we showed that future climate change scenarios and habitat degradation processes will require the establishment of additional PAs as well as the implementation of sustainable management strategies emphasizing corridors and suitable habitat linkages. These integrative approaches can be implemented in several ecoregions including the Pantanal flooded savannas, Cerrado woodlands and savannas, Beni savanna, Chiquitano dry forests, and Amazon moist forests, which we predict will be relatively well-preserved under most of the future climate change scenarios and constituting as priority regions for the long-term conservation of the species and tropical biodiversity.

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm's way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth's energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.

J	Ren, PZ; Stewardson, M; Peel, M; Fowler, K				Ren, Peizhen; Stewardson, Michael; Peel, Murray; Fowler, Keirnan			A modified Gould-Dincer method to assess yield of carry-over reservoirs with environmental water requirements	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Gould-Dincer method; Environmental flow; Yield for human use; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOWS; RELIABILITY; RESILIENCE; STREAMFLOW; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY; SCIENCE; RUNOFF; MODELS	Protecting freshwater systems to ensure sustainability requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from local to global. There is growing acceptance that environmental flows must be protected to sustain river channels and floodplain ecosystems downstream of reservoirs. Meeting environmental water requirements has proven difficult because they reduce water yield available for human use - a particular challenge in regions already experiencing declining water availability with climate change. A further challenge is the difficulty of assessing the impact of environmental water requirements on water availability for other purposes. This paper provides a modification of the Gould-Dincer method to assess the yield of carry-over reservoirs subject to environmental water requirements. The method characterizes reservoir inflows using readily available flow characteristics (annual mean and Cv). We develop and test the method using ten examples with well-understood environmental water requirements and a range of annual flow Cv s. We then demonstrate this method at continental scale, to investigate the impact on yield of providing high-reliability supply including environmental water requirements, under a changing climate. According to our results, considering climate change and environmental flow provision simultaneously, the decline in water yield is projected to be about 27% and 18% respectively for Australia and US (based on hypothetical reservoirs capacity of one times mean annual inflow). Adapting environmental flow demands to future hydrological conditions results in a 2% and 3% increase in Australia and US-wide yield for human use respectively. While further testing is needed, the method provides a simple and rapid way to estimate the impact of providing environmental flow on yield, applicable at global scale.

Through the unique lens of successive disaster events (Hurricane Harvey and Winter Storm Uri) coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed disaster exposure in minority communities in Harris County, Texas. A mixed methods approach employing qualitative and quantitative designs was used to examine the relationships between successive disasters (and the role of climate change), population geography, race, and health disparities-related outcomes. This study identified four communities in the greater Houston area with predominantly non-Hispanic African American residents. We used data chronicling the local community and environment to build base maps and conducted spatial analyses using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping. We complemented these data with focus groups to assess participants' experiences in disaster planning and recovery, as well as community resilience. Thematic analysis was used to identify key patterns. Across all four communities, we observed significant Hurricane Harvey flooding and significantly greater exposure to 10 of the 11 COVID-19 risk factors examined, compared to the rest of the county. Spatial analyses reveal higher disease burden, greater social vulnerability, and significantly higher community-level risk factors for both pandemics and disaster events in the four communities, compared to all other communities in Harris County. Two themes emerged from thematic data analysis: (1) Prior disaster exposure prepared minority populations in Harris County to better handle subsequent disaster suggesting enhanced disaster resilience, and (2) social connectedness was key to disaster resiliency. Long-standing disparities make people of color at greater risk for social vulnerability. Addressing climate change offers the potential to alleviate these health disparities.

However, the performance and safety of dams depend on the hydrologic regime that is altering in a changing climate. This study assessed the impacts of climate change on water availability, regulation function, hydropower generation and flood hazards for major dams in the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB), under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios during the twenty-first century. First, the outputs of 14 global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for the medium (SSP245) and high (SSP585) emission scenarios were used to drive a coupled hydrological, dam and hydroelectric model. Then, changes in metrics covering dam inflow and service performance in the future relative to the historical period were quantified. Finally, climate change-induced flood hazards were investigated by extreme value analysis. Our results show that dam inflow in the basin will exhibit an overall increase in annual mean and more extremes in high and low flows. Meanwhile, hydropower generation will exhibit an increase in magnitude and interannual variability, with a marked rise in spilled water. The results also show the likelihood of experiencing a more extended high flow season, which will consequently impact the flood season with the increase in the frequency and magnitude of flood events, necessitating more prudent and optimal operating rules for the dams on the river system. Moreover, the regulation function of dams is expected to strengthen in the flood season and weaken in the dry season. These findings indicate the increasing importance of dams as a critical water infrastructure system and underline the need for existing operations in adaptation to future climate.

The eustatic sea-level is rising rapidly due to global warming, whereas storm surges are expected to become more frequent and intense, which necessitate the identification and protection of sensitive sections of coastline. This paper deals with the classification of the coasts of Zakynthos Island, located in the Ionian Sea, according to their sensitivity to both coastal erosion and flooding, caused by climate change-induced hazards, with the assessment of the Coastal Sensitivity Index (CSI). CSI allows six physical variables to be related in a quantifiable manner. The variables include geology-geomorphology, coastal slope, rate of long-term shoreline erosion or accretion, relative sea-level change rate, mean wave height and mean tidal range. The produced CSI map for the studied coastline indicates that nearly 14.1 km, (corresponding to 7.4% of the entire coastline of the island) is characterized as highly and very highly sensitive primarily due to the low regional coastal slope and the presence of highly erodible sandy and coble beaches. The coasts of high and very high CSI values host socio-economically important land uses (discontinuous urban areas, touristically developed beaches, sport and leisure facilities and agricultural activities). Furthermore, about 25% of the coastline of the Zakynthos Natura 2000 protected area is highly and very highly sensitive to climate change exacerbated coastal hazards.

The paper presents a probabilistic decision-making framework under hydroclimatic nonstationary assumptions to evaluate the robustness of the preselected plans and identify the optimal plan using a genetic algorithm approach. The framework incorporates a new metric for maximum allowable time to apply the adaptations and maintaining operational targets without penalties. The framework has four stages for climate exposure identification, production of water supply scenarios, generation of water demand scenarios, and evaluation of system performance. Hydrologic variables considered include precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. The Diyala River Basin in Iraq was used as a case study to test the effectiveness of the framework. Three synthetic preselected plans were developed by reducing the demand ratios of the system. Results indicate that current operational rules are robust for flood protection but vulnerable in drought periods. Precipitation changes were dominant in flood and drought management, and temperature and wind speed change effects were significant during drought. Results demonstrated the framework's effectiveness to quantify detrimental climate change effects, provide long-term guides for operational planning, and identify the upper limit of application time of the adaptation strategies in the system to avert the climate change impact. Framework application suggests an optimal adaptation strategy, robustness examination of the presuggested plans, and identification of the maximum allowable time for the robust plans.

This is witnessed in the increasing number of natural disasters and most notably in Asia and the Pacific (APAC), the region reported to be more afflicted than any other part of the world. Based on a multisource global data, we analyzed the trends, nature, and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC, including East and North-East Asia (ENEA), North and Central Asia (NCA), Southeast Asia (SEA), South and South-West Asia (SSWA), and the Pacific and Oceania (Pacific) between 1990 and 2018. The paper also described their implications on the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG13) -which calls on governments to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Analysis revealed upward trends of flood occurrences and impacts across the sub-regions of APAC. This not only poses a threat of undermining the economic growth and development attained over years as well as poverty eradication in APAC, especially in regions of ENEA, SEA and SSWA but also in curtailing the progress of achieving sustainable development by 2030. Fortunately, this study the first of its kind to explore the linkage between floods and SDGs strived to explain in particular, how SDG13 offers some of the salient mechanisms under its 5 targets to be leveraged in addressing and minimizing floods and their impacts in APAC. In turn, this contributes to the scientific knowledge for informing flood risk management in APAC and elsewhere.

Sustainable groundwater depends on many parameters: climate change is one factor, which leads to floods and droughts. Distribution of groundwater age indicates groundwater velocity, recharge rate and risk assessment. We developed transient 3D mathematical models, i.e., MODFLOW and MODPATH, to measure the distributions of groundwater age, impacted by climate change (IPSL-CM5A-MR), based on representative concentration pathways, defined in terms of atmospheric CO2 concentration, e.g., 2.6 to 8.5, for the periods 2020 to 2099. The distributions of groundwater age varied from 100 to 100,000 years, with the mean groundwater age similar to 11,000 years, generated by climate led change in recharge to and pumping from the groundwater. Interestingly, under increasing recharge scenarios, the mean age, in the groundwater age distribution, decreased slightly in the shallow aquifers, but increased in deep aquifers, indicating that the new water was in shallow aquifers. On the other hand, under decreasing recharge scenarios, groundwater age increased significantly, both shallow and deep aquifers, because the decrease in recharge caused longer residence times and lower velocity flows. However, the overall mean groundwater age gradually increased, because the groundwater mixed in both shallow and deep aquifers. Decreased recharge, in simulation, led to increased groundwater age; thus groundwater may become a nonrenewable groundwater. Nonrenewable groundwater should be carefully managed, because, if old groundwater is pumped, it cannot be restored, with a detriment to human life.

However, it is difficult to evaluate their tectonic or climatic origin without detailed chronology. In this study, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating was applied to fluvial/flood and aeolian sediments on five lowest fluvial terraces (49 m in total) along the Keriya River, and the 21 OSL ages (from 11 samples) revealed the incision processes since the mid-Holocene, especially the fast incision (3.5-0 ka, 10.9 mm/a) during the late Holocene. This was supported by the climatic background, i.e., increased precipitation from the westerlies and meltwater from frequent glacial advance-retreat events. As a response to the climatic changes, largescale floods were frequent as well, e.g., at 3.5, 2.6, 0.87, and 0.25 ka, which were crucial for the fast incisions on the filling gravels. Additionally, the flood also caused the river's further extension into the Talclamakan Desert and controlled the evolution of oases in the desert, including ancient cities and cultures. Consequently, we suggest that climatic change was important for the incision and formation of cut-in-fill terraces along the Keriya River during the Holocene, and influences from other factors, including surface uplift, should not be ignored, but were difficult to be evaluated.

Low lying deltas all over the world are increasingly subjected to multidimensional risk of sea level rise, cyclone, surges and salinisation. The life and livelihood of the communities of such deltas are endangered due to climate change acting as risk multiplier. The Mahanadi delta in the state of Odisha, India is one of the such populous deltas with estimated 8 million population in 2011 with a density of 613 persons/km(2). Over the past decades, it experienced major climatic threats in the form of cyclone, surge inundation and flooding with variable intensities and impacts along and across the coast. The present research assessed the risk of climatic extreme events and their variability in the delta, with an intention of mitigation or adaptation to possible impacts in specific region. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and daily rainfall data were used to extract flood inundation. Tropical Cyclone Risk Model (TCRM) along with surge decay function was used to estimate cyclonic wind speed and surge inundation and risk indices were computed using fuzzy logic based approach. The result shows that in the coastal districts, risk of severe cyclones rank above the heavy floods. Agriculture, the main livelihood of these districts (71%) is impacted adversely making the delta community vulnerable to such extreme events. Kendrapara followed by Bhadrak and Jagasinghpur districts appear to be most risk prone segment in the delta making the northern part comparatively more risk prone where focused mitigation and adaptation actions are needed.

Arid regions of the world need proper management for the water resources as climatic changes are bringing severe problems for their sustainability. Pothohar area of Pakistan is the most essential in this regard. A data set of 30 years of temperature, precipitation, and river discharge across the Pothohar Plateau were obtained from Pakistan Meteorological Department and Water and Power Development Authority, respectively. Hydro-meteorological data were subjected to a series of statistical methods for detecting trend and abrupt point changes. A rising trend in mean annual temperatures were noticed in all stations with most significant change in Jhelum and Attock stations (p < 0.05) during the period of 30 years while precipitation trends were found irregular, representing both scenarios of flash floods and droughts with non-significant change (p > 0.05). In addition, 2000 and 2001 are drought years in 30 years of time series, and the driest years were seen from 1999 to 2002. The discharge of River Haro and Soan were found downward significantly (p > 0.05), posing a threatening challenge to the future of water resources in this area. The correlation coefficient test revealed a substantial relationship between mean annual precipitation and river discharge, although the linear regression model demonstrated a diminishing trend with mean annual precipitation. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that modern techniques of irrigation and agriculture should be adopted to protect the future of the Pothohar area from climate change related extreme situations.

Evidence from analyses of households' climate hazard exposure and adaptation actors in SE Nigeria	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Remittances; Climate hazards; Climate financing; Adaptation actors; Households; Developing countries	INNOVATION	Migrant remittances are potentially significant sources of funding for climate change adaptation and resilience building in developing countries. However, very little is understood about the linkages between climate actions and remittances at the household level. It is not clear how remittances can affect households' responses to climate change. This paper presents evidence from analyses of the associations between remittances to households, their climate hazard exposure, and adaptation actors. It uses concurrent data on international remittances receipts, three climate change related hazards (flooding, intense and irregular rainfall), and main adaptation actors (self/family, community, government, and NGOs) from over 600 households in South Eastern Nigeria. The results showed that household incidence of remittances is low (15%) while exposure to climate hazards is higher (flooding: 41.2%, intense rainfall: 47.1%, irregular rainfall: 29.9%). Nominal (contingency coefficient) associations between remittances and household climate hazard exposure and remittances and household adaptation actors were mostly moderate and insignificant. Therefore, households that received remittances and those that did not were not significantly different in terms of their exposure to climate hazard and main actors in climate adaptation. Self/families were the main actors in household climate actions. Governments and NGO actors were less prominent. The results suggest that unregulated remittances have limited impact on household climate hazard exposure and adaptive actions. However, there are indications that the contribution of remittances to financing climate adaptation may be enhanced by addressing issues with cost of remitting and remittee understanding of climate change to increase remittances volumes, incidence, and use.

Protected areas might provide sanctuaries especially for sessile riparian plant species, but these niches are not always persistent over time. Objectives We investigate if plant species of floodplain forests are provided with suitable habitat within currently protected areas and if these refugia persist. A coupled-modelling approach is used to gain spatially explicit information on new areas for sanctuaries. Methods We use species distribution models to predict the niche of 12 Salicion albae and 7 Fraxinion floodplain forest species along rivers in Switzerland, under current, moderate and extreme climate change scenarios up to 80 years to the future (2100). The spread of plant species from current habitat to suitable future habitat is simulated using dispersal vectors and life history traits. Results Salicion albae species are more flexible under both climate change scenarios than Fraxinion species. The main limitation for the spread of species is their dispersal ability, as only a minority of the suitable cells is colonized during the simulation process. The predicted future presence within currently protected areas decreases under both climate change scenarios in the model. Conclusions Current protected floodplains do not provide persistent refugia for the plants studied, but might still be of importance to other organisms. Planning of sanctuaries for riparian plant species and communities need to focus on connectivity along rivers to maintain viable source populations in dynamic riverine landscapes under changing climate.

We integrate information relative to a multidimensional set of physical, geological, and socioeconomic variables, and add to the mainstream literature the consideration of both a reference and a climate change scenario, assuming the representative concentration pathway 8.5 W/m(2)(RCP8.5) for the 21st century in the Mediterranean region. Results report that approximately 1% (similar to 43 km(2)) of the mapped shoreline is classifiable as having a high or very high vulnerability, whereas approximately 80% (4652 km(2)) shows very low vulnerability. As expected, exposure to inundation and erosion is especially relevant in highly developed and urbanized coastal areas. Along the shoreline, while the Nile Delta region is the most prone area to coastal erosion and permanent or occasional inundations (both in the reference and in the climate scenario), results show the Western Desert area to be less vulnerable due to its geological characteristics (i.e., rocky and cliffed coasts, steeper coastal slope). The application of the CCVI to the coast of Egypt can be considered as a first screening of the hot-spot risk areas at the national scale. The results of the analysis, including vulnerability maps and indicators, can be used to support the development of climate adaptation and integrated coastal zone management strategies.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-12.

J	Gagné, K				Gagne, Karine			The materiality of ethics: Perspectives on water and reciprocity in a Himalayan Anthropocene	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						climate change; ethics; materiality; ontology; reciprocity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTIONS; REGION; LADAKH; LANDSCAPES	In the Himalayas, water is seen by some as intricately linked to humans and produced through ethical actions. Its materiality, as a lack or excess of rain or snow, as healthy or receding ice, as destructive hail or flash flood, is a reflection of humans' moral attitude and an outcome of a process of reciprocity that links humans to nonhumans, the land, and divine beings. This perspective departs from the conception of water seen through development projects and from studies about climate change, which tend to objectify water through an epistemology that isolates nature from culture. Water as the materiality of ethics is examined by drawing on cases from Ladakh and Zanskar in the Himalayas and by reviewing studies from other parts of the Himalayas. In particular, water as the materiality of ethics is analyzed through three perspectives: how water is produced as people interact with a sacred geography, how snowy peaks are produced as objects of morality through affective attachment and encounters, and how water is produced as part of multispecies assemblages. A review of an ontology of water defined by reciprocity is important considering the significant changes currently taking place in the Himalayas and which are brought about by climate change and state production through large-scale development projects. It can enrich our understanding of their implications for the cultural life of the often marginalized peoples of the Himalayas and contribute to narratives about the Anthropocene.

Accurate prediction of urban floods under heavy precipitation is critically important to address such a challenge as it can help understand the vulnerability of a city to future climate change and simulate the effectiveness of various sustainable engineering techniques in reducing urban flooding risks in real urban settings. Here, we propose a new model for urban flood prediction under heavy precipitation. The model divides an irregular urban area into many grid cells with no limitation on the spatial resolution as long as the DEM data of the same resolution are available. It is capable of reflecting the frequent inflow or outflow interactions among grid cells and capturing the rapid generation of surface runoff in urban areas during heavy rainfall. The model also accounts for typical characteristics of urban areas, such as large-scale impermeable surfaces and urban drainage systems, in order to simulate urban floods more realistically. In addition, the model uses both surface elevation and instantaneous surface water depth of all grid cells to dynamically determine the directions of horizontal inflow and outflow during each time step of model simulation. This enables the model to capture the reverse-flow phenomenon which is commonly seen in flat urban areas during heavy storms. By applying the proposed model for reproducing the 2016 flood in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting real-world flood events.

These include extreme rainfall and winds, and coastal hazards such as destructive waves, storm surges, estuarine flooding, and coastal erosion. Various aspects of TCs in the Australian region have been documented over the past several decades. In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on human-induced climate change effects on TCs in the Australian region and elsewhere around the globe. However, large natural variability and the lack of consistent long-term TC observations have often complicated the detection and attribution of TC trends. Efforts have been made to improve TC records for Australia over the past decades, but it is still unclear whether such records are sufficient to provide better understanding of the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change. It is important to note that the damage costs associated with tropical cyclones in Australia have increased in recent decades and will continue to increase due to growing coastal settlement and infrastructure development. Therefore, it is critical that any coastal infrastructure planning and engineering decisions, as well as disaster management decisions, strongly consider future risks from tropical cyclones. A better understanding of tropical cyclones in a changing climate will provide key insights that can help mitigate impacts of tropical cyclones on vulnerable communities. An objective assessment of the Australian TCs at regional scale and its link with climate variability and change using improved and up-to-date data records is more imperative now than before.

The impact of anthropogenic climate change on pediatric viral diseases	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Review; Early Access							CONGO HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS; ROSS RIVER VIRUS; SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; HIGHER ALTITUDES; AVIAN INFLUENZA; AIR-POLLUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH	The adverse effects of climate change on human health are unfolding in real time. Environmental fragmentation is amplifying spillover of viruses from wildlife to humans. Increasing temperatures are expanding mosquito and tick habitats, introducing vector-borne viruses into immunologically susceptible populations. More frequent flooding is spreading water-borne viral pathogens, while prolonged droughts reduce regional capacity to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks with adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene resources. Worsening air quality and altered transmission seasons due to an increasingly volatile climate may exacerbate the impacts of respiratory viruses. Furthermore, both extreme weather events and long-term climate variation are causing the destruction of health systems and large-scale migrations, reshaping health care delivery in the face of an evolving global burden of viral disease. Because of their immunological immaturity, differences in physiology (e.g., size), dependence on caregivers, and behavioral traits, children are particularly vulnerable to climate change. This investigation into the unique pediatric viral threats posed by an increasingly inhospitable world elucidates potential avenues of targeted programming and uncovers future research questions to effect equitable, actionable change.

Some households in these flood-affected communities have undertaken autonomous adaptations to flooding. We surveyed five hundred farm households from both flood-affected and unaffected villages to investigate the factors driving the uptake of the following autonomous flood adaptations: plinth elevation, grain storage, participation in communal flood preparations and the creation of edge-of-field tree lined shelterbelts. We used both binary and multivariate probit regressions to investigate the correlation across adaptation options. Empirical results suggest that access to agricultural extension services, off-farm work opportunities, past duration of standing floodwaters, farm to river distance, receiving post-flooding support and tribal diversity are the main drivers of flood adaptations. Moreover, we report the complementary uptake of adaptations in pairs. Given the prediction of climate change-driven flooding in the Hindu Kush, we recommend cost-effective policies that increase the resilience of vulnerable agricultural-dependent rural communities. In addition, we report that respondents perceived a change in weather towards hotter and dryer weather over the last ten years.

Existing SLR adaptation frameworks do not include Indigenous knowledge. Furthermore, SLR adaptation policy prioritizes economic and property rights and is misaligned with Indigenous coastal protection priorities. If Tribal Nations are to respond effectively to SLR then adaptation frameworks must be designed and developed by Indigenous Peoples for Indigenous Peoples. Eastern coastal Tribal Nations have a unique history of survival and resilience despite settler-colonial expansion in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of what is currently referred to as the United States. Experiences of eastern Atlantic coastal Tribal Nations highlight innovative response strategies for SLR adaptation and coastal stewardship practices not reflected in existing adaptation frameworks for the region. Indigenist SLR adaptation frameworks that utilize Indigenous knowledge are needed to combat water security issues resulting from SLR risks such as flooding, saltwater intrusion, storm surge, and erosion. This article proposes the WAMPUM adaptation framework informed by northeastern and mid-Atlantic coastal Tribal Nation science and knowledge systems for climate change adaptation to SLR.

J	Fayombo, OO				Fayombo, Olasimbo Omolara			Discursive constructions underlie and exacerbate the vulnerability of informal urban communities to the impacts of climate change	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Adaptation; vulnerability; cities; urban development; climate change	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; COASTAL COMMUNITIES; SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; URBANIZATION; DISCOURSE; CITIES; LAGOS	In the literature, the power of material deprivation in fostering the vulnerability of marginal urban areas is well documented. However, other forms of power that drive and underlie the exercise of material deprivation are rarely examined. The recent call for a more politicized view of adaptation reiterates the need to highlight and pay attention to the influence of other sources of power that drives vulnerability and underlie material deprivation. In response, this paper, through a discourse analysis of statements from urban actors at different levels and from documents/literature, examines the power of discursive constructions in fostering adaptation deficits and entrenching the vulnerability of residents of informal spaces. Through the lens of Lagos, the paper draws attention to how the imbued power relations emanating from dominant discourses fosters 'misrecognition' and facilitates 'adaptation deficit'. It highlights the discursive constructions on residents of urban informal areas as underlying and exacerbating the people's vulnerability to climate change impacts like flooding. The paper suggests that addressing this subtle but potent power through recognition and 'un-naming' will facilitate viable development and adaptation policies that promote the inclusion objectives of the sustainable development goals.

As the climate changes, sea level is expected to rise causing instances of flooding as well as increased storm intensity triggering increased coastal erosion and coastal flooding along vulnerable shorelines. San Mateo County, the basis of this research is one of the most vulnerable areas in the United States for coastal flooding, erosion and climate change. San Mateo County's geography is unique in the sense that the County is set on a narrow peninsula surrounded by the San Francisco Bay on the East and the Pacific Ocean on the West. The population is concentrated primarily on the "bay side" whereas the population is considerably less dense on the "coast side" adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. Research was conducted in order to measure stakeholder perception of risk and to uncover discrepancies between risk identified by a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) and risk as perceived by social, economic and environmental stakeholders.

The paper took the western route source areas (WRSA) of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) as the research region. In order to quantify climate-induced eco-hydrological effects, a general framework was proposed to predict changes in flow regimes and fluvial biodiversity under climate change: The coupling of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the Distributed Time Variant Gain Model (DTVGM) was used to simulate discharge under different climate conditions. Based on Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), changes in eco-hydrological regimes were evaluated by using the Range of Variability Approach (RVA), assessment of overall hydrological change degree (D0), and Shannon index (SI). Changes in discharge, flow regimes, and fluvial biodiversity of WRSA were analyzed during the projected period (2041-2100) compared to the base period (1960-2014). According to the projections, under four SSPs-RCPs scenarios, the future discharge of WRSA increases significantly compared to the base period. D0 of WRSA is moderately or severely changed, and hydrological changes are mainly reflected in high flows such as monthly median flows during flood season, maximum flows, and high pulse duration. While flow regimes are disturbed, SI values of WRSA keep rising and the biodiversity is improved. The increase of discharge and SI becomes progressively greater with elevated radiation intensity, and the quantity of severely altered indicators of IHA increases. In conclusion, future hydrological alterations in SNWDP are expected to further intensify with higher levels of climate change, and these changes are generally conducive to the improvement of fish biodiversity.

Such events boost the transport of allochthonous organic matter (allo-OM) to freshwater ecosystems, yet little is known about the impacts on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and seston elemental stoichiometry, especially for lakes in warm climates. A mesocosm experiment located in a Turkish freshwater lake was designed to simulate a pulse event leading to increased inputs of allo-OM by examining the individual effects of increasing water colour (HuminFeed (R), HF), the direct effects of the extra energetic inputs (alder tree leaf leachate, L), and the interactions of the single treatment effects (combination of both sources, HFL), along with a comparison with unmanipulated controls. Changes in the DOM quality and nutrient stoichiometry of the allo-OM treatment additions was examined over the course of the experiments. Results indicated that there was an increase of high recalcitrant DOM components in the HF treatment, in contrast to an increase in less aromatic microbially derived molecules for the L treatment. Unexpectedly, seston C:P ratios remained below a severe P-limiting threshold for plankton growth and showed the same temporal pattern in all mesocosms. In contrast, seston N:P ratios differed significantly between treatments, with the L treatment reducing P-limiting conditions, whilst the HF treatment increased them. The effects of the combined HFL treatment indicated an additive type of interaction and chlorophyll-a was highest in the HFL treatment. Our results demonstrate that accounting for the optical and stoichiometric properties of experimental allo-OM treatments is crucial to improve the capacity to explain extrapolated conclusions regarding the effects of climate driven flooding on freshwater ecosystems in response to global climate change.

The inference of nonstationarity from trend tests (INTT) on historical floods is a widespread practice used to justify the application of NFFA; however, its reliability has seldom been investigated. This research examines future floods from interpretations of INTT compared to those obtained from cause-and-effect processes by a hydrological model (INCE). The study uses INCE to quantify the changes in the regime and magnitude of floods due to potential climate change in the mid-21st century using mull-model ensemble simulations under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Independent peaks over threshold from simulated streamflow were used to estimate the changes in future (2040-2064) flood regimes and magnitudes compared to their historical (1983-2007) counterparts for 29 unregulated catchments across Alberta, Canada. Separation of extreme events and their fittings to generalized Pareto distributions (GPD) were based on a hybrid approach that combined two developed automated threshold selection methods and four estimators for the parameters of the GPD. Based on comparing the results of INTT and INCE, we show that future changes in floods contradict. We also show that the future frequency curves shifted differently at different return periods compared to historical curves, while in some instances, future climate tended to decrease small floods and increase larger floods or vice versa. Finally, flood magnitudes in 2/3 of the studied catchments in Alberta are predicted to intensify, accompanied by increases in the rate of occurrence and earlier shifts in the timing of floods for both climate scenarios, whereas no considerable change in the duration was recognized.

Impact of climate change on precipitation patterns in Houston, Texas, USA	ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Precipitation; Climate change; Indices; Clear Creek watershed	EXTREME EVENTS; FUTURE CHANGES; FLOOD RISK; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; TEMPERATURE; INTENSITY; DROUGHT; TRENDS	Extreme precipitation events damage infrastructure and property; thus, predicting future precipitation patterns in the context of climate change is important. In this study, precipitation projections from 36 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) enabled examination of projected changes in future precipitation for the Clear Creek watershed in Houston, Texas, USA. Precipitation from 1950 to 2099 simulated with GCM were downscaled using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation method. Ten precipitation indices that represent precipitation amount, precipitation intensity, precipitation duration, and precipitation frequency evaluated how precipitation patterns will likely change. Results show that, at the annual scale, mean precipitation will significantly decrease based on RCP8.5, or remain relatively constant based on RCP2.6. Precipitation intensity and precipitation variability, however, will likely increase. Dry periods will lengthen significantly, whereas the length of wet spells will generally remain unchanged. At the monthly scale, the amount of precipitation, precipitation intensity, precipitation frequency and the length of wet spells will likely increase in September. In contrast, precipitation will likely decrease and dry spells will lengthen in April, May, August, November, and December. This finding illustrates that the intra-annual variability in precipitation will increase. The projected changes in precipitation under RCP8.5 are generally greater compared with RCP2.6. Differences between the scenarios are more pronounced towards the end of the century. Houston has recently experienced substantial precipitation variability, including severe drought and record-breaking precipitation from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. These events are consistent with the long-term GCM projections. Findings from this study can be applied to help manage water resources and enhance adaptability to climate change.

J	Osman, B				Osman, Balikisu			Climate and Food Insecurity Risks: Identifying Exposure and Vulnerabilities in the Post-Food Production System of Northern Ghana	LAND			English	Article						climate change; food security; food system; risk; vulnerabilities; northern Ghana	SEISMIC HAZARD ASSESSMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; DROUGHT HAZARD; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; IMPACTS	Evidence shows how food system activities, from production to consumption, underpin food security. However, studies exploring climate impacts on food security in northern Ghana have overly focused on production systems, neglecting post-production activities that loom large in food security. This paper addresses the research need to comprehensively analyze how climate change and weather variabilities affect post-production activities and exacerbate food insecurity risks in northern Ghana. It analyzes data on climate hazards, impacts, and food system vulnerabilities using questionnaires and participatory engagement with farming households in northern Ghana. Results show that climate-induced food insecurity risks in northern Ghana are not just products of persistent exposure to climate hazards and their impacts on food production in the region. Instead, risks are inextricably connected to the vulnerability contexts within which food is harvested, processed, stored, and marketed. Specifically, the results reveal that climate hazard events such as floods, extreme temperatures, and droughts damage stored grain, disrupt food supply to the market, and cause seasonal volatilities in food prices. However, these impacts are not solely externally generated circumstances. The food system is highly vulnerable; most households lack access to threshing and grinding machines, warehouse storage, post-harvest management information, and transportation services. These underlying characteristics of the post-food production system of northern Ghana, which is ultimately quite remote from climate change and weather variabilities, exacerbate household-level food insecurity risks.

Temporal downscaling of daily precipitation to 10 min data for assessment of climate change impact on floods in small-size watersheds applied to Jinju, South Korea	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Climate change; Daily precipitation; Extreme events; 10 min precipitation; RCP; Temporal downscaling	RISK; ADAPTATION; MAXIMUM	The earth system model (ESM) mostly provides an output of hydrological variables at a daily scale, such as precipitation. Finer temporal scale data of precipitation is required for assessing the impact of climate change on floods, especially in small-size urban and mountainous watersheds which are vulnerable to floods. This study enhanced population-based nonparametric temporal downscaling (PNTD) to downscale daily precipitation to 10-min precipitation (P10M), and tested it in the Jinju area, South Korea, that includes both urban and mountainous areas. Results indicated that the enhanced PNTD model reproduced the key statistics of the P10M data and the statistical characteristics of extreme events represented by the annual maximum precipitation (AMP) series of different durations. Also, the daily precipitation of 19 ESMs with the base and future scenarios, called shared socio-economic pathways, for 245 and 585 conditions were applied and downscaled to P10M data. It was found that the future P10M precipitation scenarios were downscaled satisfactorily by preserving the difference between base and future scenarios of the AMP data. Also, results showed that the uncertainty from ESMs was about 10 times larger than from temporal downscaling and it indicated that the uncertainty in temporal downscaling can be acceptable.

Impacts of the expected number of people flooded annually and wetland losses were assessed. To assess the benefits of mitigation, it was assumed that defences were not upgraded during the study. Globally, with a sealevel rise of 0.68 m by the 2080s (with respect to 1980-99), representing a potential future with limited climate-change mitigation, and with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1 socio-economic scenario, 123 million additional people could be flooded annually and 39% of present global wetland stock could be lost. For a 0.19-m rise in sea level, associated with a substantial reduction in emissions, the number of people flooded could be reduced to 13 million/y, with 21% of global wetland stock loss, unless new wetlands emerge. Collectively, non-Annex 1 G-20 countries experience a disproportionately higher number of people flooded in their nations compared with the proportion of population flooded globally. The greatest wetland losses for G-20 countries are projected for Australia, Indonesia, and the United States. Thus, G-20 nations with the highest emissions or gross domestic product frequently do not experience the greatest impacts, despite some of these nations being potentially more able to pay for adaptation.

They also have unique potential to catalyze the transformative sustainable change that the world needs now. How can this potential be leveraged? In this perspective, we present the sustainability motive -alignment hypothesis to understand and harness young peoples', especially adolescents', potential for sustainable engagement. The hypothesis posits that adolescents will be internally motivated to engage in sustainable behavior when they construe such behavior as a means of pursuing their personal motives for autonomy and status. The hypothesis also suggests that sustainability-promoting policies (educational programs, campaigns) can be improved by using techniques that reshape how adolescents construe sustainability-from a low-priority chore to an activity that embodies a personal priority. We discuss research priorities to expand and evaluate the sustainability motive-alignment hypothesis and to help better under-stand the psychological forces underlying adolescents' sustainable engagement.

However, flows are hard to monitor and are therefore hardly measured in some places, especially those most affected by climate change, where floods are increasingly severe, causing great damage to facilities and the general population. In particular, in ephemeral streams, typical of semi-arid climates, flash floods may occur as they have a rapid response to a rainfall event and floods are of a sudden nature. In this article, we introduce an in situ and Mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) monitoring system for efficient real-time flow measurement in ephemeral streams. Our system is deployed in the Mar Menor watershed (Murcia, SE Spain), the first ecosystem in Europe with a legal entity, promoted by the citizens in the face of the environmental crisis that is besetting it.

However, the specific change characteristics and their responses to changes in influencing factors remain unclear. Based on the multi-year flow data of several typical basins in the QTP permafrost regions, combined with the flow duration curve and percentile flow, this study analyzed the variability of annual peak discharge, Q5, Q10, and Q30 (5%, 10%, and 30% percentile flows in the flow duration curve, respectively) and their response relationships with different climate change factors. In addition, the corresponding relationships between different percentile high flows and annual hydrographs were analyzed. The results indicate that, in the context of global warming, changes in the high flows in permafrost regions are bidirectional, either rising or falling, or both. Moreover, the responses of different percentile high flows to climate change are seasonally distinct. Spring high flows are more sensitive to changes in air temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and summer and autumn high flows are more susceptible to corresponding changes in seasonal average precipitation and rainfall intensity. In addition, different percentile high flows can be used to predetermine the level of annual flood events. Among them, the largest, the larger, and all other general flood events during the annual flood season, can be defined by Q5, Q10, and Q30, respectively. The analysis of different high flows combined with the flow duration curve is essential for the further clarifi-cation of the hydrological processes in permafrost regions. The prudent utilization of water resources benefits the sustainable development of human society.

However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensing-hydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations.

An integrated framework of coastal flood modelling under the failures of sea dikes: a case study in Shanghai	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Tropical cyclone; Sea level rise; Climate change; Coastal flooding; Dike failure	TROPICAL CYCLONE INTENSITY; TYPHOON-INDUCED FLOODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEVEL RISE; LAND SUBSIDENCE; IMPACTS; INTENSIFICATION; CMIP5; HURRICANES; CITIES	Climate change leads to sea level rise worldwide, as well as increases in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs). Storm surge induced by TC's, together with spring tides, threatens to cause failure of flood defenses, resulting in massive flooding in low-lying coastal areas. However, limited research has been done on the combined effects of the increasing intensity of TCs and sea level rise on the characteristics of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes. This paper investigates the spatial variation of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes subject to past and future TC climatology and sea level rise, via a case study of a low-lying deltaic city- Shanghai, China. Using a hydrodynamic model and a spectral wave model, storm tide and wave parameters were calculated as input for an empirical model of overtopping discharge rate. The results show that the change of storm climatology together with relative sea level rise (RSLR) largely exacerbates the coastal hazard for Shanghai in the future, in which RSLR is likely to have a larger effect than the TC climatology change on future coastal flooding in Shanghai. In addition, the coastal flood hazard will increase to a large extent in terms of the flood water volume for each corresponding given return period. The approach developed in this paper can also be utilized to investigate future flood risk for other low-lying coastal regions.

In this study, an integrated framework is proposed to determine the range of compound flood risk without the requirement of joint probability analysis between storm surge and rainfall. In the framework, the flood risks are analyzed under four extreme scenarios with/without the compound effect of storm surge and rainfall in the past and the future. From the end of the 20th century to the middle of the 21st century, the worst scenario shows that the flood area significantly increases by 92% for the low-lying coastal areas in southwest Taiwan under the compound effect of storm surge and rainfall if they are fully correlated. In the most optimistic scenario, the flood area slightly increases by 15% without compound effect (only storm surge is considered). To coastal flooding, the synchronization of storm surge and rainfall contributes much more than the climate-induced amplification of individual factors. When storm surge and rainfall happen at the same time, the extent and duration of flooding increase simultaneously under the influence of pluvial and surge-induced flooding. Risk analysis shows an obvious increase of risk level for villages originally at low risks, which require integrated countermeasures against the consequence brought by compound flooding in the future. The framework can be applied in other low-lying coastal areas to quantify the potential impacts on human and environment caused by compound flooding under climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the seven climate scenarios from CMIP5 climate models under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, responses of hydrological process to climate change were simulated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Variation analysis results indicated that recorded temperature presented significant increasing trend. Daily minimum temperature presented higher increasing trend than daily maximum temperature. Annual gross precipitation presented minor increasing and annual runoff presented minor decreasing. The VIC model performed well on simulating monthly discharge at Tangnaihai station, withNSEof 0.91 and 0.93 in calibration and validation periods, respectively. The projected annual mean temperature would rise (with 25th and 75th percentiles) 1.07-1.32 degrees C, 1.76-2.33 degrees C, 3.45-4.29 degrees C, annual precipitation is expected to increase 3.43%-11.77%, 8.05%-17.27%, 12.84%-27.89%, and runoff would moderately increase with high variability of 0.82%-14.26%, -3.41%-19.14%, 1.43%-38.26% relative to the baseline of 1961-1990 under each RCP in the 2080s, respectively. The inhomogeneity of runoff may increase in the future. Many more droughts and floods under climate change may threaten social development in this region in the future.

Therefore, in this paper we focused on the investigation of the low- and high-flow characteristics of the karst Ljubljanica River catchment. One smaller (51 km(2)) and one larger (1135 km(2)) catchment were selected in order to investigate the projected climate change impact on the hydrological conditions. For the investigation of the hydrological situation in the future, we used a lumped conceptual hydrological model. The model was calibrated using past measured daily data. Using the calibrated model, we investigated the impact of five different climate models outputs for the moderately optimistic scenario (RCP4.5). We investigated the situation in next 30-years periods: 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. Several low and high-flow indices were calculated and compared. The results indicate that a summer precipitation decrease (i.e., 2011-2070) could lead to lower low-flow values for the investigated areas, which could increase the vulnerability of karst areas. Thus, additional focus should be given to water resource management in karst areas. On the other hand, mean flow could increase in the future. The same also applies for the high-flows where flood frequency analysis results indicate that a climate adaptation factor could be used for the hydrotechnical engineering design. However, differences among investigated models are large and show large variability among investigated cases.

In particular, a more detailed understanding of hydrological cycle response to transient climate change is required for successful adaptation and mitigation policies. In this study, we exploit large ensemble model experiments using the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2 (CESM1) in which CO2 concentrations increase steadily and then decrease along the same path. Our results show that precipitation changes in the CO2 increasing and decreasing phases are nearly symmetrical over land but asymmetric over oceans. After CO2 concentrations peak, the ocean continues to uptake heat from the atmosphere, which is a key process leading the hydrological cycles contrasting response over land and ocean. The symmetrical hydrological cycle response over land involves a complex interplay between rapid responses to CO2 and slower responses to ensuing warming. Therefore, the surface energy constraints lead to the contrasting hydrological response over land and ocean to CO2 forcing that needs to be verified and considered in climate change mitigation and adaption actions.

Farmers' perspective towards climate change vulnerability, risk perceptions, and adaptation measures in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Farm vulnerability; Risk perceptions; Adaptation; Farm-level constraints; Pakistan; Influencing factors	PUNJAB PROVINCE; FOOD SECURITY; STRATEGIES; LEVEL; DETERMINANTS; PREPAREDNESS; AGRICULTURE; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS	Pakistan has become a highly vulnerable country with considerable exposure to climate change. Over the past few decades, Pakistan has endured many severe floods, droughts, and storms. However, limited research was conducted into farmers' perspectives towards climate change vulnerability, risk perceptions, and adaptation measures at the farm level in Pakistan. The current research uses a dataset of 600 farm households collected through a structured questionnaire from four districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The study identified the farm level climatic risks perceived by the farm households including flood (60%), crop pest (56%), insect attacks (55%), extreme temperatures (54%), human diseases (54%), and livestock diseases (46%). The farm households also reported negative impacts (decrease in crop production, waterlogging, and changes in cropping calendars and positive effects (e.g., better crop production) arising from changing climate and associated threats. Further, this study identified different adaptation strategies adopted at the farm level to mitigate the adverse effects and related risks of rising climatic conditions that include changing crop varieties (37%), planting shade trees (32%), changing planting dates (31%), changing methods of fertilizer usage (26%), changing crop type (14%), soil conservation measures (11%) and crop diversification (9%). The logistic regression analysis revealed that the farm experience, education, land area, ZTBL credit, and climatic information from the relevant government department were important factors that influenced farm household adaptation measures in the study areas. Also, the study found that farm households had faced numerous constraints that could influence adaptation decisions, including financial constraints (28%), lack of knowledge and information (25%), inadequate farm resources (23%) in the study areas. Other restrictions to adaptations included the lack of public or private institutional support (14%), and lack of irrigation water (10%). The present research shows the need to implement policies that tackle adaptation barriers, and ensure that local institutions are available and ready to provide farmers with more up-to-date information and farm advisory to combat climate change and its negative consequences.

Out of 127 reviewed studies, findings indicated the wider spread of infectious diseases, and increased mortality and hospitalisation risks associated with extreme heat, droughts, and floods. However, there are few studies addressing health cost, awareness, engagement, adaptation, and policy. Additional analyses showed rising heatwave exposure across Vietnam and global above-average vulnerability to heat. By 2050, climate change is projected to cost up to USD1-3B in healthcare costs, USD3-20B in premature deaths, and USD6-23B in work loss. Despite increased media focus on climate and health, a gap between public and government publications highlighted the need for more governmental engagement.

The resulting sea level rise is starting to be noticed in some regions today, and based on projections, could have severe consequences in the future. These consequences would primarily be felt by residents of coastal areas, but through the potential for irreparable damage to cultural heritage sites, could be significant for the general public. The primary aim of the research undertaken in this article was to assess the threat to cultural heritage objects on the case study area of Tri-City, Poland. A review of available elevation data sources for their potential use in analyses of sea level changes was required. The selection of the optimal data source for the cultural heritage threat analysis of historic sites was carried out. The analyses were conducted for three scenarios, using ArcGIS Pro 2.7 software. A series of maps were thus prepared to show the threats to specific historic sites for various global sea level rise scenarios. Even with the slightest rise in sea level, monuments could be permanently lost. The authors point out that a lack of action to stop climate change could result not only in economic but also cultural losses.

Steps towards Modeling Community Resilience under Climate Change: Hazard Model Development	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						total water level; tropical cyclones; climate change; coastal resilience; coupled model system	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; HURRICANE WAVES; RAINFALL-RUNOFF; WIND; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; BASIN; SWAN	With a growing population (over 40%) living in coastal counties within the U.S., there is an increasing risk that coastal communities will be significantly impacted by riverine/coastal flooding and high winds associated with tropical cyclones. Climate change could exacerbate these risks; thus, it would be prudent for coastal communities to plan for resilience in the face of these uncertainties. In order to address all of these risks, a coupled physics-based modeling system has been developed that simulates total water levels. This system uses parametric models for both rainfall and wind, which only require essential information (e.g., track and central pressure) generated by a hurricane model. The system is validated with Hurricane Isabel hindcasts: One using the parametric system and another using data assimilated fields. The results show a good agreement to the available data, indicating that the system is able to adequately capture the hazards using parametric models, as compared to optimized fields. The validated system was then utilized to simulate randomly generated scenarios that account for future uncertainty, i.e., amount of sea level rise and storm strength/track, as influenced by projected climate change scenarios. Results are then used in next step in the development of a system-wide, community resilience model.

Rapid, risk-based levee design framework for greater risk reduction at lower cost than standards-based design	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; coastal flood risk; levee design standards; risk analysis; storm surge	DEFENSE SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTIONS; OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM; BORG	Standards-based levee design aims to protect against events with specific probabilities, for example eliminating overtopping from a storm surge with a 1% annual exceedance probability (i.e., a "100-year" event). This allows levee segments to be analyzed independently but ignores interior dynamics and overall risk. We present and implement a framework for calculating optimal risk-informed design heights. Using this design paradigm and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, we identify levee and floodwall design heights that minimize the total system cost and expected flood losses over 50 years. With our model, decision makers may feasibly evaluate hundreds or thousands of alternative designs over a large ensemble of future states of the world. Comparing to the existing design elevations of the Larose to Golden Meadow Hurricane Protection Project in coastal Louisiana, over multiple climate change scenarios, we identify system configurations of similar cost that reduce the expected value of discounted residual risk of 26%-73% ($8-85 million). We also achieve the same residual risk at 90%-97% of the cost of the existing system (saving $19-73 million).

Given the diversity of impacts depending on the region, there is a need for local and dedicated studies to understand and mitigate the risks. Numerical models can provide forecasts of extreme floods and sea-level rise (SLR). However, they can present inaccuracies. In this work, the ensemble technique was applied to improve the numerical modeling forecasting for estuaries by considering scenarios of extreme river flow discharges (EFDs) and SLR scenarios for 2050 and 2100. The simulations were performed for two different estuarine regions in northern Portugal, and the superensemble was constructed with the results of two different numerical models. The results differed per estuary, highlighting the importance of a local approach. For the Douro estuary dynamics, the results showed that for the EFD, the effects of the SLR were not noticeable, indicating that, in this estuary, the river component was more important than the maritime component. In contrast, the Minho estuary dynamics were found to be affected by the SLR along the whole estuarine region, indicating a maritime influence and a worsening of the flood conditions for future scenarios.

We assess this risk, for the case of floods, by developing a simple model of the propagation of climate-induced shocks through financial networks. We show that the magnitude of global risks is determined by the interplay between the exposure of countries to climate-related natural hazards and their financial leverage. Climate change induces a shift in the distribution of impacts towards high-income countries and thus larger amplification of impacts as the financial sectors of high-income countries are more leveraged. Conversely, high-income countries are more exposed to financial shocks. In high-end climate scenarios, this could lead to the emergence of systemic risk as total impacts become commensurate with the capital of the banking sectors of countries that are hubs of the global financial network. Adaptation policy, or the lack thereof, appears to be one of the key risk drivers as it determines the future exposure of high-income countries. This implies in particular that the avoided costs in terms of financial stability should be weighted in as benefits of adaptation policy.

In mountainous regions, protection against gravitational hazards is of particular importance. By preventing soil erosion and functioning as natural barriers and buffers, forests protect the population and infrastructure against avalanches and rock falls. The higher the forests' capacity to regulate and withstand external disturbances and adverse effects the higher the insurance value they provide. To operationalize the insurance value approach and to integrate it into climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, information about supply and demand of this ecosystem service is required. While assessing the capacity of forests to provide protection services has been a longstanding research focus, knowledge about the population's demand for insurance services provided by forests is still lacking. Our study analyzes the preferences of beneficiaries of such services. We conducted a choice experiment in several Swiss municipalities exposed to avalanches and rock falls, accounting for different spatial and institutional contexts. We found that households are willing to pay a significant amount for forest management that enhances forests' insurance services and reduces natural hazard risks. The results help to inform decision making in natural hazard management, and represent a further step towards operationalizing the insurance value of ecosystems.

In contrast, projections of changes in precipitation totals in Poland are not clear and obvious. Analysis of long-term observational series reveals no clear significant trends in levels of precipitation, despite periods of fluctuation, as well as an upward trend reported in the annual amount of precipitation, especially in northern Poland. However, the increasing variability of annual rainfall totals is commonly highlighted. In the years 1861-1990, the coefficient of variation of annual precipitation totals increased from about 10% to 16%. In the years 1971-2000, this coefficient for Poland increased to 17%, and in the period of 2001-2018, which is the subject of the present study, to 19%. Despite the lack of clear trends in annual totals, the increase in the coefficient of variation results in an increase in the frequency of both drought and floods. This unfavorable situation is exacerbated by the downward trend observed in the share of summer rainfall in the annual total. In urban areas with increasing surface sealing, the share of surface runoff in the water balance increases, and in this situation short-term rainfall will cause local flooding.

The data set showed a significant increasing trend of EHEs before 2000, while a slight post-2000 decline. Correspondingly, the EHE-caused economic losses increased obviously before 2000 followed by a slight decrease; the post-2000 decline could be partially attributed to the decreases in drought and flood-prone area or climate adaptation practices. Spatially, Asia experienced most EHEs (969), corresponding to the largest share of economic losses (approximately $868 billion for floods and $50 billion for droughts, respectively), while Oceania had the least EHEs (102) and the least economic losses (approximately $19 billion for floods and $45 billion for droughts). The five countries with the highest EHE-caused economic losses were China, United States, Canada, Australia, and India. Countries that suffered the highest flood-caused economic losses were China, United States, and Canada. This data set provides a quantitative linkage between climate science and economic losses at a global scale, and it is beneficial for the regional climatic impact assessments and strategical development for mitigating climate change impacts.

By disturbing the balance in different parts of the earth we have seen negative results like a flood, drought, etc., so based on the importance that climate change has on the earth and its residents, and long term prediction of climate parameters has always been of interest. One of the most popular and appropriate methods for evaluation of future climate is using atmosphere general circulation model that by using micro scaling models and different scenarios of climate change, it tries to predict climatic parameters for the future. this research, for predicting climatic parameters in Lar dam basin by using SDSM micro scaling model and by using temperature and daily rainfall of synoptic station area in base period (1984-1995) one wants to create statistical downscaling to estimate climatic oscillations, also model efficiency amount evaluated based on correlation coefficient statistical test R-2 and standard error (RMSE) that results confirmed relative and acceptable adaptation of simulated values by model and observed values in basic period (observations), in next level by using outputs of CanESM2 model and based on 3 scenarios of Rcp1 2/6, Rcp 4/5 and Rcp 8/5 they predicted parameters of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall in period of years (2020-2060). The results of this research show that the temperature average in the considered region (1/01 to 1/12 degree centigrade) and the average rainfall amount increases by about 21/23 percent based on three considered scenarios. By regarding gained results in period (2020-2060) Lar dam region witnessing tangible climate change towards current situation that by regarding Lar dam strategic situation in this region and issue of water supply by the dam, long term and strategic planning is necessary for the management of these conditions.

This will play a key role in the future decades due to climate change. Therefore, having reliable predictions of the outflow from a reservoir is necessary for early warning systems and adequate water management. In this sense, this study uses three approaches machine learning (ML)-based techniques-Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN)-to predict outflow one day ahead of eight different dams belonging to the Mino-Sil Hydrographic Confederation (Galicia, Spain), using three input variables of the current day. Mostly, the results obtained showed that the suggested models work correctly in predicting reservoir outflow in normal conditions. Among the different ML approaches analyzed, ANN was the most appropriate technique since it was the one that provided the best model in five reservoirs.

Climate change impacts disproportionately affect the livelihoods of women engaged in informal work like weaving from their homes and street vending. Existing research suggests that women are more likely to be among the most vulnerable in such extreme events as well as are vital agents to develop climate resilience within their communities. We draw upon unique quantitative and qualitative data to critically examine the lived experiences of female informal workers from Leh, Ladakh (India). Drawing on the work of Duchek (2020), we explore how women informal workers navigate their daily strategies of anticipating, coping, and adapting toward climate change. From this analysis, we offer novel empirical evidence about gendered climate resilience and suggest broad recommendations for building climate resilience within mountain communities.

J	Somerville, P				Somerville, Peter			The continuing failure of UK climate change mitigation policy	CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						decarbonisation; global emergency; new green deal	ENERGY; HEAT	Failure to take climate change seriously enough has resulted in the world now facing a climate emergency, with rising global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods and droughts, and rising sea levels. Despite being the first country in the world to set statutory carbon emissions reduction targets (in the Climate Change Act 2008), the UK government since 2012 has fallen increasingly behind, even by its own standards. This paper details what this has meant in terms of specific policies and identifies some of the reasons for this policy failure: in particular, a negative attitude towards regulation and a return to a reliance on market forces, plus an overriding concern to continue with 'business as usual', in terms of support for fossil-fuel industries and ever-increasing energy demand and supply. Ironically, this has resulted in a situation where radical solutions seem even more necessary and more urgent.

J	Bak, J; Królikowska, J				Bak, Joanna; Krolikowska, Jadwiga			Current Status and Possibilities of Implementing Green Walls for Adaptation to Climate Change of Urban Areas on the Example of Krakow	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA			English	Article						rainwater; green infrastructure; green wall	FACADES	Extreme weather events such as: high temperatures, heat waves, torrential and heavy rains, strong winds or floods are increasingly frequent symptoms of climate change. As predicted by climatologists, they would keep occurring more and more often and their intensity would increase. Flooding and floods are the biggest threats to the agglomeration. They pose a great danger not only directly to residents' property, but also cause severe economic losses, e.g. during a temporary interruption of a production process. Adaptation to climate change can be supported not only by new technologies, but also by some trends in spatial planning, i.e. activities related to installation of green infrastructure throughout the city. Water and green perfectly fit into an urbanized space. The article investigates how green walls can participate in adaptation of the city of Krakow to climate changes. The term of the green wall was also discussed and the own its definition was proposed. The aim of the research was to find locations of green walls in the city of Krakow and then visually assess their spatial structure and density. On the basis of this data, areas for potential growing of green infrastructures in a selected settlement unit were identified. The research material comprised the map of Krakow and information obtained during a preliminary inventory of the Krakow's green walls. The map of Krakow's green walls has been completed on the basis of cartographic data from OpenStreetMap.org . In addition, the materials form the state geodetic and cartographic resources were used. The map was developed using the QGIS program - version 2.4.0. The authors created a map of green walls in Krakow along the main communication routes. The map is made up of spatial data in a digital form, as two vector layers linked with the city map. There were just a few plant species planted on the green walls. However, a large variety of constructions on which vegetation occurred was observed. The map of green walls along the most important communication routes in Krakow allowed to identify potential places for new plantings and to assess a spatial structure of green infrastructure. There is a large number of green walls in the city, but their density is not large, yet. There are many places that are potential locations for greening. Particular attention should be paid to shopping centers, as there are many ways to introduce this form of green infrastructure in their area. Only if at a high density, greenery will help to overcome effects of climate change in the city.				jbak@pk.edu.pl							17	2	2	1	14	MIDDLE POMERANIAN SCI SOC ENV PROT	KOSZALIN	KOLLATAJA 1-1, KOSZALIN, 75-448, POLAND	1506-218X			ROCZ OCHR SR	Rocz.

Two objectives were included in this model, which are the minimization of total system costs and the maximization of total pollutant treatment amounts. The major advantage of the proposed MIBCCP model is that it realized the effective combined utilization of conventional and nonconventional water sources under complexities and uncertainties through incorporating compromise programming, birandom chance-constrained programming, and interval linear programming within a general framework. This way effectively overcomes water shortage issue and reduces urban flood frequency under climate change. A water supply management system of the educational park in Tianjin was used as a study case for demonstration. A variety of adaptive water allocation alternatives and construction schemes for LID (low-impact development) projects under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5) scenarios were obtained to deal with possible changes arising from increasing rainfall and runoff in the future. It is concluded that the proposed MIBCCP model provided the effective linkage between the utilization of nonconventional water resources and urban flood prevention and offered insights into the trade-off between economic benefits and environmental protection.

Hydrogen sulfide in horticulture: Emerging roles in the era of climate change	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Antioxidants; Climate change; Hydrogen sulfide; Nitric oxide; Plant stress; Reactive oxygen species; Oxidative damage	INDUCED STOMATAL CLOSURE; ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE SYSTEM; NITRIC-OXIDE; CHILLING TOLERANCE; DROUGHT STRESS; FLOOD RISK; H2S; SENESCENCE; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES	Future climate change will present many plants with environmental challenges, including extreme temperatures and drought. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as an important signal transmitting molecule in plants, especially important in many stress responses and it is known to regulate numerous physiological and developmental processes. Being recently suggested as a signaling molecule, research exploring the regulatory functions is continuously progressing regarding the role of H2S in plant science, agriculture and horticulture. Biosynthesis of H2S occurs in different cellular compartments from where it can freely translocate via membranes to where needed or be excluded where not required. H2S interacts with related signaling molecules which together mediate stress tolerance against a plethora of harsh conditions. The H2S induced tolerance against stresses occurs via regulation of antioxidants activities, endogenous levels of GSH, osmoregulator accumulation, cell signaling proteins, and stress-related gene expression. Overall this efficiently eliminates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintains the intracellular redox balance. The current review summarizes the recent progress on H2S or H2S donor-mediated abiotic stress tolerance with special reference to climate change and horticulture crops, pre- and post-harvest. Elucidating the role of H2S in cell signaling pathways may open new horizons towards understanding how exogenous treatments with H2S in horticulture plants may aid in the tolerance to stress, especially as environmental conditions change, and can secure better crop yields and avoid post-harvest losses.

When the fraction of attributable risk does not inform the impact associated with anthropogenic climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Letter						Extreme event attribution; Climate change impacts; Damage function; Social cost of carbon	EXTREME WEATHER	Weather and climate phenomena have outsized impacts on society when they are particularly extreme. Extreme Event Attribution (EEA) seeks to quantify the extent to which extreme weather and climate phenomena are the result of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), and thus it has implications for many pertinent climate change discussions, including those on potential legal claims of loss and damages and calculations of the social cost of carbon. The Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) is one metric that is used to quantify the proportion of an extreme weather or climate "event" associated with ACC. The FAR is typically applied to changes in the likelihood of exceeding some geophysical value chosen, post hoc, to represent the "event" (e.g., i.e., rainfall amounts, flood depths, drought measures, temperature values, etc.). The FAR has further been used to estimate the fraction of observed impacts (e.g., lives lost or economic damage) that can be associated with ACC by multiplying realized impacts by the FAR (IFAR = ImpactxFAR). Here, we illustrate with a few stylized examples that this IFAR calculation only produces reliably useful results when the weather or climate phenomena in question can be easily conceived of as a discrete binary "event" (i.e., the entirety of the event either occurs or it does not). We show that the IFAR calculation can produce misleading results when the weather or climate phenomena in question are on a continuum, and ACC can be thought of as altering the intensity of the geophysical value that is used in the eventhood definition. Specifically, we show that the IFAR calculation inflates the impacts associated with ACC in these circumstances because it inaccurately assumes that there would have been zero impact had the geophysical value chosen to define eventhood not been exceeded. We illustrate that for weather and climate phenomena on a continuum (e.g., floods, droughts, temperatures, etc.), a clearer way of conceptualizing the impacts associated with ACC is to compare the expected value of the impact between the ACC and preindustrial conditions across the full continuum.

Investigating potential future changes in surface water flooding hazard and impact	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						climate change; hazard; impact; modelling; pluvial flooding; surface water flooding	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLUVIAL FLOOD; MODEL; RISK	Surface water flooding (SWF) is a recurrent hazard that affects lives and livelihoods. Climate change is projected to change the frequency of extreme rainfall events that can lead to SWF. Increasingly, data from Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are being used to investigate the potential water-related impacts of climate change; such assessments often focus on broad-scale fluvial flooding and the use of coarse resolution (>12 km) RCMs. However, high-resolution (<4 km) convection-permitting RCMs are now becoming available that allow impact assessments of more localised SWF to be made. At the same time, there has been an increasing demand for more robust and timely real-time forecast and alert information on SWF. In the UK, a real-time SWF Hazard Impact Model framework has been developed. The system uses 1-km gridded surface runoff estimates from a hydrological model to simulate the SWF hazard. These are linked to detailed inundation model outputs through an Impact Library to assess impacts on property, people, transport, and infrastructure for four severity levels. Here, a set of high-resolution (1.5 km and 12 km) RCM data has been used as input to a grid-based hydrological model over southern Britain to simulate Current (1996-2009) and Future (similar to 2100s; RCP8.5) surface runoff. Counts of threshold-exceedance for surface runoff and precipitation (at 1-, 3- and 6-hr durations) are analysed. Results show that the percentage increases in surface runoff extremes, are less than those of precipitation extremes. The higher-resolution RCM simulates the largest percentage increases, which occur in winter, and the winter exceedance counts are greater than summer exceedance counts. For property impacts, the largest percentage increases are also in winter; however, it is the 12-km RCM output that leads to the largest percentage increase in impacts. The added-value of high-resolution climate model data for hydrological modelling is from capturing the more intense convective storms in surface runoff estimates.

For both demersal fish species, concentrations of Hg, Fe, Cd, Pb, Se, Al, Zn, Cu, Sr, B, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ba, and Li were compared between samples taken from Turkeli, Sinop, Black Sea, before and after the flood event in August 2021. Hg, Mn, Se, Li, B, and Sr metal concentrations increased in whiting and in red mullet in the post-flood samples. Estimated daily intake, target hazard quotient, cancer risk, the maximum allowable daily consumption rate and minimum daily requirements, and health risk analyses indicated that daily consumption of whiting and red mullet was risky due to the heavy metal Hg level after the flood. In addition, it was found that the samples had higher levels of Se than Hg, Se/Hg ratios were above 1, and Se-HBV were positive. Therefore, whiting and red mullet fishing should be restricted for a limited time period in the region.

There is an urgency for adopting Comprehensive Disaster and Climate Risk Management (CRM). In 2016, a group of Peruvian universities established a network (Gestion Integral del Riesgo de Desastres y Adaptacion al Cambio Climatico (GIRD-ACC)) committed to the principles of CRM. This article compiles and evaluates the network results/plans and actions. A qualitative study and a methodological strategy are reported featuring: a bibliographic/network documentary review; an account of the events that led to the start and development of the network; and a case study of a three-university network. Results show that the network can help in deepening knowledge and forging a culture of risk prevention. This is by incorporating risk management and climate change awareness in professional training and intensive activity to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs -11, 13, and 17). Results indicate the importance of gaining consensus (a notoriously difficult task in LA) between the authorities and the operational departments; the role of universities' social responsibilities; incorporating sustainability and risk management themes in the mainstream curricula; and developing a network by learning from similar groupings across LA to improve CRM within universities.

Extreme events caused by climate change, such as heat waves, flooding, and droughts are increasingly frequent and dangerous and the quality of life in cities is progressively decreasing. The building sector is among the most energy intensive sectors and mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed to reduce the emissions and impacts of climate change. This article presents a literature review created using the SCOPUS database on 515 articles setup to investigate the role of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in architectural and urban design processes and to understand how KPIs can be used to improve sustainability in the design of buildings and cities. Findings from the literature review highlights the potentiality of KPIs as a tool for managing complexity and for measure performances starting from the early design stages up to the lifetime of buildings and, in general, design. In parallel, the analysis of results showed that KPIs are commonly used to evaluate performance at a very different scale, but the building scale is the most considered. The use of KPIs in architecture, focusing on sustainability, should be implemented more in the future to allow for a better control of architectural performances.

This study developed a novel method to evaluate future flood inundation risk in the Kakehashi River basin, Japan. First, a pseudo global warming (PGW) method and ensemble simulation techniques were combined to develop rainfall projections with different return periods, based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Second, runoff analyses were performed for the target river basin, and inundation simulations, including levee breaches, were conducted at high spatial resolution (40 x 40 m). Finally, the potential inundation risk for the river basin was estimated. Rainfall simulation results indicated intensification of short-duration heavy rainfall events. The PGW ensemble simulations indicated that extreme rainfall scenarios with long return periods (>1000 years, based on current conditions) are likely to occur more frequently in the future, highlighting the possibility of flood intensification. Regardless of the length of return period, areas with infrequent flooding but large inundation depth and those with more frequent flooding but small inundation depth were classified as high risk. The proposed method provides a baseline framework for future flood risk assessments and the results highlight the importance of incorporating (currently) rare heavy rainfall events in future flood management evaluation and planning.

Currently, thousands of dams worldwide, varying in use, age, and maintenance, may represent a threat to downstream cities in the case of structural failure. Several studies relate the failure of dams to several issues in the spillway, which may be even more vulnerable in CC conditions. This study provides a review of dam safety threats due to CC and approaches for the design/redesign of the spillway to cope with CC. A general four-stage methodology is proposed: data gathering and hydro-climatic, hydrological, and hydraulic analyses. Afterward, this methodology is applied to the spillway design for the Sube y Baja dam in Ecuador. The Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) increases around 20% considering CC under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Such an increment derived a 25% increase in the spillway maximum flow. These results show that the non-stationary hydrological regimes related to CC require a revision of engineering design criteria for hydraulic structures in general, and call for a consensus on design variables under CC.

Floods are one of the most challenging issues to address to reduce damages and losses in urban areas. Building resilience through adaptation to these changing conditions has become a common goal for different disciplines involving planning for the future. Adaptation planning is widely recognized as generally applicable to any field. However, there are current limitations to overcome for architectural and urban planning to switch from theory to practice. This paper proposes a critical overview of literature works on flood mitigative strategies and adaptive approaches considering uncertainties, linking strategies for the Built Environment (BE) to mitigate the effects of floods, and operative frameworks to pursue adaptation under changing environmental conditions. The literature selection accounts for the pivotal components of the BE: open spaces (OSs), buildings, and users. Next, we provide an overview of the most relevant adaptive methodologies that have emerged in literature, and, lastly, the planning strategies are discussed, considering the climate-related uncertainties that might undermine the effectiveness of the designed action. The present paper aimed to provide a contribution to the discussion regarding the necessity of making architectural and urban planning adaptive, providing a base for future studies for operative adaptation.

J	Bossio, CF; Ford, J; Labbé, D				Bossio, Camila Florez; Ford, James; Labbe, Danielle			Adaptive capacity in urban areas of developing countries	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; FLOOD RISK; CHANGE VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; GLOBAL CLIMATE; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; RESPONSES; IMPACTS	Urban areas of developing countries face increasing risks due to climate change. This paper systematically identifies and examines research published between 2000 and 2017 that assesses urban adaptive capacity to climate change in developing countries. To critically examine this literature, we developed a conceptual framework of urban adaptive capacity. The framework focuses on key components of urban adaptive capacity in three dimensions: the characterization of adaptive capacity, the external factors mediating adaptive capacity, and the dynamics of adaptive capacity. The study sheds light on the spatial and scalar interactions of individuals, communities, and authorities' adaptive capacities within urban areas and highlights the importance of governance and social institutions in shaping urban adaptive capacity. The work also finds shortcomings in the current assessment of urban adaptive capacity, with key gaps including a narrow focus on the range and types of adaptive capacity; limited assessment of the multilevel determinants, place-based processes, and urban determinants that shape adaptive capacity; and a lack of consideration of adaptive capacity interactions between social entities and with regard to climate sensitivity and exposure of a given area, including the potential for maladaptation. Addressing these research gaps would contribute to generate knowledge that can adequately support adaptation planning of urban areas in developing countries.

J	Rashiq, A; Prakash, O				Rashiq, Ahmad; Prakash, Om			Assessment of Spatio-temporal variability of climate in the lower Gangetic alluvial plain	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Lower Gangetic plain; Rainfall variability; Spatio-temporal seasonal shift		Global climate change is a cause of concern as extreme events have intensified in recent years, with increased floods and droughts also reported in the Lower Gangetic Plain (LGP). Assessments from Regional Climatic Models (RCM) cannot capture the local climate variability necessary for devising an action plan for climate risk mitigation. The present study aims to fill this gap by assessing the long-term local-scale climate variability using Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) and Centroidal Day (CD) shifts for the Patna district, which can be extended to other districts in the LGP. The time series is split into two halves to account for changes due to urbanization in recent three to four decades. CD analysis shows a forward shift in the monsoonal and annual rainfall in recent decades. The variability in total rainfall has become more pronounced post-1985 during monsoon, postmonsoon, and winter seasons. An increase of 64.53 mm (18.9%) in surface runoff and a strong correlation between built-up area and precipitation further cement the role of urbanization in local climate change. Despite a 5.74% decrease in monsoonal rainfall, a 3.51 mm/day increase in rainfall intensity is observed during the monsoon. The implications of these variabilities have posed new challenges for the agricultural production and management of water resources and the interactions between groundwater and surface runoff.

This study is conducted to assess the impact of climate change on PMF in a tropical catchment. Climate and inflow data of the Tenmengor reservoir, located in the state of Perak in Malaysia, have been used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model. The projected rainfall from regional climate model is used to generate probable maximum precipitation (PMP) for future periods. A hydrological model was used to simulate PMF from PMP estimated for the historical and two future periods, early (2031 - 2045) and late (2060 - 2075). The results revealed good performance of the hydrological model with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, 0.74, and the relative standard error, 0.51, during validation. The estimated rainfall depths were 89.5 mm, 106.3 mm, and 143.3 mm, respectively, for 5, 10, and 50 years of the return period. The study indicated an increase in PMP by 162% to 507% and 259% to 487% during early and late periods for different return periods ranging from 5 to 1000 years. This would cause an increase in PMF by 48.9% and 122.6% during early and late periods. A large increase in PMF indicates the possibility of devastating floods in the future in his tropical catchment due to climate change.

This study uses five CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) to drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, and then simulates the hydrological response of the upper and middle Huaihe River Basin (UMHRB) under future shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSPs). The results show that the five-GCM ensemble improves the simulation accuracy compared to a single model. The climate over the UMHRB likely becomes warmer. The general trend of future precipitation is projected to increase, and the increased rates are higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Changes in annual evapotranspiration are basically consistent with precipitation, but seasonal evapotranspiration shows different changes (0-18%). The average annual runoff will increase in a wavelike manner, and the change patterns of runoff follow that of seasonal precipitation. Changes in soil moisture are not obvious, and the annual soil moisture increases slightly. In the intrayear process, soil moisture decreases slightly in autumn. The research results will enhance a more realistic understanding of the future hydrological response of the UMHRB and assist decision-makers in developing watershed flood risk-management measures and water and soil conservation plans.

Among the various risks and disasters, floods are the most frequent hazard that makes haor households vulnerable. Therefore, this study was undertaken to estimate livelihood vulnerability to flooding within the flood-prone haor ecosystem in Bangladesh. Primary data were collected from 100 haor households each from Kishoreganj, Netrokona, and Sunamganj districts (N = 300) by applying a multistage random sampling technique. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework of vulnerability were applied to compare vulnerabilities among the selected haor-based communities. The empirical results revealed that haor households in Sunamganj district were more vulnerable to flood hazard and natural disaster in terms of food, water, and health than households in the other two districts. Taking into account the major components of the LVI, the IPCC framework of vulnerability indicated that households in Sunamganj district were the most vulnerable due to their lowest adaptive capacity and highest sensitivity and exposure. These findings enable policymakers to formulate and implement effective strategies and programs to minimize vulnerability and enhance resilience by improving the livelihoods of the vulnerable haor households of Bangladesh, especially those in Sunamganj district.

They have become prominent policy tools used to address coastal squeeze of intertidal habitats occurring from sea-level rise and 'hold-the-line' management approaches. This policy development is evaluated against scientific evidence and its broader ethical dimensions regarding conservation of the natural environment. A case study is provided from the UK (England) where the National Habitat Compensation Programme aims to continue conservation obligations consistent with the EU Habitats Directive and Natura 2000. Progress is also referenced against Shoreline Management Plans and aspirations for a greater proportion of the coast to shift to managed realignment in response to sea level rise. Important barriers are identified, and issues of monitoring, transparency, and robustness are highlighted regarding habitat compensation and general coastal policy. At present, habitat compensation is based upon a simple area-based balance sheet approach which overlooks key uncertainties and gives a misleading indication of progress. Climate change adaptation planning needs to include more flexibility based upon alternative scenarios and response pathways, especially regarding recent evidence for higher future sea-level rises. Robust responses also require more emphasis on improved interpretation of ecological functioning, integrity, and coherence, as essential concepts to facilitate ecosystem based adaptation consistent with international conventions and application of the precautionary principle.

Study focus: This paper aims at quantifying the flow regime alterations in the entire Mekong from 1980 to 2015 and linking with the controlling drivers of alterations. In this regard, various indicators, analytical methods, and a semi two-dimensional hydrodynamic and advectiondispersion model were used. New hydrological insights for the region: The flow regime alterations in the high-dam development period (2009-2015) are more pronounced than in the low-dam development period (1993-2008), compared to the no-dam development period (1980-1992), based on most of the indicators analyzed. In the high-dam development period all existing dams with large reservoir capacity seemed to have cumulatively reduced the flood pulses and frequency and increased the low-flow discharge along the entire Mekong through reservoir operations, exceeding climate change effect. In the recent years the water levels in the low-flow season in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) have decreased, possibly because of increased riverbed incision caused by reduced sediment supply and increased sand mining. The reduced water levels together with the increased number of the sluice gates constructed seemed to have increased salinity intrusion in the VMD which may be partly reduced by early emergency water release from upstream dams.

The problem is expected to worsen with climate change, particularly in coastal megacities of developing nations (CMDN), where vulnerability to extreme weather events is high and flood management capacity is weak. This systematic literature review focuses on structural approaches to flood management in CMDN as most of these cities rely heavily on them. The review covers the last two decades, being the period 1998-2018. Results reveal key areas of research, which are discussed within two broad categories of focus (1) establishment of new flood control projects and (2) management of existing flood control infrastructure. Several directions are suggested to guide future research efforts.

The Jilin Momoge National Nature Reserve, which consists of large areas of marshes, is located in the semi-arid region of northeast China and is an important stopover site for the critically endangered species of the Siberian Crane (Grus leucogeranus). Global climate change, extreme droughts and floods, and large differences in evaporation and precipitation in this region can cause rapid vegetation succession. In recent years, increased grain production and river-lake connectivity projects carried out in this area to increase grain outputs and restore wetlands have caused significant changes in the hydrological and landscape patterns. Therefore, research on the response of variation trends in vegetation patterns to the main driving factors (climate change and human activities) is critical for the conservation of the Siberian Crane. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we obtained and processed the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the study area during the peak summer vegetation period for each year from 1984 to 2020, estimated the annual vegetation cover using Maximum value composites (MVC) method and the image dichotomy method, calculated and analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of vegetation cover, explored the response of vegetation cover change in terms of climate change and human activities, and quantified the relative contribution of both. The results revealed that first, from the spatial and temporal changes, the average annual growth rate of regional vegetation was 0.002/a, and 71.14% of the study area was improved. The vegetation cover showed a trend of degradation and then recovery, in which the percentage of high vegetation cover area decreased from 51.22% (1984-2000) to 28.33% (2001-2005), and then recovered to 55.69% (2006-2020). Second, among climate change factors, precipitation was more correlated with the growth of vegetation in the study area than temperature, and the increase in precipitation during the growing season could promote the growth of marsh vegetation in the Momoge Reserve. Third, overall, human activities have contributed to the improvement of vegetation cover in the study area with the implementation of important ecological projects, such as the return of farmland to wetlands, the return of grazing to grass, and the connection of rivers and lakes. Fourth, climate change and human activities jointly drive vegetation change, but the contribution of human activities in both vegetation improvement and degradation areas (85.68% and 78.29%, respectively) is higher than that of climate change (14.32% and 21.71%, respectively), which is the main reason for vegetation improvement or degradation in the study area. The analysis of vegetation pattern change within an intensive time series in semi-arid regions can provide a reference and basis for studying the driving factors in regions with rapid changes in vegetation and hydrological conditions.

The Safe Development Paradox in Flood Risk Management: A Critical Review	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						safe development paradox; flood risk; flood risk management; structural flood protection; spatial planning; climate change	HURRICANE-KATRINA; SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION; ADAPTATION; LESSONS; LOSSES; TIME	Climate change and continued urban development in flood-prone areas exacerbate flood risks. Flood Risk Management authorities often turn to structural protection measures to minimise losses. However, these measures often lead to infrastructural lock-ins with potential unintended consequences as increased safety can induce increased development, ultimately leading to higher losses in the event of failures of the structural safe-guards in place. This process has been referred to as the Safe Development Paradox: a cross-cutting science-policy-practice challenge that requires a systematic understanding in the context of climate change and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, there are no comprehensive review studies, to date, that summarize the state of knowledge of the Safe Development Paradox. This paper provides the first evidence base through a critical review of the state-of-the-art and quantitative analysis of the peer-reviewed English-language literature since 2000, highlighting key knowledge gaps and issues hindering progress in addressing the Safe Development Paradox. It was identified that current research is compounded by a lack of consistent terminology, limited geographic distribution of case studies, and skewed emphasis on fluvial flooding. The review ends with potential directions across the science, policy, and practice domains for increasing knowledge and tackling the Safe Development Paradox.

J	Bromhead, H				Bromhead, Helen			Tensions in talking about disasters: Habitual versus climate-informed - The case of bushfire vocabulary in Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Climate change; semantically-enhanced discourse studies; natural semantic metalanguage (NSM); Australian English; extreme weather discourse	QUEENSLAND; DISCOURSE	Disasters occasion ways of speaking and writing in the societies in which they take place. Now, due to climate change, events such as wildfires, floods and heatwaves are becoming more severe and more frequent. Therefore, the climate crisis poses a challenge, not only materially, but discursively. Habitual vocabulary may no longer be appropriate, and there is a pull between these turns of phrase and newer ones informed by climate change. The article takes the case of Australia whose public discourse in English about 'bushfires' has been characterized by traditional vocabulary, focused on battling the elements. Through three examples, the study treats tensions between the habitual and the climate-informed in event names (e.g. Black Summer), a social category (volunteer firefighters) and a construction of political critique (I don't hold a hose). The frame taken is semantically-enhanced discourse studies, inspired by natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) and other cultural takes. A transtextual approach is used, along with research from humanities and social science. The study finds that through the interplay between habitual and climate-informed vocabulary about 'bushfires', one can view conceptions of events, cultures, social relations, identities and relationships to places in Australia. Extreme weather formations and climate change formations cannot be easily separated.

The modelling toolbox used includes a large-scale wave propagation model, a storm-induced circulation model, and an advanced nearshore wave propagation model based on the higher order Boussinesq-type equations, all of which are presented in detail. Model capabilities are validated and applications are made for projected scenarios of climate change-induced wave and storm surge events, simulating coastal flooding over the low-lying areas of a semi-enclosed bay and testing the effects of different structures on a typical sandy beach (both in northern Greece). This work is among the few in relevant literature that incorporate a fully non-linear wave model to a modelling system aimed at representing coastal flooding. Results highlight the capabilities of the presented modelling approach and set the basis for a comprehensive evaluation of the use of advanced modelling tools for the design of coastal protection and adaptation measures against future climatic pressures.

J	McDonnell, S				McDonnell, Siobhan			The importance of attention to customary tenure solutions: slow onset risks and the limits of Vanuatu's climate change and resettlement policy	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; LAND; DAMAGE; WANT	The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate suggests sea level rise may be best understood as a slow onset disaster for Pacific Island countries and, in particular, low lying atoll nations. Sea-level rise, coastal flooding and surge inundation is an increasingly pressing problem across the urban Pacific. This paper begins with a discussion of how issues such as sea level rise and forced relocation are addressed within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations (UNFCCC) and, specifically in the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM). Beyond the material impacts, what is even more important for Pacific people in the context of long-term climate induced displacement are the noneconomic losses associated with the loss of human life, cultural connection and loosing connection to their ancestral land and places of belonging. In this context, the Vanuatu government have recently developed a climate change and resettlement policy which supposedly offers three broad state-oriented and human rights-based durable solutions to resettlement. However in Vanuatu, like elsewhere in the Pacific, the overwhelming majority of land is held under customary tenure arrangements. An alternative, and arguably more effective approach, to resettlement solutions may be to negotiate arrangements through customary institutions rather than the state.

In this paper, we argue that attempts to mitigate this process through a focus on individualised risk communication and behavioural change are unlikely to be successful, given the epistemic conflicts surrounding climate change knowledges in public discourse. In response, we argue for an alternative framework for developing environmental knowledges, using social learning to promote both epistemic realignment and a re-scaling of environmental governance that promotes enablement. We use insights from research on flooding in South West England to highlight the ways in which traditional policy approaches such as behavioural change have come to be so overbearing in public debate on environmental hazards management. In contrast, we demonstrate the potential for a re-scaling of environmental governance to reconfigure climate change knowledge and build new spaces for enablement to reduce hazard vulnerability at the place-based community scale. We argue that this has major epistemological and practical implications for the ways that researchers and policy makers work with publics to reduce hazard risk under a changing climate.

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of streamflow extremes (QE) and sediment load extremes (SE) in the Yellow River (YR) during 1956-2019. Furthermore, the effects of main human activities and climate change were identified by establishing quantitative relationships between these factors and changing hydrological extremes. Specifically, the QE and SE have decreased significantly (p < 0.05) since 1956 except the headwater (reach above Tangnaihai). However, the QE increased significantly (p < 0.05) during 2000-2019 due to increased extreme precipitation, while the SE tended to stabilize at most stations. Besides, the contribution of QE to annual streamflow declined distinctly in the upper-middle reaches (Lanzhou-Tongguan reach) but increased signifi-cantly in the lower reaches (reach below Huayuankou). Likewise, the contribution of SE to annual sediment load increased remarkably in the middle-lower reaches (Huayuankou-Lijin reach). Furthermore, the timing of QE and SE generally tended to disperse from the flood season to the four seasons. While extreme precipitation funda-mentally caused the extreme water and sediment discharge, the magnitude and hazard of QE and SE can be strongly regulated by human activities. Particularly, mainstream dams can artificially regulate QE and SE magnitudes and relationships and reduce their synchronization probability, and intra-basin engineering con-struction and revegetation measures can substantially reduce their possible peaks in a power function form. In addition, changes in the extreme water-sediment relationships indicated that declining erosive power in the middle reaches and decreasing sediment availability in the lower reaches dominated SE reduction. This study provides a scientific basis for flood risk management and water resources development and utilization in large complex river basins.

J	Raj, R; Sofi, AA				Raj, Renjith; Sofi, Arfat Ahmad			Does climate change leads to severe household-level vulnerability? Evidence from the Western Ghats of Kerala, India	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Occupational categories; Household level vulnerability; Adaptive capacity entitlement; Western Ghats of Kerala	INHERENT VULNERABILITY; ENTITLEMENTS	Due to climate change, erratic and extreme rainfall events are rising in Kerala, India. This, in turn, is triggering landslides and floods in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Accordingly, this study analyzes the assessment and distribution of household level vulnerability toward climate change among the occupational categories in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Based on landslide data of Kerala for the years 2018 and 2019, five villages from the Idukki district of Kerala that accounts for the highest number of landslides are selected as the study region. The landslides and floods have either entirely or partially destroyed 3367 households in the study region during 2018 and 2019. Among these, 348 families are chosen for the study. We have adopted a stratified random sampling technique. The households belonging to all occupational categories are included in the sample. To facilitate the analysis, we have developed the concept of adaptive capacity entitlement to analyze the household-level vulnerability differences among occupational categories. Accordingly, data is elicited using an interview schedule and analyzed using robust logistic regression models. The results show that agrarian households are significantly vulnerable to landslides and floods. Among agrarian households, agricultural laborers tend to be the most vulnerable. A substantial number of agricultural laborer households live in hazard-prone regions, resulting in unequally distributed exposure to climatic hazards. The study reveals that the family's historic wealth (landholding) plays a significant role in households' capacity to attain entitlement. Besides, the entitlement enables the household to migrate to safer locations. The study highlights the need to frame a holistic climate adaptation policy for the region. For this reason, a sustainable land use policy has to be developed. Consequently, we recommend further studies to analyze the prospects and challenges of rehabilitation as well as land use regulation policies.

During the March-April-May (MAM) rainfall season of 2012, 2016 and 2018, Kenya experienced high rainfall that caused both widespread and localised flooding, resulting in human and livestock deaths, destruction of infrastructure and property, bursting of riverbanks, submerging of farmlands and emergence of isolated cases of water-borne diseases. Here, we aim to quantify how the magnitude of heavy rainfall during these seasons may have been altered by human-induced climate change. We undertake a probabilistic attribution analysis using three different approaches utilising two observational datasets and two independent climate model experiment set-ups. We analyse three different seasonal heavy rainfall indices, maximum consecutive 5day, 10-day, and 20-day rainfall, to compare the magnitude of maxima recorded in MAM 2012, 2016 and 2018 with the magnitude of maxima in a pre-industrial climate (with little or no anthropogenic influence). We find a shift towards intensification of extreme rainfall in today's climate, although these increases are not in all cases statistically distinguishable from our estimates of magnitudes in the preindustrial climate. Although we find no significant anthropogenic climate change influence, the intensification of extreme rainfall amid the observed drying trend and the projected increases in rainfall in the MAM season in Kenya, leave the already vulnerable societies with uncertainties about how to prepare for a changing climate. This study, therefore, provides a basis for an in-depth assessment of current and future trends of extreme rainfall in East Africa in adapting to changing climate risks for sustainable development in the already vulnerable and less resilient society.

J	Ishii, Y				Ishii, Yuji			Luminescence dating reveals a rapid response to climate change of fluvial terrace formation along the Ani River, northeastern Japan, during the last glacial period	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY			English	Article						Fluvial terrace; IRSL dating; Pulsed IRSL dating; Last glacial period; Climate change; Japan	FADING CORRECTION; ASIAN MONSOON; IRSL; FELDSPAR; DEPOSITS; PALEOCLIMATE; FLOODPLAIN; EVOLUTION; LOWLAND; GRAINS	Fluvial terraces along the middle reaches of many Japanese rivers were formed during the last glacial period as a result of changes in sediment discharge related to cooler temperatures and/or reduced water discharge because of lower precipitation. The influence of climate change on these fluvial terraces is not yet fully understood because most previous studies lacked detailed reconstructions of the chronology of terrace development. This study provides a detailed luminescence chronology of fluvial terrace deposits along the Ani River, northeastern Honshu, Japan, and compares that chronology to paleoclimatic records. Eight samples for luminescence dating were obtained from an outcrop of terrace deposits (~10 m thick) in the Ani River valley. The fading-corrected infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) ages are consistent with the fading-corrected post-IR IRSL ages for some samples, which suggests that fading corrections were effective despite the higher fading rates of the IRSL signal. However, for the other samples, the post-IR IRSL ages are significantly older than the fading-corrected IRSL ages due to incomplete bleaching. The pulsed IRSL signals are close to field saturation for older samples, which might have resulted in a greater variation of the ages. Fading-corrected IRSL ages demonstrate periods of rapid aggradation during 105-90 ka and 75-60 ka. Comparison of terrace development with paleoclimatic records indicates that the two periods of fluvial deposition correspond to decreases in precipitation caused by weakened East Asian summer monsoon precipitation and possibly decreases in temperature. The results of this study show that the Ani River responded rapidly to climate change on a time scale of a few tens of thousands of years during the last glacial period.

This study took tropical cyclones-extreme precipitation-flash floods as an example to carry out a risk assessment of flash floods under climate change in the Yantanxi River Basin, southeastern China. To obtain the flash flood inundation characteristics through hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling, the study combined representative concentration pathway (RCP) and shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios to examine the change of flash flood risk and used the geographical detector to explore the driving factors behind the change. The results show that flash flood risk in the Yantanxi River Basin will significantly increase, and that socioeconomic factors and precipitation are the main driving forces. Under the RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5 scenarios, the risk of flash floods is expected to increase by 88.79% and 95.57%, respectively. The main drivers in the case study area are GDP density (q = 0.85), process rainfall (q = 0.74), asset density (q = 0.68), and population density (q = 0.67). The study highlights the influence of socioeconomic factors on the change of flash flood disaster risk in small river basins. Our findings also provide a reference for regional planning and construction of flood control facilities in flash flood-prone areas, which may help to reduce the risk of flash floods.

Hard coastal defences play a key role in protecting at-risk urban coastal populations from flooding and erosion, but coastal ecosystems also play important roles in the overall sustainability and resilience of cities and urban centres by contributing to coastal protection. Conserving coastal ecosystems and maximising their resilience will ensure that urban coastal communities can continue to benefit from ecosystem services and improve their adaptive capacity to cope with adverse impacts in the future. Using the hyper-urbanised coast of Singapore as a case study, we modelled the resilience of coastal wetlands to SLR and integrated resilience in conservation plan-ning. We found that the responses of coastal habitats to rising sea level vary across the modelling periods. While there is a slight net gain in the extent of mangrove forests and tidal flats by the end of the century due to potential habitat conversion, the existing habitats will experience a loss in coverage. Highly modified coastlines associated with urbanisation impede the ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward, which is a key mechanism for coastal habitats to cope with rising sea levels. Systematic conservation planning can identify sites that are potentially resilient to SLR and incorporate factors that influence an ecosystem's capability to respond to change. Crucially, the relatively slow rates of SLR and persistence of coastal wetlands during the earlier half of this century present an opportunity to introduce management interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.

They provide numerous ecosystem services (ES), but their supply may be negatively affected by agricultural management. We conducted a literature review to identify which ES are supplied by kettle holes and to analyze feedbacks with agricultural management. Taking Germany as a test case, we also analyzed how kettle holes are addressed in policy documents and for which ES they are regulated. This was done to identify the societal value officially associated with kettle holes. The literature review found eight ES attributed to kettle holes, of which hydrological cycle and flood control, chemical condition of freshwaters, nursery populations and habitats and biotic remediation of wastes were addressed most often. In contrast, only the provision of habitat service was addressed in German policy documents related to kettle holes. We identified types of agricultural management that negatively affected the supply of ES by kettle holes, in particular artificial drainage, high levels of pesticide and fertilizer application, and management where tillage and erosion result in elevated sediment inputs. Additionally, climate change may lead to an increased drying up of kettle holes. Based on our finding, we conclude that the intensity of agricultural management around kettle holes threatens the supply of all ES while only the service of providing habitats for biodiversity is addressed in German policy regulations. Further regulation is required to induce agricultural management change towards a conservation of all ES supplied by kettle holes.

Therefore, we collected gauged river flow time series from 1961 to 2018 from across Sweden for 34 disturbed catchments to quantify how the various types of disturbances have affected river flow. We used trend analysis and the differences in observations versus hydrological modeling to explore the effects on river flow from (1) land cover changes from wildfires, storms, and urbanization; (2) dam constructions with regulations for hydropower production; and (3) climate-change impact in otherwise undisturbed catchments. A mini model ensemble, consisting of three versions of the S-HYPE model, was used, and the three models gave similar results. We searched for changes in annual and daily stream flow, seasonal flow regime, and flow duration curves. The results show that regulation of river flow has the largest impact, reducing spring floods with up to 100% and increasing winter flow by several orders of magnitude, with substantial effects transmitted far downstream. Climate changed the total river flow up to 20%. Tree removal by wildfires and storms has minor impacts at medium and large scales. Urbanization, on the contrary, showed a 20% increase in high flows also at medium scales. This study emphasizes the benefits of combining observed time series with numerical modeling to exclude the effect of varying weather conditions, when quantifying the effects of various drivers on long-term streamflow shifts.

Conservation implications of ecological responses to extreme weather and climate events	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Review						adaptation plan; climate change; cyclone; drought; impact; vulnerability assessment	EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; SPECIES VULNERABILITY; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; PROLONGED DROUGHT; REGIME SHIFTS; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY; RAIN; IMPACTS; DISTURBANCES	Aim Many conservation efforts now focus on mitigating biodiversity loss due to climate change. While a focus on impacts from mean, long-term changes in climate is warranted, the vast majority of conservation plans largely ignore another key factor of climate change-changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events. A typology of the full range and severity of ecological responses to extreme events would help underpin tracking of their impacts. Location Global. Methods Here, we review 519 observational studies of ecological responses to extreme events between 1941 and 2015. We include responses from amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, mammals, plants and reptiles to cyclones, drought, flood, cold waves and heat waves. Results Negative ecological responses were the most commonly reported, accounting for 57% of all documented responses. There were over 100 cases of a >25% population decline and 31 cases of local extirpation. Sixty per cent of the studies in our review observed ecological responses for more than 1 year, and of the studies that monitored species or ecosystem recovery following exposure to an extreme event, 38% showed species or ecosystems did not recover to pre-disturbance levels. Main conclusions Extreme weather and climate events have profound implications for species and ecosystem management. We discuss current conceptual challenges associated with incorporating extreme events into conservation planning efforts, which include how to quantify species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to extreme events, how to account for interactions between extreme events and other stressors, and how to maximize adaptive capacity to more frequent and intense extreme events.

First, attributing migration to climate change misreads coastal vulnerabilities and the importance of migration as a gendered livelihood strategy to deal with rural precarity and debt- both in the past and present. Second, misreading migration caused by brackish tiger-prawn cultivation, infrastructure-related waterlogging and riverbank erosion as 'climate-induced' hinders a discussion of long-term solutions for rural underemployment, salinisation, siltation and land loss. Lastly, framing climate change as causing 'gendered displacement' ignores the importance of affective kinship migration in shaping single women's migration choices.

A buried river, an emerging crisis, a cumulative tale	RETHINKING HISTORY			English	Article						Cambridge; MA; Somerville; MA; Boston; MA; climate change; river burial; Miller's river; environmental memory		As climate change alters our cities, a better knowledge of past environments is necessary to understand current flooding patterns and anticipate future ones. This cumulative tale is a narrative riff on the comparison between history and archaeology, that each dig into layers of time and soil, respectively. By starting at the surface of a present-day flooding issue and digging into both the landscape and historic sources, the cumulative tale relates the burial of Miller's River, once the boundary between Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts. This article explains how a repeatedly forgotten river and its altered environs complicate current and future life in the greater Boston metro area and points to many other buried waterways that pose similar problems.

Understanding their hydrological processes in the context of future climate change and land use scenarios is important for water resource management. This study investigated hydrological processes and their driving factors and eco-hydrological impacts for these two geographical units in the Xitiaoxi watershed, East China, and quantified their differences through hydrological modelling. Hydrological processes in 24 mountain watersheds and 143 lowland watersheds were simulated based on a raster-based Xin'anjiang model and a Nitrogen Dynamic Polder (NDP) model, respectively. These two models were calibrated and validated with an acceptable performance (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0.81 and 0.50, respectively) for simulating discharge for mountain watersheds and water level for lowland watersheds. Then, an Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) model was used to help quantify the alterations to the hydrological process and their resulting eco-hydrological impacts. Based on the validated models, scenario analysis was conducted to evaluate the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydrological processes. The simulation results revealed that (a) climate change would cause a larger increase in annual runoff than that under land use scenario in the mountain watersheds, with variations of 19.9 and 10.5% for the 2050s, respectively. (b) Land use change was more responsible for the streamflow increment than climate change in the lowland watersheds, causing an annual runoff to increase by 27.4 and 16.2% for the 2050s, respectively. (c) Land use can enhance the response of streamflow to the climatic variation. (d) The above-mentioned hydrological variations were notable in flood and dry season in the mountain watersheds, and they were significant in rice season in the lowland watersheds. (e) Their resulting degradation of ecological diversity was more susceptible to future climate change in the two watersheds. This study demonstrated that mountain and lowland watersheds showed distinct differences in hydrological processes and their responses to climate and land use changes.

Climate change-induced risks and interventions to reduce these risks do not only impact urban risk management systems and infrastructures, but also people's daily lives. In order to build public support for climate adaptation and resilience-building and stimulate collaboration between authorities and citizens, it is necessary that adaptation and resilience-building are locally meaningful. Thus, interventions should be rooted in citizens' concerns and aspirations for their city. Urban policymakers and researchers have started the search for better citizen participation in adaptation. However, tools to connect the relatively strategic and long-term notions of adaptation to a gradually changing climate held by planners and scientists with how citizens experience today's climate and weather remain elusive. This paper investigates the use of 'narratives of change' as an approach to elicit perceptions of past, present and future weather, water, and climate, and how these relate to citizens' desired futures. We tested this by eliciting and comparing narratives of change from authorities and from citizens in the Dutch city of Dordrecht. Our analysis of the process showed that historical events, embedded in local memory and identity, have a surprisingly strong impact on how climate change is perceived and acted upon today. This contributes to an awareness and sense of urgency of some climate risks (e.g. flood risks). However, it also shifts attention away from other risks (e.g. intensified heat stress). The analysis highlighted commonalities, like shared concerns about climate change and desires to collaborate, but also differences in how climate change, impacts, and action are conceptualized. There are possibilities for collaboration and mutual learning, as well as areas of potential disagreement and conflict. We conclude that narratives are a useful tool to better connect the governance of climate adaptation with peoples' daily experience of climate risks and climate resilience, thereby potentially increasing public support for and participation in resilience-building.

This vulnerability will often be exacerbated by changing rainfall and storm patterns due to climate change. Using the principles of urban biomimicry, this study aims to show an ecosystem service-based approach to designing an urban green infrastructure network for stormwater management in densely built areas that more closely emulates natural hydrology processes. Nature Braid (next-generation LUCI) is an ecosystem services assessment tool that was used to simulate flood mitigation ecosystem services in a 13.7 km(2) urban water catchment in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. The simulation results revealed that 59% of the catchment does not contain or benefit from flood-mitigating land cover features. Adding 0.6 km(2) (4% of the catchment) of green roofs alongside major stormwater flow paths resulted in a nearly three-fold decrease (11%) in the unmitigated flooding area. These results suggest that green roofs could help manage stormwater and mitigate flooding in the densely built areas of the catchment. Using ecosystem service assessment tools, like Nature Braid, can inform the design of more regenerative and resilient urban green infrastructure networks that help mitigate climate change impacts on urban residents.

Despite well-developed repertoires of response, agrarian societies have been 'double exposed' to intensifying climate change and agro-industrialization over the past several decades, often in ways that alter both the regularity of flood events and individual and community capacity for response. This paper engages these tensions by exploring everyday experiences of and responses to extreme flood events in a case study village in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which has also been the site of corporate oil palm development since 2010. We first reconstruct histories of extreme flood events along the Konawe'eha River using oral histories and satellite imagery, describing the role of these events in straining the terms of daily production and reproduction. We then outline the ways smallholder agriculturalists are responding to flood events through alterations in their land use strategies, including through the sale or leasing of flood-prone lands, the relocation of riverine vegetable production to hillside locations, and adoption of new cropping choices and management practices. We highlight the role of such responses as a driver of ongoing land use change, potentially in ways that increase systemic vulnerability to floods moving forward.

An ensemble of five General Circulation Models (GCMs), namely HadGEM2-ES, CanESM2, EC-EARTH, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR dynamically downscaled by two Regional Climate Models (RCMs), specifically HadRM3P and RCA4, was selected to provide an overview of the impacts of different climate change scenarios under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 using the 1961-1990 baseline period. The GR2M hydrological model was used to reproduce the historical monthly surface runoff patterns of each catchment. Following calibration and validation of the GRM2 model, the projected impact of climate change on streamflow was simulated for a near-future (2011-2040), mid-future (2041-2070) and far-future (2071-2100) for each catchment using the bias-corrected GCM-RCM multimodel ensemble-mean (MEM). Results anticipate wetter conditions for all catchments in the near-future and mid-future periods under RCPs 2.6 and 4.5, whereas dryer conditions are expected for the far-future period under RCP 8.5. Projected temperature trends indicate consistently warmer conditions with increasing radiative forcing and future periods. Streamflow changes across all catchments however are dominated by variations in projected precipitation. Wetter conditions for the near-future and mid-future horizons under RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 would result in higher runoff volumes, particularly during the late wet season (LWS). Conversely, dryer conditions for the far-future period under RCP8.5 would result in considerably lower runoff volumes during the early wet season (EWS) and the Mid-Summer Drought (MSD). In consequence, projected seasonal changes on streamflow across all catchments may result in more frequent flooding, droughts, and water supply shortage compared to historical hydrological regimes.

Hydropower production, however, is threatened by human activities that lead to a decrease in water storage capacity of reservoirs. Land use/land cover and climatic changes are driving accelerated soil erosion in semi-arid East Africa, which ultimately increases reservoir sedimentation and decreases energy production. Sediment delivery dynamics at the catchment scale are complex, involving the interaction of multiple factors and processes on different spatial and temporal scales. A lack of understanding of these processes and their interactions may impede the efficiency of sediment mitigation and control strategies. A deep understanding of the processes of erosion and connectivity of the land to river channel, as well as storage of eroded material within hillslopes and floodplains, and sediment accumulation in the reservoirs supports selection of future dam locations and sustainable management of reservoirs. The sediment budget approach can provide such a holistic perspective by accounting for the various sediment sources, transport, sinks, and redistribution when the sediment is routed through that catchment. Constructing sediment budgets is challenging, but the potential for integrating a number of different techniques offers new opportunities to collect the required information. In East Africa, the spatial planning of dams is mainly dominated by political and financial motives, and impacts of land use and climate on the sediment transport dynamics are not adequately considered. Production of sediment budgets under different scenarios of land use and climate change should be an essential step when deciding the location and management strategies for dams. Selection of new hydroelectric reservoir sites must consider long-term scientific data on climate change, and the sediment budget components for sustainable land management planning, hydropower sustainability.

Importance of snow and glacier meltwater for agriculture on the Indo-Gangetic Plain	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER AVAILABILITY; SOUTH-ASIA; FOOD; IRRIGATION; DISCHARGE; PRECIPITATION; VULNERABILITY; CHALLENGE; SECURITY	Densely populated floodplains downstream of Asia's mountain ranges depend heavily on mountain water resources, in particular for irrigation. An intensive and complex multi-cropping irrigated agricultural system has developed here to optimize the use of these mountain water resources in conjunction with monsoonal rainfall. Snow and glacier melt thereby modulate the seasonal pattern of river flows and, together with groundwater, provide water when rainfall is scarce. Climate change is expected to weaken this modulating effect, with potentially strong effects on food production in one of the world's breadbaskets. Here we quantify the space-, time-and crop-specific dependence of agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on mountain water resources, using a coupled state-of-the-art, high-resolution, cryosphere-hydrology-crop model. We show that dependence varies strongly in space and time and is highest in the Indus basin, where in the pre-monsoon season up to 60% of the total irrigation withdrawals originate from mountain snow and glacier melt, and that it contributes an additional 11% to total crop production. Although dependence in the floodplains of the Ganges is comparatively lower, meltwater is still essential during the dry season, in particular for crops such as sugar cane. The dependency on meltwater in the Brahmaputra is negligible. In total, 129 million farmers in the Indus and Ganges substantially depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihoods. Snow and glacier melt provides enough water to grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people. These findings provide important information for agricultural and climate change adaptation policies in a climate change hot spot where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of climate change and socio-economic growth.

J	Hettiarachchi, S; Wasko, C; Sharma, A				Hettiarachchi, Suresh; Wasko, Conrad; Sharma, Ashish			Can antecedent moisture conditions modulate the increase in flood risk due to climate change in urban catchments?	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Antecedent moisture conditions; Climate change; Urban flooding; Continuous simulation	CONTINUOUS RAINFALL GENERATION; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; WATER MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; FUTURE; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; HYDROLOGY	Climate change coupled with the current trend in rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property. Adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge. Green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments. The analysis and results of this study show that AMC/IC does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events. We show that considering AMC/ICs coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change. The prevailing thought is that Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMCs) have little to no relevance in urban hydrology, particularly in relation to climate change. However, current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making AMC or Initial Conditions (IC) a factor in urban flooding. Despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of AMC/IC that can have an implication on urban flood management. Here, we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of AMCs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact AMC and starting conditions in stormwater Best Management Practices (SWBMPs), and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas. Using a comprehensive hydrologic/hydraulic model of an urban/developed catchment and continuous simulation, we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments. We consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years. We compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate.

Yet, they are often treated as distinct planning instruments. Some planning scholars have suggested that HMP and CCAP should be integrated since climate change impacts are increasing and communities have limited time and resources. But, it is unclear how synergistic these two planning approaches are in practice. Focusing on flooding as a key climate-related hazard, this study examines planning frameworks and helps to address this gap by exploring HMPs and CCAPs in three US cities at the forefront of flood resilience planning. We analyze the content of standalone HMPs and CCAPs in Boston, MA, and Seattle, WA, and a combined plan in Baltimore, MD to identify overlaps in practice and explore how, and to what extent, HMPs and CCAPs are synergistic.

Through their depiction of climate crisis floods, novels such as Megan Hunter's The End We Start From, Clare Morrall's When the Floods Came, and Sarah Hall's The Carhullan Army constitute a major imaginative response to climate change.Flood fictions as I define them are characterized by two features: first, the depiction of floods as an effect of and synecdoche for climate crisis, making use in particular of the historical and visual connotations of floods; and, second, the depiction of the literal submersion of the narratives themselves by means of language erosion and narrative fragmentation. As such, flood fictions tackle some of the imaginative and representative challenges posed by the Anthropocene. My reading of these novels provides an intervention in current debates on imagining and narrating climate crisis and presents a previously unexplored and underexplored subset of literary works.

Rural leaders-e.g., policymakers, state/federal agency professionals, non-profit organization leadership, and scholars - are pivotal for driving the programs and policies that support resilient practices, but our understanding of their perspectives on climate resilience writ large is limited. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 rural leaders in Missouri to elucidate their conceptualizations of climate resilience and identify catalysts and constraints for climate adaptation planning and action across rural landscapes. We investigated participants' perceptions of the major vulnerabilities of rural communities and landscapes, threats to rural areas, and potential steps for making rural Missouri more resilient in the face of climate change. We found that most rural leaders conceptualized climate resilience as responding to hazardous events rather than anticipating or planning for hazardous trends. The predominant threats identified were flooding and drought, which aligns with climate projections for the Midwest. Participants proposed a wide variety of specific steps to enhance resilience but had the highest agreement about the utility of expanding existing programs. The most comprehensive suite of solutions was offered by participants who conceptualized resilience as involving social, ecological, and economic systems, underscoring the importance of broad thinking for developing more holistic solutions to climate-associated threats and the potential impact of greater collaboration across domains. We highlight and discuss a Missouri-based levee setback project that was identified by participants as a showcase of collaborative resilience-building.

Adequate knowledge about how these changes will alter the hydrologic regime provides valuable information for future water resources planning and management. The current study attempts to analyze the joint consequences of these dynamics on the future hydrological response of the Gorganroud watershed in northern Iran. For landuse, the integrated Markov Chain analysis and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MC-MLPNN) algorithm were used to obtain landuse for 2030 and 2050. For climate, we developed future scenarios based on the downscaled data from MPI-ESM-MR for 2021-2040 and 2041-2060. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate watershed hydrology. We found that (1) from 1986 to 2050, agriculture and rangeland are likely to expand by 18.6% and 10.7% of the total watershed area, respectively, at the expense of forest covers. (2) Temperature and precipitation are expected to increase by 1.3 ? and 2.5 ? and by 31.7% and 27.1% for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) during 2021-2040 and 2041-2060, respectively, compared to the baseline of 1976-1995. (3) We found that the integrated landuse and climate change will likely increase annual evapotranspiration during 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 by 113.9% and 11.4%, lateral flow by 14.6% and 7%, baseflow by 166.7% and 77.2%, surface runoff by 54.2% and 41%, water yield by 50.5% and 35.9%, and streamflow by 48.6% and 32.1% for RCP8.5 compared to the baseline of 1976-1995.

Pictures Matter: How Images of Projected Sea-Level Rise Shape Long-Term Sustainable Design Decisions for Infrastructure Systems	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable infrastructure; climate and risk; vivid imagery; behavioral decision-making; logistic modeling; envision rating system	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; PERCEPTIONS; POLARIZATION; INVOLVEMENT; EXPERIENCE; GENDER; FOREST	Community input matters in long-term decisions related to climate change, including the development of public infrastructure. In order to assess the effect of different ways of informing the public about infrastructure projects, a sample of people in the United States (n = 630) was provided with a case study concerning the redevelopment of the San Diego Airport. Participants received the same written information about the projected future condition of the airport. In addition, participants received images either portraying current conditions or portraying conditions in 2100 based on NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) sea-level rise data. Participants were asked to choose 7 out of 21 design options to implement in the redevelopment project. The framework used for the design options stemmed from the Envision rating system. We analyzed the participants' selection of the credits using generalized linear mixed models. Those that received the images portraying the future were significantly more likely to select design options that would reduce the risk of climate change and flooding. Images portraying sea-level rise had different effects depending on participant demographics. Such images increased the selection of design elements related to the climate and risk for participants identifying as female or as Democrat. For participants identifying as male or as Republican, the same images increased their selection of design elements to enhance community public space. The results demonstrate the positive effects of portraying the future in terms of encouraging focus on long-term sustainable design decisions for infrastructure systems.

Ecohydrology and flood risk management under climate vulnerability in relation to the sustainable development goals (SDGs): a case study in Nagaa Mobarak Village, Egypt	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Climate change; Ecohydrology; Nature-based solutions; Flood risk management; Hydrological modeling; SDGs; Structural flood management	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WATER MANAGEMENT; METRO SYSTEMS; RIVER-BASIN; WASTE-WATER; SCS-CN; URBAN; IMPACTS; RUNOFF; URBANIZATION	This article aims to provide a thorough assessment of water quality and quantity incorporating the estimation of future patterns as a result of climate change from economic, environmental and social perspectives. Its scope extends from studying the physical parameters and rainfall patterns to maintaining an environmental flow with a better water quality using ecohydrological techniques. The village of Nagaa Mobarak in Souhag, Egypt, is taken as a case study being in a critical location that is vulnerable to flash floods. This paper managed to quantify change in water quantity and quality due to the impacts of flash floods and climate change. Several traditional engineering alternatives are proposed for flood management such as constructing a dam, a storage pond and a routing channel to the nearest water body; as well as non-traditional ecohydrological alternatives such as constructing a dam with vegetated foreshore, natural levees and constructed wetlands. The results of applying these methods for our case study showed that a hybrid solution that employs both traditional and non-traditional solutions for flood management is optimal. A constructed wetland along a section of the constructed channel for diverting flow into the Nagaa Hammade Canal would decrease the runoff volume and peak time so that the capacity of the Canal is not exceeded in a flood event and purifies the incoming stormwater improving its quality and the health of the ecosystem within the canal. Moreover, our proposed approach was investigated and found to target 10 out of the 17 UN SDGs.

J	Krauss, W				Krauss, Werner			Narratives of change and the co-development of climate services for action	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environmental humanities; Anthropology; Narrative theory; Climate service; Collaboration		After the Paris Agreement, the transition towards a carbon free society necessitates new forms of collaboration between climate science and society. In my article, I argue that the increasing participation of disciplines from the humanities represent a cultural turn in climate risk governance. At the example of my anthropological case study at the Northern German coastline, I show that the co-development of place-based climate services for action means a challenge to the science-based definition of climate change and the resulting problem-solving strategies. Climate change materializes in form of extreme weather events, changes in the seasons and sea level rise. Local narratives represent these changes, expand the problem definition of climate change and express the multiple entanglements of weather, climate and society. Past flood disasters and interactions with the sea are presented in different configurations of time and space that put emerging forms of climate services into context. Narratives of change serve as a localization device and as starting point for the co-development of climate services for action. Collaborations between science and humanities on the one hand, and between researchers and local actors on the other are an open-ended process. In form of a field report, I identify diverse narratives of change and first steps towards the co-development of new forms of climate services. At the example of a scenario workshop, I describe local visions of climate risk governance, with climate researchers as facilitators and moderators of public forums motivated for action. This essay provides an anthropological insight into this process and details the procedures of emerging collaborations, making use of field notes, anthropological self-reflection and narrative theory.

The data from Poland suggest that the decline was roughly synchronous and most likely occurred between the 9th and 10th centuries, with strong indications for the 10th century. The pollen data indicate that human impacts were not a major factor in the event. Instead, we hypothesize that one or a series of abrupt climatic shifts that caused floods and droughts at the end of the first millennium CE could have initiated this ecological disturbance, leading to a higher vulnerability of the alder trees to a pathogen outbreak. Following current observations of the decline of alder stands in Europe due to a Phytophthora outbreak, we suggest that a similar process may have occurred in the past. This study provides insight into long-term alder (mainly Alnus glutinosa) dynamics in a condition of climate change and illustrates its great resilience, enabling the natural, successful regeneration of alder stands after critical diebacks if environmental conditions improve. Our finding that the Alnus pollen decline reflects a roughly synchronous event indicates that the decline could be used as an over-regional chronostratigraphic marker for 800-1000 CE in pollen diagrams from a large part of the European Lowland.

In this exploratory study, we extend the Index to include future climate change and population projections using RCP 8.5 climate projections of coastal flood, river flood and drought, and SSP3 and SSP5 population projections for the period 2036 to 2065. For the three hazards considered, annually 1.3 billion people (150% increase), 1.8 billion people (249% increase) and 1.5 billion people (197% increase) in the mid-21st century are projected to be exposed under the 2015, SSP3 and SSP5 population estimates, respectively. Drought shows the highest exposure levels followed by river flood and then coastal flood, with some regional differences. The largest exposed population is projected in Asia, while the largest percent changes are projected in Africa and Oceania. Countries with largest current and projected risk including non-climatic factors are generally located in Africa, West and South Asia and Central America. An uncertainty analysis of the extended index shows that it is generally robust and not influenced by the methodological choices. The projected changes in risk and coping capacity (vulnerability) due to climate change are generally greater than those associated with population changes. Countries in Europe, Western and Northern Asia and Africa tend to show higher reduction levels in vulnerability (lack of coping capacity) required to nullify the adverse impacts of the projected amplified hazards and exposure. The required increase in coping capacity (decreased vulnerability) can inform decision-making processes on disaster risk reduction and adaptation options to maintain manageable risk levels at global and national scale. Overall, the extended INFORM Risk Index is a means to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation policy agendas to create conditions for greater policy impact, more efficient use of resources and more effective action in protecting life, livelihoods and valuable assets.

Strategies for mitigation of climate change: a review	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Review						Climate change mitigation; Negative emissions technologies; Carbon dioxide removal; Decarbonization technologies; Radiative forcing geoengineering technologies	ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; SOLAR-RADIATION MANAGEMENT; ENERGY; BIOCHAR; SEQUESTRATION; EMISSIONS; CAPTURE; TECHNOLOGY; ELECTRICITY; AGREEMENT	Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 degrees C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to $131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO(2)emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth's radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.

A look into our future under climate change? Adaptation and migration intentions following extreme flooding in the Netherlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Migration; Adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Protection motivation theory; Household survey	SEA-LEVEL RISE; DECISION-MAKING; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; INSURANCE; EMOTIONS; MODELS; THREAT	Worldwide, increased flood risk from climate change prompts adaptive behavior of households in situ or through migration. Both can be sensible adaptation responses involving tradeoffs, and understanding their drivers is important for effective climate policy. However, in-situ adaptation and migration are rarely studied in combination and research on how extreme events trigger adaptive behavior in originally low-risk areas is lacking. We analyze survey data from residents affected by the extreme summer floods of 2021 in the Netherlands to contribute to fill this research gap. Our results indicate that current low levels of flood-related migration are likely to increase under higher flood risk. Undertaken in-situ adaptation may act as a barrier for further insitu adaptation or migration behavior. Where in-situ adaptation is mostly related to cognitive factors including risk perceptions, response efficacy and self-efficacy, migration seems to be driven by flood-related emotions. Personal flood experience, mediated by worry, is strongly associated with both types of adaptive behavior. We discuss how policymakers can use these insights to guide and anticipate household adaptation behavior.	[Duijndam, Sem J.; Botzen, W. J. Wouter; Endendijk, Thijs; de Moel, Hans; Aerts, Jeroen C. J.

Tracking Pathways to Recovery from Climate Shocks and Resilience Enhancement	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pathways; Recovery; Floods; Drought; Resilience; Social-ecological system; Pastoral communities	MIXED METHODS RESEARCH; ADAPTATION PATHWAYS; VULNERABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATION; FRAMEWORK; OPTIONS	Climate change is increasingly becoming a threat to a wide range of community livelihoods in the agro-pastoral systems across scales. Hence, recovery from impacts caused by climate change requires rational decisions, particularly how resources and activities can be mobilized to enhance resilience. In this paper, we track pathways to recovery from such climate shocks in the agro-pastoral systems in three villages; Naitolia, MwakiniJuu and MswakiniChini in northern Tanzania. A mixed methods approach was used that entailed 120 questionnaire respondents and three focus group discussion sessions, one in each village. Our findings show that livelihood assets and activities are inadequate to buffer the impacts of climate change. Despite rules and regulations that guide resource utilization; communities will continue facing climate related impacts. This is due to inherent cultural dispositions that hinder transformation from one form of livelihood assets to the other. This restricts the reception of new frontiers of experiential knowledge that would allow for livelihood diversification outside the climate dependence scenario even after the occurrence of climate hazards. We argue that any attempt of building the resilience of any social-ecological system must consider the cultural backgrounds of the communities in which resilience building is sought.

To explore the mechanism of dynamic and functional changes in ecosystems driven by extreme drought and flood events (EDFEs) in the future and the interaction between the two, this study focuses on the mutual feedback relationship between EDFEs and the ecological succession of vegetation. To accomplish this target, we reviewed relevant studies of the impacts of EDFEs on vegetation ecology (including growth status and living states) and that of feedback of ecological succession of vegetation to EDFEs. This study is of great significance for accurately predicting the future dynamic succession of plant communities, and the circulation of materials of future ecosystem with ongoing climate change, which provides fundamental and scientific basis for the establishment of ecological protection and restoration strategies in response to frequent climate extremes.

The nexus of extreme weather events and water quality is of great significance in the climate change economics theory and related literature. This research thus investigates the impact of extreme weather events on water quality by using unbalanced panel data covering 62 countries from 1991 to 2018 and finds that extreme weather may strongly hurt water quality, which not only is impactful in the current year but also lasts over the next 10 years. We further show that floods have a greater negative impact on water quality than droughts. In addition, the significant impact on water quality is manifested in non-high-income countries and in countries with low technology innovation related to water resources, but not in high-income countries nor in countries with high water innovation. Overall, the findings merit particular attention from policy makers.

To do so, we construct a novel measure of exposure to floods, using data on more than 3300 flood events worldwide, as an exogenous source of population displacement. We combine this with city level observations of thousands of urban social disorder events over the period 1985-2015. Exposure to floods is found to be associated with higher intensity of urban social disorder. Our evidence suggests that the effects of floods on urban disorder occur in part through the displacement of population into large cities. Exploring the information on urban disorder events in more detail, we find that the association between city growth and urban disorder is strongest for events related to public service provision, prices and wages.

This paper explores three major European cities that have policies in place that are supposed to facilitate the installation of green roofs. We ask what approaches were chosen by local authorities to promote green roofs and which factors facilitated their implementation. Our analysis is based on implementation literature in general as well as adaptation policy literature in particular. It combines literature reviews and eleven interviews with policymakers and other stakeholders. The study reveals that immediate threats and particular events (e.g., urban heat islands or floods), an overall social and political environment favoring green solutions, so-called change agents, and a supportive framing determine if green roofs are considered as an attractive solution. However, even when multiple benefits of green roofs are beyond doubt, local governments largely prefer fiscal incentives over mandatory policies.

Changes in climate parameters, gender-based perceptions of climate, as well as gender-based response and adaptation practices were assessed in accordance with specific research objectives. A total of 200 participants were surveyed through a mixed method approach using 41 years of climate data. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered equally in the two States and 52 in-depth interviews were conducted within male and female farmers that were 40 years and above age using a purposive sampling method. Results from Nassarawa State showed a downward trend in rainfall and an upward trend in both minimum and maximum temperatures. The farmers perceived climate change differently, with observed changes in climate variables: temperature and precipitation, resulting in extreme floods, drought, and rainfall onset and leading to varying adaptation practices. The study concluded that gender plays a significant role in the adoption of adaptation practices in the agricultural sector and that males often have more access to resources and decision-making power in farming as the heads of households. There is a need for better gender-sensitive approaches to adaptation planning and implementation to ensure that both men and women have equal opportunities to benefit from adaptation options in agriculture.

J	Zadafiya, G; Ladavia, CP; Gandhi, H				Zadafiya, Gautam; Ladavia, Chirag Pravinbhai; Gandhi, Haresh			Downscaling approach for analysis and forecasting of meteorological parameters and identification of different drought years	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; GCM; rainfall; RCP 85; SPI; statistical downscaling; temperature	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; CHINA	Natural disasters related to water resources as a result of climate change are becoming a major concern for the entire world. The majority of people in India work in agriculture. Droughts, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters are all linked to uncertainty in meteorological parameters. The primary goal of this research is to investigate and forecast various meteorological parameters in the Bhavnagar district of the Gujarat region. The statistical downscaling technique uses Global Climate Model (GCM) data for analysis, while the dynamic downscaling technique uses Regional Climate Model (RCM) data. RCM data are prepared for important places of the Earth. GCM data are freely available for all parts of the Earth. So, in this study, GCM data are used. RCM data and dynamic downscaling make the process complicated. Using GCM data and the statistical downscaling technique, meteorological parameters i.e. maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and rainfall can be accurately predicted in this study. To predict meteorological parameters, RCP 8.5 scenario and SPI are used to identify the various types of drought years of the study area. Flood hazard maps and drought contingency plans can be prepared based on predicted meteorological parameters. According to SPI analysis, Bhavnagar will experience 26 mild, 8 moderate, 2 severe, and 3 special droughts up to the year 2100.

COLEOPTERA IN FLOODS: BIOTIC SURVEYS, FISH FOOD, ADAPTATION, RECONSTRUCTION OF PALEOENVIRONMENTS, AND PRECONSTRUCTION OF NEOENVIRONMENTS	COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN			English	Article						flood refuse; flood drift; inundation; climate change; taphonomy	TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES; COLLECTION DATA; INSECT REMAINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEW-BRUNSWICK; FAUNA; FLOODPLAIN; STREAM; DRIFT; ARTHROPODS	Coleoptera in flood debris are involved in several apparently disparate, but ultimately interrelated disciplines. In some situations, more than 100 beetle species have been collected from debris immediately after a flood and can greatly augment a biotic survey. Beetles entrained in floods represent an important component of terrestrial inputs into lotic systems. Many species of beetles have evolved morphological and behavioral adaptations to avoid or exploit the costs and benefits of flooding and are dependent on floods for habitat formation in the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone along rivers. Quaternary beetle fossils, often found in fluvial deposits, offer a powerful tool to reconstruct past climates and ecosystems, and an important way to better understand the history of a species' distribution. However, the categories above are artificial and overlapping. With rare exception, studies linking these disciplines could not be found. For example, by studying beetles in flood debris today, paleontologists can personally witness the creation of a thanatocoenosis (death assemblage) produced by the same process acting on the same species that left fossils 100,000 years ago. Continued study of the interaction of beetles and floods, especially in light of global climate change, carries the potential to better predict ecosystem-wide changes in the near future.

An important driver is the continuation of new assets being built in flood prone locations. Over the last decade over 120 000 new homes in England and Wales have been built in flood prone areas. While the yearly rates of new homes in flood risk areas have increased only moderately on the national level, significant differences between and within regions as well as between different flood types exist. Using property level data on new homes built over the last decade and information on the socio-economic development of neighbourhoods, we analyse spatial clusters of disproportional increase in flood exposure from recently built homes and investigate how these patterns evolve under different future climate scenarios. We find that a disproportionately higher number of homes built in struggling or declining neighbourhoods between 2008 and 2018 is expected to end up in areas at a high risk of flooding over their lifetime as a result of climate change. Based on these findings, we discuss issues regarding future spending on flood defences, affordability of private level flood protection and insurance as well as the role of spatial planning for adaptation in the face of climate change.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Tao, H; Yao, J				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Tao, Hui; Yao, Jing			Integrated model projections of climate change impacts on water-level dynamics in the large Poyang Lake (China)	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; floods and droughts; hydrological projection; integrated model; Poyang Lake	RESOURCES	This study outlines a framework for examining potential impacts of future climate change in Poyang Lake water levels using linked models. The catchment hydrological model (WATLAC) was used to simulate river runoffs from a baseline period (1986-2005) and near-future (2020-2035) climate scenarios based on eight global climate models (GCMs). Outputs from the hydrological model combined with the Yangtze River's effects were fed into a lake water-level model, developing in the back-propagation neural network. Model projections indicate that spring-summer water levels of Poyang Lake are expected to increase by 5-25%, and autumn-winter water levels are likely to be lower and decrease by 5-30%, relative to the baseline period. This amounts to higher lake water levels by as much as 2 m in flood seasons and lower water levels in dry seasons in the range of 0.1-1.3 m, indicating that the lake may be wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier. The probability of occurrence for both the extreme high and low water levels may exhibit obviously increasing trends by up to 5% more than at present, indicating an increased risk in the severity of lake floods and droughts. Projected changes also include possible shifts in the timing and magnitude of the lake water levels.

Future Public Sector Flood Risk and Risk Sharing Arrangements: An Assessment for Austria	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation; Flood risk; Insurance; Public sector; Risk reduction	DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; RIVER-FLOOD; INSURANCE; GERMANY; PROTECTION; REDUCTION; FRAMEWORK	Climate change, along with socio-economic development, will increase the economic impacts of floods. While the factors that influence flood risk to private property have been extensively studied, the risk that natural disasters pose to public infrastructure and the resulting implications on public sector budgets, have received less attention. We address this gap by developing a two-staged model framework, which first assesses the flood risk to public infrastructure in Austria. Combining exposure and vulnerability information at the building level with inundation maps, we project an increase in riverine flood damage, which progressively burdens public budgets. Second, the risk estimates are integrated into an insurance model, which analyzes three different compensation arrangements in terms of the monetary burden they place on future governments' budgets and the respective volatility of payments. Formalized insurance compensation arrangements offer incentives for risk reduction measures, which lower the burden on public budgets by reducing the vulnerability of buildings that are exposed to flooding. They also significantly reduce the volatility of payments and thereby improve the predictability of flood damage expenditures. These features indicate that more formalized insurance arrangements are an improvement over the purely public compensation arrangement currently in place in Austria.

In this study, a new and mechanized postharvest system that integrates field handling and drying of the paddy grains is proposed to speed up the operation and help ensure a good quality harvest even when affected by typhoons or floods. The system makes use of eight 500 kg capacity specially-designed bags that function both as grain containers during transport and as drying bins. The drying operation is accomplished using these bags while mounted on the floor inside a typhoon-resistant shelter.	[Orge, R. F.; Sawey, D. A.; Leal, L., V; Gagelonia, E.

In particular, much damage occurs due to urban inundation caused by stream flooding as a result of climate change. Thus, this study aims to analyze the effect of climate change on flood damage targeting the Wonjucheon basin, which is an urban stream flowing the city. For future rainfall data, RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 8.5 climate change scenario data was used, statistical detailed using SDQDM (Spatial Disaggregation with Quantile Delta Mapping) techniques, and daily data was downscaled using Copula model. In general, the flood damage rate is calculated by using the area ratio according to the land use in the administrative district, but in this study, the flood damage rate is calculated using the flood damage rate proposed in the multi-dimensional flood damage analysis using Building Inventory. Using the created future rainfall data and current data, the runoff in the Wonjucheon basin, Wonju-si, South Korea, by rainfall frequency was calculated through the Spatial Runoff Assessment Tool (S-RAT) model, which was a distributed rainfall-runoff model. The runoff was calculated using 100-year and 200-year frequency rainfalls for a four-hour duration and the flood damage area was calculated by applying the calculated runoff to the Flo-2D model, was developed by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in United State of America, which was a flood inundation model. As a result of calculating the amount of discharge, it was analyzed that the average amount of discharge increased by 16% over the 100-year, 200-year frequency. The calculated result of the flood damage area was analyzed and the analysis results showed that the future flood damage area increased by around 30% at the 100-year frequency and around 15% at the 200-year frequency. The estimated flood damage by rainfall frequency was calculated using the flood damage area by frequency and multi-dimensional analysis, and the analysis result exhibited that the damage increased by around 23% at the 100-year frequency and around 45% at the 200-year frequency.

J	Parsons, L				Parsons, Laurie			Strategic environmental ignorance: Antipolitical knowledge gaps from drought measurement to adaptation in Cambodia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Environmental Data; Climate change politics; Anti-politics of climate change; Adaptation; Agnotology; Cambodia	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; POLITICS; SCIENCE; LOGIC	In shaping environmental policy, knowledge is power. Yet the opposite is also true. Control over the absence of knowledge facilitates certain policy outcomes being deflected, obscured, or magnified in a way that furthers political, personal, or institutional ends. Applying previous work on ignorance studies and agnotology to the development of Cambodian drought policy, the paper demonstrates how data gaps, restrictions on data sharing, and obstacles to data dissemination serve institutional interests and shape policy development. It proceeds in three parts, each reflecting one aspect of drought sensing in Cambodia and more broadly: hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural. First, how data on the Mekong River is shaped by regional geopolitics. Second, how national rainfall and flood data reflect the political geography of sub-national government administration. Third, how this multi-scalar landscape of political and institutional interests links data generation, data dissemination and adaptation policy, closing certain adaptation pathways, whilst opening others.

Therefore, restoring disturbed and degraded peatlands is an emerging priority in efforts to mitigate climate change. While restoration can revive multiple ecosystem functions, including carbon storage, the resilience of restored peatlands to climate change and other disturbances remains poorly understood. Here, we review the recent literature on the response of degraded and restored peatlands to fire, drought and flood. We find that degraded sites can generally be restored in a way that allows for net carbon sequestration. However, biodiversity, hydrological regime, and peat soil structure are not always fully restored, even after a decade of restoration efforts, potentially weakening ecosystem resilience to future disturbances. As the recovery of degraded peatlands is fundamental to achieving net-zero goals and biodiversity targets, sound science and monitoring efforts are needed to further inform restoration investments and priorities. Restoring degraded peatlands can return them to a state of net carbon sequestration and enhance their ecosystem resilience, highlighting the importance of peatland protection and restoration in climate mitigation, according to a synthesis of evidence from temperate and high latitude peatlands.

Four CBAs are conducted: (i) a standard CBA; (ii) a standard CBA considering equity; (iii) a standard CBA considering equity and employment; and (iv) a standard CBA considering equity, employment and risk aversion. All CBAs are conducted using a time frame of 2014-2080 and considering a 100-year return period under a middle of the road emission scenario (RCP4.5). A sensitivity analysis is also undertaken. Results suggest that the economic efficiency of the adaptation investment is contingent on what types of considerations are included within CBA. Integrating elements of employment, equity and risk aversion can strengthen or weaken the case for action (leading to higher or lower net-present values) and (depending on the discount rate chosen) may even be the deciding factor for determining whether a particular action should be carried out or not (whether the net-present value is positive or negative).

The Brahmaputra Basin (BB), a biodiversity hotspot, is among the world's wettest regions and is vulnerable to climate change. Using ground and satellite-based datasets from multiple sources and a percentile-based analysis from 1998 to 2018, it is found that an asymmetric trend exists in extreme rainfall over the hills and the adjacent plains of the basin. The hills experience a decline in rainfall, whereas, over the plains, an increase is observed on similar rainfall days. During 1998-2018, mean accumulated rainfall over the whole basin declined by as much as similar to 60% during the October to December (OND) period. Similarly, a decline of similar to 20% is observed for June to September (JJAS). The most significant reduction in mean rainfall was mainly over the wettest regions of the basin, such as Cherrapunji/Mawsynram and is concentrated in the highest percentile (extreme events) of rainfall distribution. Such an overall decline in total rainfall coupled with altitudinal asymmetry in percentile distributions of rainfall may contribute towards flood hazards with changing lead time for warning, posing severe socio-economic challenges.

The present study aims to understand the crucial design parameters by introducing physically based covariates in the location parameter of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The analysis is carried out over 30 streamflow gauging stations located across the Godavari River basin, India. To compare the return period, risk and reliability between the stationary and non-stationary conditions, the Expected Waiting Time (EWT) approach is used. The analysis reveals that half of the gauging stations are impacted by large-scale modes/oscillations and regional hydrological variability, primarily by the Indian Summer Monsoon Index (ISMI) and precipitation. The EWT interpretation estimates that the non-stationary return period, risk, and reliability are significantly different from under the stationary condition. Hence, a non-stationary approach can be useful to water managers and policymakers in order to devise sustainable and resilient water resource infrastructure under a climate change scenario.

We argue that these processes - evictions and invisibilizations - create a heightened vulnerability to climate change impacts for these individuals. The paper uses secondary survey data on compact Roma groups in Romania and analyses qualitative and cartographic information collected by the authors (2019) in two mid-sized cities in Romania to flesh out the particular slum ecologies that emerge following evictions. The focus is also on the subtle processes of invisibilization that render displaced Roma vulnerable and rob them of the "right to the city" in terms of climate change adaptation. Our finding is that evicted Roma experience innumerable, "routine" weather-related impacts, such as floods, storms or cold. By exploring Roma's heightened exposure, sensitivity and reduced adaptive capacity, we show how these impacts increase their vulnerability to future extreme weather events. These findings are indicative of a broader process of fragmentation taking place in urban areas throughout Eastern Europe, which render invisible some very real barriers to climate change adaptation.

Yet, such a solution is often ignored when projecting or assessing river flood risk under future climate change. To fill this gap, we apply a hydrological modeling platform integrating wetland modules to a 297,000km(2) large river basin in Northeast China under different climate change scenarios. The overarching goal of this study is to predict future precipitation extremes and flood events, and to explore whether and to what extent wetlands can effectively mitigate the risk of future flood at the basin scale. We first assessed the trend in future precipitation extremes extracted from multi-global climate models (GCMs) and found that the future precipitation extremes will increase both under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The increasing precipitation extremes, therefore, are projected to bring about higher flood risks with the increase in warming levels. Wetlands can suppress flood duration, mean flow, volume, and peak by 1.9-10.2%, 4.6-7.1%, 8.7-15.7% and 12.5-14.1% under future climate change in this large river basin, respectively. Our study found that wetlands can attenuate the risk of floods with a 2- and 5-year return period to a great extent. However, the wetland mitigation function is limited to floods with a 10-, 20-, and 50- return, and even failed to extreme floods with a 100- and 200-year return. These findings imply that future precipitation extremes will cause flood risks in this large river basin that cannot be mitigated by its wetlands, and substantial wetland restoration is needed to enhance the capacity of their service in order to improve the basin's resilience to future flood risks.

Capacity-elevation (C-E) curves are vital for reservoir routing and dam operation. Different models are available for representing C-E relationships. Power and logarithmic laws are evaluated and tested for reservoir routing. The evaluation is based on the analysis of 136 reservoirs across different regions of Saudi Arabia (SA). The analysis revealed that 75.7% of the reservoirs are of flood plain foothill type. A case study on Al-Lith dam basin is utilized for application based on measured events. The resulting routed outflow hydrographs showed that the logarithmic law is better to represent the reservoir than the power law. With respect to the climate change effect, the results show that the predicted rainfall from Representative Concentration Pathways scenario (RCP4.5) increased by about 20 to 31.4% from 5 to 100 years return periods respectively with an average of 27%. While for scenario RCP8.5, the predicted rainfall increased by 42% to about 55% from 5 to 100 years return periods respectively with an average of 49%. For the RCP4.5 scenario, the peak flows,Q(p), and volumes,W, increased by an average of 69% and 67% respectively. While for the RCP8.5 scenario, the same parameters increased by an average of 139% and 134% respectively. The effect of transmission losses in the results seems to be minor with respect to climate change signal (for RCP4.5,Q(p)andWare lowered on average by 2% and 0.5% respectively, and for RCP8.5,Q(p)andWare lowered on average by 4.5% and 1.3% respectively). The results of this research recommend to use the logarithmic law and to take into account the effect of climate change on future dam projects in SA.

Water resources management is one of the key challenges to reduce disaster risk. In Northern Thailand, flood and drought have always occurred because of the climate change impact and non-systematic management in the conjunctive use of both sources of water. Therefore, this study aims to assess the climate change impact on surface water and groundwater of the Yom and Nan river basins, located in the upper part of Thailand. The surface water and groundwater regimes are generated by a fully coupled SWAT-MODFLOW model. The future climate scenarios are considered from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5, presented by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), in order to mainly focus on the minimum and maximum Green House Gas (GHG) emissions scenarios during the near future (2021-2045) periods. The results show that the average annual air temperature rises by approximately 0.5-0.6 degrees C and 0.9-1.0 degrees C under the minimum (RCP 2.6) and maximum (RCP 8.5) GHG emission scenarios, respectively. The annual rainfall, obtained from both scenarios, increased by the same range of 20-200 mm/year, on average. The summation of surface water (water yield) and groundwater recharge (water percolation) in the Yom river basin decreased by 443.98 and 316.77 million m(3)/year under the RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. While, in the Nan river basin, it is projected to increase by 355 million m(3)/year under RCP 2.6 but decrease by 20.79 million m(3)/year under RCP 8.5. These quantitative changes can directly impact water availability when evaluating the water demand for consumption, industry, and agriculture.

There have been attempts to identify what controls these regionally varying trends, but these attempts were limited to certain-for example, climatic-variables or to smaller regions, using different methods and datasets each time. Here we attribute the trends in annual maximum streamflow for 4,390 gauging stations across the CONUS in the period 1960-2010, while using a novel combination of methods and an unprecedented variety of potential controlling variables to allow large-scale comparisons and minimize biases. Using process-based flood classification and complex networks, we find 10 distinct clusters of catchments with similar flood behavior. We compile a set of 31 hydro-climatological and land use variables as predictors for 10 separate Random Forest models, allowing us to find the main controls the flood magnitude trends for each cluster. By using Accumulated Local Effect plots, we can understand how these controls influence the trends in the flood magnitude. We show that hydro-climatologic changes and land use are of similar importance for flood magnitude trends across the CONUS. Static land use variables are more important than their trends, suggesting that land use is able to attenuate (forested areas) or amplify (urbanized areas) the effects of climatic changes on flood magnitudes. For some variables, we find opposing effects in different regions, showing that flood trend controls are highly dependent on regional characteristics and that our novel approach is necessary to attribute flood magnitude trends reliably at the continental scale while maintaining sensitivity to regional controls.

J	Malji, A; Obana, L; Hopkins, C				Malji, Andrea; Obana, Laurabell; Hopkins, Cidney			When Home Disappears: South Asia and the Growing Risk of Climate Conflict	TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE			English	Article						Bangladesh; South Asia; climate change; climate refugees; climate conflict; Rohingya	CIVIL-WAR; MIGRATION; SECURITY; POLITICS; DROUGHT; INSURGENCY; DECISIONS; REFUGEES	This article highlights the multiple risks of political violence facing South Asia amid the backdrop of climate change. Specifically, it draws attention to Bangladesh and its shared border with Northeast India, a region with a long history of terrorism and insurgency. As the impact from climate change intensifies, there are several specific vulnerabilities in the region. First, internal migration within Bangladesh threatens to stress already weak infrastructures, especially in urban centers like Dhaka, which already hosts thousands of climate migrants. Internal rural-to-rural migration may further instigate clashes among farmers as they compete for diminishing agricultural resources. Second, cross-border migration from Bangladesh into India threatens to escalate existing tensions between Indians and Bangladeshi migrants, particularly in Northeast India. Violent identity movements within Northeast India are already common and a key grievance has been Bangladeshi presence in the region. These grievances have historically escalated into multiple separatist and terrorist organizations and threaten to escalate again. Hindu nationalist groups threaten to further exploit these existing tensions for political gain. Third, Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are situated in a location that is at very high-risk for climate disasters. Cyclones and flooding threaten to create a new humanitarian crisis in the region. Finally, both Hindu and Islamic extremist groups may exploit grievances and utilize it for recruitment efforts. Together, these factors make South Asia particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Using GIS, we map the climate vulnerable areas of Bangladesh alongside locations that have experienced fatal political violence from 2015-2020. We find that each administrative division faces its own unique challenges, but urban centers, areas near water, and border regions are the most vulnerable to climate conflict.

As a result, flood risk and flood-related losses might increase. It is therefore essential to simulate potential floods not only relying on historical but also future projecting data. Such simulations can provide necessary information for the development of flood protection measures and spatial planning. This paper analyzes the risk of compound flooding in the Dane River under different river discharge and Klaipeda Strait water level probabilities. Additionally, we examine how a water level rise of 1 m in the Klaipeda Strait could impact Dane River floods in Klaipeda city. Flood extent was estimated with the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and visualized with ArcGIS Pro. Research results show that a rise in the water level in the Klaipeda Strait has a greater impact on the central part of Klaipeda city, while that of the maximum discharge rates of the river affected the northern upstream part of the analyzed river section. A sea level rise of 1 m could lead to an increase in areas affected by Dane floods by up to three times. Floods can cause significant damage to the infrastructure of Klaipeda port city, urbanized territories in the city center, and residential areas in the northern part of the city. Our results confirm that, in the long run, sea level rise will significantly impact the urban areas of the Klaipeda city situated near the Baltic Sea coast.

Dual stresses of flooding and agricultural land use reduce earthworm populations more than the individual stressors	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flooding; Land use; Earthworms; Climate change; Population dynamics	ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL COMPACTION; CARBON STOCKS; LUMBRICIDAE; TILLAGE; IMPACT; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY	Global climate change is leading to a significant increase in flooding events in many countries. Current practices to prevent damage to downstream urban areas include allowing the flooding of upstream agricultural land. Earthworms are ecosystem engineers, but their abundances in arable land are already reduced due to pressure from farming practices. If flooding increases on agricultural land, it is important to understand how earthworms will respond to the dual stresses of flooding and agricultural land use. The earthworm populations under three land uses (pasture, field margin, and crops), across two UK fields, were sampled seasonally over an 18-month period in areas of the fields which flood frequently and areas which flood only rarely. Earthworm abundance in the crop and pasture soils and total earthworm biomass in the crop soils was significantly lower in the frequently flooded areas than in the rarely flooded areas. The relative percentage difference in the populations between the rarely and frequently flooded areas was greater in the crop soils (-59.18% abundance, -63.49% biomass) than the pasture soils (-13.39% abundance, -9.66% biomass). In the margin soils, earthworm abundance was significantly greater in the frequently flooded areas (+140.56%), likely due to higher soil organic matter content and lower bulk density resulting in soil conditions more amenable to earthworms. The findings of this study show that earthworm populations already stressed by the activities associated with arable land use are more susceptible to flooding than populations in pasture fields, suggesting that arable earthworm populations are likely to be increasingly at risk with increased flooding.

There is evidence of increasing trends in temperature extremes in most countries of South Asia, while in a few regions, temperature extremes have been decreasing. Heatwaves have intensified, which has contributed to accelerating drought and extreme flood events in most South Asian countries. Overall changes in rainfall and temperature have led to alterations in water availability in this region. With few exceptions, the general phenomenon in most South Asian countries is that rainfall intensity has increased, but with a reduced number of wet days. Studies that associate rainfall and temperature in the region of South Asia are scarce and rainfall extremes have been studied more extensively than temperature extremes. In fact, temperature trends are spatially less coherent than rainfall trends in most south Asian countries. It is more likely correlated for the teleconnection and South Asian climate for influencing the temperature and rainfall pattern, rather than any other factors. When it comes to trend estimations, statistical slope detection metrics, such as simple linear regression, have been commonly used to detect and quantify mean trends for countries in the regions of South Asia. However, application lacks in usage of robust nonparametric statistical tests to quantify temperature and rainfall extremes in many countries of South Asia. Statistical downscaling is recommended for better prediction accuracy as well as to find spatial coherence in trends.

The objective of the article is to (i) integrate stakeholders' opinions and preferences on identified hazards, i.e., coastal flooding, water scarcity, and heat stress, derived by physically based numerical modeling under current and future climate change conditions and attributed in the form of an Integrated deltaic risk index (IDRI) at a specific case study area, and (ii) investigate whether and how the stakeholders' opinions differentiate the initial outputs coming from the mathematical models. Doing so, stakeholders' mapping was conducted in tandem with interviews for the detection of responsibilities, tasks, importance, and influence, followed by a structured questionnaire for registering the stakeholders' perception on climate change impacts and relevant estimated hazards at the same deltaic case study area. Thereafter, a stakeholder-based risk assessment model was constructed based on two methods: (a) stakeholders' opinion and answers about the impact of each identified hazard are equally taken into consideration, and (b) stakeholders are divided into groups and evaluated through multi-criteria analysis. Finally, the produced weights by the two methods are appropriately coupled with the identified hazards and resulted in the development of a Stakeholder Participatory multi-Risk Index (SPmRI) per method. The comparison of the produced SPmRIs with the IDRI, which was formulated without considering any stakeholders' participation, reveals noticeable differentiation of modeled outputs especially in cases of high index values, corroborating the need for stakeholders' opinion inclusion through the SPmRI approach. The proposed methodology fosters the interaction of stakeholders' perception with modeling-based hazard assessment as a modern tool for decision-making processes.

Weather extremes and resulting impacts such as heat waves and flash floods are already influencing the quality of life in cities and impact on infrastructure, human health and city life. In this study, we investigated perception of and economic preferences for adaptation to climate change in one of Europe's capital cities to inform its planning policy. Through a choice experiment, we elicit the preferences of a sample (n = 550) from Prague, Czech Republic, for a citywide policy which would increase the use of six commonly used nature-based solutions (NBS) in public spaces and on public buildings across the city. Three attributes were used to describe this policy: (i) the locations where NBS would predominantly be implemented, (ii) the species diversity of these measures, and (iii) their implied costs for households. Our results showed that the NBS policy is widely supported by the public over the status quo and that this preference is mirrored in citizens' concerns about climate change and the risks posed by heatwaves particularly. Species diversity matters in the portrayed scenarios, suggesting that (bio)diverse NBS generate additional public value over single species measures and that policy which targets biodiversity may gain support. Implementation of NBS in public spaces (e.g., street trees, rain gardens) is preferred over measures implemented on public buildings (green roofs and facades). Furthermore, adverse experiences with heatwaves has increased support for the policy. The presented results provide evidence that adaptation planning through NBS is likely to generate significant public value which is expected to increase with the intensifying effects of climate change.

The practical challenges of achieving sustainable wetland agriculture in Nigeria's Cross River basin	WATER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Resilient agriculture; climate change; indigenous practices; wetlands; CRB; Nigeria		The practical challenges of achieving sustainable wetland agriculture in Nigeria are examined. Three wetland communities were studied with observations, meetings, focus groups, interviews, a workshop and a review of the literature. We find that the available wetlands are greatly under-utilized due to meteorological and climate-related challenges, poor human capacities, absence of science-policy collaboration, complex land tenure regimes and a lack of supportive infrastructure. Climate change impact manifests in either excessive seasonal flooding or prolonged drought, with consequences for livelihoods. Improving the utilization and productivity of the wetlands will require strong public policies, appropriate investment, human capacity building, science-policy-society cooperation and supportive infrastructure.

Since the 1960s, the TP has experienced significant spatial-variant warming, vital to changing the region's terrestrial ecosystem. To understand surface air temperature (SAT) regimes over the TP, we investigated their link with teleconnections using observational and reanalysis datasets from 1982 to 2019. We employed wavelet analysis, empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT), partial regression, canonical correlation analysis and t test. Our results indicate an asymmetrical connection between teleconnections and SAT, with Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) predominant over the northern TP. In contrast, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is more prevalent in the southern part. The spatial variance was potentially related to windspeed, total cloud cover (TCC), net longwave radiation (NLWR), net shortwave radiation (NSWR), cloud-forcing net longwave flux (CF-NLWF) and cloud-forcing net shortwave flux (CF-NLWF) anomalies. ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modulate cloud cover variation in the southern TP, mainly the southwest, via the monsoon and subtropical westerlies. In the north, cloud cover variation is related to the moisture transported by the AMO-induced prevailing westerlies. The study examined the complex interplay between teleconnections, SAT and cloud radiative forcing by examining the cloud cover and radiation balance relationship. These findings contribute to understanding climate change impacts on the TP, informing climate projections and guiding adaptation strategies by elucidating the relationship between TP temperature variation and oceanic-atmospheric oscillation patterns.

This study was designed to examine the relative contributions of the hydrological surface condition changes and climate change in the flood runoff of a 45,421-km(2) watershed in the Loess Plateau region. Statistical analytical methods, including Kendall's trend test, the Theisen median trend analysis, and cumulative anomaly method, were used to detect trends in the relationship between the climatic variables, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use/cover change (LUCC) data, and observed flood runoff. A grid-cell distributed rainfall-runoff model was used to detect the quantitative hydrologic responses to the climatic variability and land-use change. We found that climatic variables were not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05) over the study period. From 1985 to 2013, the cropland area continued to decrease, while the forest land, pastures, and residential areas increased in the Jinghe River Basin. Affected by LUCC and climate change, the peak discharges and flood volumes decreased by 8-22% and 5-67%, respectively. This study can provide a reference for future land-use planning and flood runoff control policy formulation and for revision in the study area.

It requires systemic climate change adaptation to address the complexity of risks across multiple domains and tackle the uncertainties of future scenarios. This paper introduces a multirisk analysis of climate hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and risk severity, specifically designed to hotspot geographic locations and prioritize system receptors that are affected by climate-related extremes. The analysis is demonstrated for the Metropolitan City of Venice. Representative scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of climate threats (i.e., storm surges, pluvial flood, heat waves, and drought) are selected and represented by projections of Regional Climate Models for a 30-year period (2021-2050). A sample of results is as follows. First, an increase in the risk is largely due to drought, pluvial flood, and storm surge, depending on the areas of interest, with the overall situation worsening under the RCP8.5 scenario. Second, particular locations have colocated vulnerable receptors at higher risk, concentrated in the urban centers (e.g., housing, railways, roads) and along the coast (e.g., beaches, wetlands, primary sector). Third, risk communication of potential environmental and socio-economic losses via the multirisk maps is useful to stakeholders and public administration. Fourth, the multirisk maps recommend priorities for future investigation and risk management, such as collection of sensor data, elaboration of mitigations, and adaptation plans at hotspot locations.

Simultaneously, the growing human population has been exerting pressure on available water and soil resources due to overuse or unplanned use. While greenhouse gas emissions have intensified, the fertility of agricultural soils has declined globally due to the exposure of soils to frequent flooding, desertification, and salinization (resulting from extreme weather events). The current review aims to give an overview of damages caused to the soil-plant system by extreme weather events and provide a perspective on how biochar can repair the damaged system. Biochar is known to improve soil fertility, increase crop productivity and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions via sustainable recycling of bio-waste. Beneficial properties of biochar such as alkaline pH, high cation exchange capacity, abundant surface functional groups, remarkable surface area, adequate porosity, excellent water holding capacity, and sufficient nutrient retention capacity can help repair the adverse effects of extreme weather events in the soil-plant system.

Geomorphic responses of fluvial systems to climate change: A habitat perspective	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Review						climate change; fluvial system; geomorphic response; global warming; habitat; species response	ALTERED FLOW REGIMES; EGG BURIAL DEPTHS; 2 DEGREES-C; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; CHANGE IMPACTS; FINE-SEDIMENT; SOIL-EROSION; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; WATER ECOSYSTEMS	Fluvial systems provide a variety of habitats that support thousands of species including many that are threatened or endangered. Moreover, these habitats, which range from aquatic and riparian to floodplain, are important for the variety of ecosystem services they provide. In addition to water temperature and streamflow change, geomorphic change is important and warrants consideration as one of the several potential threats to these habitats posed by climate change. The geomorphic response of fluvial systems to global warming in temperate environments, for example, caused by an increase in the frequency and magnitude of floods, is important because geomorphology is a primary determinant of habitat availability and quality. Possible geomorphic responses include increased erosion and (or) deposition in the river channel, riparian zone, and floodplain with associated habitat implications. Geomorphic changes caused by global warming can be beneficial (e.g., increased habitat complexity) or detrimental (e.g., mortality caused by scour or burial) to biota. The ability of a species to respond to and survive disturbances, including geomorphic changes, will depend on the nature of the disturbances and the sensitivity and adaptive capabilities of the species. Post-flood recovery often is rapid; however, for certain species (e.g., periphyton, macroinvertebrates), changes in community composition may persist. Increased flood frequency, sediment mobility, and associated geomorphic changes potentially will result in more frequent and persistent changes in habitat and community composition in the affected fluvial systems.

This work focuses on Iberian alder's climatic range (Alnus lusitanica Vit, Douda & Mandak). The Iberian Peninsula constitutes the Southwestern edge of the global chorological distribution of European black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. s.l.), and some of the warmest and driest conditions for the alder population are located in the center of Spain. The critical temperature-relevant periods that regulate the reproductive phenology of alder were analyzed using a statistical-based method for modeling chilling and forcing accumulation periods in temperate trees. Our results reveal that autumn chilling was the most important thermal accumulation period for alder in a Mediterranean climate while forcing requirements are satisfied in a short period of time. Autumn temperatures were significantly correlated with the timing of flowering, and chill units during this season directly influence start-dates of alder flowering. A positive trend was observed in pollen seasons' timing, meaning a slight delay of alder flowering in central Spain. It coincided with autumn warming during the period 2004-2018. If this warming trend continues, our results predict a delay in the start-date of flowering by around 3-days for every degree increase in maximum autumn temperatures according to the most optimistic emission scenarios.

Therefore, this article attempts to explore the impacts of CC on oil palm production in Malaysia and provides mitigation and adaptation strategies towards reducing such impacts. The multiple regression analysis is applied to assess the impacts of CC on oil palm production by using time series data in the period of 1980 to 2010. A negative and significant relationship is found between annual average temperature and oil palm production. If temperature rises by 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 4 degrees C, production of oil palm can decrease from a range of 10 to 41%. This article has also found a negative impact of sea level rise (SLR) on oil palm production. Findings reveal that if areas under oil palm production decrease by 2%, 4%, and 8% due to SLR of 0.5, 1, and 2 m, oil palm production can decrease by 1.98%, 3.96%, and 7.92%, respectively, indicating that CC has a significant impact on the reduction of oil palm production in Malaysia, ultimately affecting the sustainability of oil palm sector in Malaysia. Finally, this study suggests to practice appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including promotion and development of climate resilient varieties, soil and water conservation, afforestation, insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms, emission reduction technology, protection of coastal flooding for reducing the impacts of CC on oil palm production.

Here, we report on sediment records of eolian and fluvial interactions since the last glacial period, in the semiarid area of northwest China, at the limit of the Southeast Asian monsoon. Sediment sequences of last glacial and Holocene terraces of the Yellow River are composed of channel gravels, overlain by flood sands, eolian dunes, and flood loams. These sequences, dated by optically stimulated luminescence, record interlinks between fluvial and eolian processes and their response to climate change. Sedimentologic structures and grain-size analysis show flood loams, consisting of windblown sediment, deposited from floodwater suspended sediment. The gravel and sand were deposited during cold periods. During transitions from cold to warm phases, the river incised, and dunes were formed by deflation of channel and floodplain deposits (>70 and 21-16 ka). Dunes also formed at similar to 0.8 ka, probably after human intervention. After dune formation, flood loam covered dunes without erosion during peak discharges at the beginning of the subsequent warm period. The fluctuations of the Southeast Asian monsoon as a moisture-transporting agent have perhaps been the driving force for interactions between fluvial and eolian processes in this semiarid environment.

The results help inform companies/utilities seeking to incorporate climate change risk in their planning and decision-making processes by ranking risk severity and likelihood of occurrence on both a regional basis and by risk receptor. The assessment includes identification of potential risks to: (1) thermal generating, (2) hydroelectric, (3) land-based renewable generating, and (4) transmission and distribution assets. These risks may result from such projected changes as reduced water availability (e.g., for hydroelectric or once-through cooling), increased water temperatures (e.g., decrease in cooling efficiency, inability to meet discharge permit conditions), increased flood severity (e.g., increased streambank erosion and/or damage to river-adjacent infrastructure), and decreased water quality (e.g., from increased transport of sediment and dissolved solids). The potential risks identified from this qualitative risk-assessment are documented in a graphical format depicting both severity and likelihood. This approach allows for comparison of risks across a portfolio and for future prioritization of adaptation strategies. A total of 32 risks were identified in the study, including nine risks to infrastructure, six risks to operations, four risks to supply chain, and 13 environmental/regulatory risks.

Insurance against natural catastrophes: balancing actuarial fairness and social solidarity	GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Natural disasters; Actuarial fairness; Solidarity; Climate change; Flood; France	FLOOD INSURANCE; RISK; ECONOMICS; GERMANY	Natural disasters offer a specific case study of the mix of public and private insurance. Indeed, the experience accumulated over the past decades has made it possible to transform poorly-known hazards like flood losses, long considered uninsurable, into risks that can be assessed with some precision. They exemplify, however, the affordability issue associated with risk-based premiums. The French scheme reflects such ideas and offers wide coverage for moderate premiums to all, but is questioned in its principle by climate change: we show that some wealthier areas that were not perceived as 'at risk' in the past have now become exposed to submersion risk. This singularly makes some well-off properties the potential main beneficiaries of a scheme that was historically thought to protect the worst-off. Acknowledging that some segmentation may become desirable, we examine several models for flood risk and the disparity in premiums they entail.

Flood risk in many parts of the United States is projected to increase due to both continued floodplain development and climate change. Many of our institutions and public policies are not designed to address these changing risk conditions. The practice of grandfathering insurance premiums in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)-allowing an insured to keep a lower rate even when risk has increased-is one such policy. We link a flood hazard model to a flood insurance premium calculator in order to provide illustrative calculations of the possible impact of grandfathering on program revenue and policyholder premiums due to sea level rise for a New York City neighborhood. We conclude by discussing how to preserve the financial soundness of the NFIP while addressing the affordability of insurance in the face of increasing flood risk.

Many studies have examined which factors motivate individuals to adapt. However, a comprehensive overview of the key motivating factors of various adaptation behaviours is lacking. Here, we conduct a series of meta-analyses using data from 106 studies (90 papers) conducted in 23 different countries to examine how 13 motivational factors relate to various adaptation behaviours. Descriptive norms, negative affect, perceived self-efficacy and outcome efficacy of adaptive actions were most strongly associated with adaptive behaviour. In contrast, knowledge and experience, which are often assumed to be key barriers to adaptation, were relatively weakly related to adaptation. Research has disproportionally focused on studying experience and risk perception, flooding and hurricanes, and preparedness behaviours, while other motivational factors, hazards and adaptive behaviours have been understudied. These results point to important avenues for future research.

J	Jun, J; Song, MY				Jun, Jinhyun; Song, Minkyung			Study on the Redevelopment of the Hangang River Waterfront from an Urban Resilience Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban resilience; riverfront; waterfront; Hangang River; resilient by design challenge	HAN RIVER	Cities worldwide are developing strategies to cope with heat waves, extreme colds, floods, wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, pandemics, and other disasters caused by climate change. To this end, a resilience theory is being expanded and applied as a methodology to secure social and spatial systems that respond to climate change while providing ecological habitats and spaces for more diverse human activities. This study evaluated resilient redevelopment strategies for the Hangang River in Seoul by drawing on practices grounded in resilience theory. This study analyzed the nine proposals from the Resilience by Design Challenge, which aimed to gather response strategies for climate change in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2017 to identify practical physical design and social system strategies. Each team's strategy for implementing urban resilience focused on six categories: governance systems, financial planning, public engagement, accessibility, ecology, and diversity. The guidelines to consider during the redevelopment of the Hangang River in Seoul were formulated by applying these criteria to the review of the river. This process has also yielded the following implications and characteristics for resilient design. First, ensuring the resilience of a city necessitates prioritizing the resolution of regional imbalances. Second, the social and ecological resilience of cities is intricately intertwined. Moreover, comprehending the dynamics between the two can guide effective, resilient design. Third, resilient design's spatial and temporal scales are extensive and varied, highlighting the importance of understanding the relationships among categories and subcategories at different hierarchies. Finally, the value of urban waterfront space, traditionally associated with positive cultural and economic contributions to cities, must be reevaluated more profoundly and meaningfully in light of climate change.

Fate/ stability of these infrastructures due to extreme and abrupt change in precipitation, temperatures, humidity, and wind/airflow is quite questionable. Some of the issues related to climate change on soils include increase in infiltration rate, high pore-water pressure, decrease in effective stress, soil liquefaction, seepage failures, frost heaving, changes in soil suction potential, swelling and shrinkage in fine-grained soils, differential settlement, and damage to vegetation cover and thereby causing slope failures, waterlogged conditions, floods, soil erosion and/or internal erosion of fines, damage to landfill liners and soil covers, desertification, desiccation cracks on the ground surface, and groundwater table pollution due to contaminant migration. Therefore, studies on the impact of climate change on geotechnical infrastructures have gained attention of many researchers in the recent times. In present study, an up-to-date review of the works related to the influence of various climatic factors on geotechnical properties and thereby on geotechnical projects is carried out. Topics related to climate data downscaling using global climate models (GCM), climate change-induced slope instability, acid rains, desiccation cracking in soils with changing temperatures, impacts of dry-wet cycles and freeze-thaw cycles, and vegetation effects on soils are emphasized in this paper. Furthermore, to address the challenges, need-based research related to resilient infrastructures, thermo-hydro-mechanical models, bioremediation methods, innovative sustainable composite materials, and incorporation of climatic factors in design is highlighted and discussed.

However, historical impacts on European crop production associated with droughts, heatwaves, floods, and cold waves are not well understood-especially in view of potential adverse trends in the severity of impacts due to climate change. Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD. Using a compositing approach (superposed epoch analysis), we show that historical droughts and heatwaves reduced European cereal yields on average by 9% and 7.3%, respectively, associated with a wide range of responses (inter-quartile range +2% to -23%; +2% to -17%). Non-cereal yields declined by 3.8% and 3.1% during the same set of events. Cold waves led to cereal and non-cereal yield declines by 1.3% and 2.6%, while flood impacts were marginal and not statistically significant. Production losses are largely driven by yield declines, with no significant changes in harvested area. While all four event frequencies significantly increased over time, the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production roughly tripled over the last 50 years, from -2.2% (1964-1990) to -7.3% (1991-2015). Drought-related cereal production losses are shown to intensify by more than 3% yr(-1). Both the trend in frequency and severity can possibly be explained by changes in the vulnerability of the exposed system and underlying climate change impacts.

Gregory was a major contributor to fluvial palaeohydrological research. Beginning in the early 1980s, under his influence, rapid international growth of the discipline was accompanied by major advances in research methods and techniques. Current research emphases include applications of quantitative modelling and meta-analysis; the correlation of fluvial events to other records, notably palaeolacustine records; and methods for application to diverse issues of river engineering and management. The international expansion and detailed analyses of fluvial palaeohydrology are exemplified by recent studies done in Fennoscandia, the Mediterranean region, India, Israel, Australia, Pacific humid island arcs, and South America. Future developments will involve expanded work with other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, as well as applications to practical problems arising from future climatic change and related environmental hazards, particularly extremes. Remote sensing and high-resolution topography data and tools (e.g. LiDAR) will facilitate new discoveries of ancient exceptional flooding phenomena (megaflooding and superfloods) on Earth and on the palaeofluvial forms of Earth-like planets. New opportunities will also arise from the increased use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for analyses of 'big data'.

In this study questions about trends in data on damage from floods, debris flows and landslides are addressed and a potential connection to climate change is discussed. The data set of the Swiss flood and landslide damage database was normalised with three different approaches and trend tests were applied to yearly damage data from the period 1972-2016. Socio-economic developments including those related to population and wealth were accounted for. The normalisation of the nominal damage data resulted in much higher values in the earlier years of the study period, especially for high damage years. Total and mean damage were both around twice as high with normalisation. Around 71-75% of the total (nominal and normalised) damage was found to occur from June through August, and spatial analysis showed the highest damage in central Switzerland and along river reaches in the main Alpine valleys. The results indicated no statistically significant increase over time in yearly nominal damage data or in data normalised with any of the three approaches. Potential effects of climate change on damage data therefore were not detected.

Quantitative, indicator-based assessments are typically applied to evaluate resilience by combining various indicators of performance into a single composite index. Building upon extensive research on social vulnerability and coping/adaptive capacity, we first develop an original, comprehensive disaster resilience index (CDRI) at municipal level across Italy, to support the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. As next, we perform extensive sensitivity and robustness analysis to assess how various methodological choices, especially the normalisation and aggregation methods applied, influence the ensuing rankings. The results show patterns of social vulnerability and resilience with sizeable variability across the northern and southern regions. We propose several statistical methods to allow decision makers to explore the territorial, social and economic disparities, and choose aggregation methods best suitable for the various policy purposes. These methods are based on linear and non liner normalization approaches combining the OWA and LSP aggregators. Robust resilience rankings are determined by relative dominance across multiple methods. The dominance measures can be used as a decision-making benchmark for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management strategies and plans.

We show that New York CRE exposed to flood risk trades at a large, persistent discount. CRE in Boston, which mostly escaped direct hurricane-related damage, also exhibits persistent price penalties. These price effects are driven by asset-level capitalization rates, not building occupancy. Results from a placebo test using real estate prices in Chicago show that our inferences are not driven by coincidental, unrelated price trends for waterfront real estate assets.

This paper presents, for the first time, an attribution of this precipitation-induced flooding to anthropogenic climate change from a combined meteorological and hydrological perspective. Experiments were conducted with three observational datasets and two climate models to estimate changes in the extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the Brahmaputra basin up to the present and, additionally, an outlook to 2 degrees C warming since pre-industrial times. The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness of the attribution results to be assessed. In all three observational precipitation datasets the climate change trends for extreme precipitation similar to that observed in August 2017 are not significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this insignificant trend is positive. One climate model ensemble shows a significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the other large ensemble model simulates a cancellation between the increase due to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and a decrease due to sulfate aerosols. Considering discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less uncertain than in precipitation, but the 95 % confidence intervals still encompass no change in risk. Extending the analysis to the future, all models project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2 degrees C global heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7 times more likely for high 10-day precipitation and being more likely by a factor of about 1.5 for discharge. Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the Brahmaputra event of August 2017 is derived by synthesizing the observational and model results: we find the change in risk to be greater than 1 and of a similar order of magnitude (between 1 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach. This study shows that, for precipitation-induced flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as an alternative when hydrological models are not available or as an additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions. Besides this, it highlights the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols.

Using evidence from a coastal community, we pose a question: Do people factor in warnings by scientists and governments about sea level rise when making their investment decisions? Using a difference-in-differences framework, we examine if disclosure of future risks affects coastal property prices. New Zealand's Kapiti Coast published detailed projections of coastal erosion in 2012 and was forced to remove them by the courts in 2014. Results indicate posting of this information had an insignificant impact on prices, suggesting people do not factor in long-term risks of sea level rise, as future risks are not capitalized in prices.

Phenotypic variation from waterlogging in multiple perennial ryegrass varieties under climate change conditions	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						anthocyanins; chamber experiment; colors; flooding; grasslands; harvest; image analysis; Lolium perenne	LOLIUM-PERENNE; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; PHOSPHORUS DEFICIENCY; STRESS RESPONSES; MODEL SELECTION; ELEVATED CO2; ROOT-GROWTH; UV-B; GRASSLAND; L.	Identifying how various components of climate change will influence ecosystems and vegetation subsistence will be fundamental to mitigate negative effects. Climate change-induced waterlogging is understudied in comparison to temperature and CO2. Grasslands are especially vulnerable through the connection with global food security, with perennial ryegrass dominating many flood-prone pasturelands in North-western Europe. We investigated the effect of long-term waterlogging on phenotypic responses of perennial ryegrass using four common varieties (one diploid and three tetraploid) grown in atmospherically controlled growth chambers during two months of peak growth. The climate treatments compare ambient climatological conditions in North-western Europe to the RCP8.5 climate change scenario in 2050 (+2 degrees C and 550 ppm CO2). At the end of each month multiple phenotypic plant measurements were made, the plants were harvested and then allowed to grow back. Using image analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) methodologies, we assessed how multiple predictors (phenotypic, environmental, genotypic, and temporal) influenced overall plant performance, productivity and phenotypic responses. Long-term waterlogging was found to reduce leaf-color intensity, with younger plants having purple hues indicative of anthocyanins. Plant performance and yield was lower in waterlogged plants, with tetraploid varieties coping better than the diploid one. The climate change treatment was found to reduce color intensities further. Flooding was found to reduce plant productivity via reductions in color pigments and root proliferation. These effects will have negative consequences for global food security brought on by increased frequency of extreme weather events and flooding. Our imaging analysis approach to estimate effects of waterlogging can be incorporated into plant health diagnostics tools via remote sensing and drone-technology.

Adaptation of river channels to a wetter or drier climate: Insights from the Lower Pilcomayo River, South America	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Alluvial river; Pilcomayo river; Climate change; Floodplain vegetation; River morphodynamics	SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; FLOOD RISK; MORPHOLOGY; DYNAMICS; EROSION; LANDSCAPES; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; IMPACT	Climate change has a direct influence on both hydrology and floodplain vegetation of water courses, which are key players in river morphodynamics. The river system response to climate change is complex and the effects of non-linear interactions between alterations in water, sediment and vegetation remain incompletely understood. Which of these components becomes dominant in shaping the river channel when climate becomes drier or wetter? To answer this question, we investigate the cross-sectional response of sand-bed rivers to climate change focusing on channel width and depth, which respond directly to changes in boundary stresses. Thanks to the exceptional availability of long time-series of daily discharge and cross-sectional profiles, the Pilcomayo River is an ideal living lab for this investigation. We constructed a two-dimensional model of the river using the open -source state-of-the-art, structured Delft3D code. The highly dynamic behaviour and quick morphological adaptation of the Pilcomayo allowed reducing the period of time covered by the simulations because the river cross-section adapts its morphology to a new value of the water discharge within hours or days, which is crucial for modelling investigations. Calibration and validation were successfully performed by comparison with his-torical data. We considered several scenarios representing current, dryer and wetter climates. The results show that a dryer climate reduces the river channel depth and enlarges the width. A wetter climate increases the channel depth but produces negligible widening. Vegetation, sparser with a drier climate and denser with a wetter climate, is found to control the channel width. This analysis is unique and shows which alterations can be expected in alluvial sand-bed rivers with natural vegetated banks due to climate change.	[Crosato, A.; Grissetti-Vazquez, A.; Franca, M.

Climate change risks and second home planning	TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES			English	Article						Climate scenarios; coastal tourism; coastal transformation; mitigation; strategy	2ND-HOME TOURISM	Second homes are essential resources for tourism and recreation. Climate change is projected to transform tourism geographies and threaten economic and recreational activities. Based on building and housing register data and national models for climate change hazards, this paper investigates whether second homes in Denmark are potentially affected. Five different hazards are used to describe climate risk based on the RCP8.5 scenario: sea level rise, storm surge events, coastal erosion, flooding from watercourses, and terrestrial groundwater. It is estimated that between 2020 and 2070 a significant number of second homes will potentially be affected by one or more of these hazards, with terrestrial groundwater being the most frequent. GIS-analysis shows the detailed geographical distribution of the affected second homes, while regional grouping highlights the most affected regions. A compound risk analysis demonstrates that a significant proportion (approximately 25%) of the Danish second homes will be affected by either one or more hazards. The analysis thereby highlights how amenity rich geographies are threatened by climate change, which could cause these areas to become risk prone. This provides a background for discussing the implications for land use policy of transforming geographies. The article highlights a need for strategic planning and active engagement with second to protect the recreational potential of second homes and local economies in coastal zones.

In Part I, a survey on disasters and national transfers to 45 Brazilian municipalities is presented. In Part II, the local-scale approach enabled to compare the areas most affected by COVID-19 with those impacted by climate change. There are large uncertainties around financial support from the federal government and their impact at local scale. Sao Paulo city was chosen because it reveals some important aspects of spatial structure carried out through local investments. In this sense, updated information on floods and warmer surfaces were updated to provoke a discussion about a potential confluence with the effects of pandemic. The results highlighted the effects of scarce federal transfers and the maps help us to identify the spatial distribution of people at risk, which can be beneficial for municipal decisions as they highlight a significative relationship between pandemic effects and an uneven social structure. In conclusion, the trade-off between this unequal structure and a necessary and effectively sustainable change leads us to reflect on local investment trends.

Amid many hindrances, poor governance has been identified as one of the most pressing reasons for ineffective action to tackle multifaceted and integrative climate-water issues in Pakistan. This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects. In conclusion, a four-dimensional governance strategy, encompassing leadership, policy, institutions, and stakeholders is proposed to improve water sector resilience and adaptation to combat climate change in Pakistan.

Often, the worst affected groups are those living in low-income settlements located in floodplains of the city. Maxaquene A is an example of such a settlement in Maputo, Mozambique, a country with a strong history of storms and floods due to its geographical location. This paper describes a rapid flood risk assessment conducted by the authors, in Maxaquene A. The assessment obtained both community and external stakeholder perceptions of challenges in the neighbourhood, accompanied by a description of how floods have affected infrastructure such as drainage and sanitation, services such as pit emptying and solid waste collection, and localised infrastructure solutions developed by the community as a coping mechanism. The assessment highlighted the need for collaboration with community members to co-develop appropriate flood risk management strategies and infrastructure solutions. This work will pave the way for greater in-depth research with residents of Maxaquene A, neighbouring settlements in Maputo and other informal settlements in the Global South, to drive change in climate change adaptation across the built environment.

One of the most serious repercussions of climate change, which threatens many coastal areas globally, is the sea-level rise. To deepen understanding of this phenomenon and its related impacts, several models have recently been developed to satisfy the unique needs of coastal zone management. These models are very useful because of their visualization and prediction capabilities as they aid in decision-making regarding the adaptation of current protected area investments. This review, therefore, provides evidence of the potential and effectiveness of recent mapping models for managing the effects of sea-level rise. This study examined current models for mapping flood risk areas as a result of sea-level rise. It also provides guidelines to help coastal zone managers and policymakers decide the applicability of various models at local, regional, and global scales. There is no universally accepted model, and each of the models reviewed in this paper has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the models provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are commonly used by organizations and others. These models are more accessible and comprehensible for scientists and individuals with limited scientific background knowledge on sea-level rise.

Following the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 3226 publications were selected for this bibliometric analysis. From the selected publications, the top journals were identified according to number of publications and number of citations, as well as the authors with the highest number of publications. It has been found that publication rate on RWH has been increasing steadily since 2005. Water (MDPI) journal has published the highest number of publications (128). Based on the literature considered in this review, the top five authors are found as Ghisi, E., Han, M., Rahman, A., Butler, D. and Imteaz, M.A. in that order. With respect to research collaborations, the top performing countries are USA-China, USA-Australia, USA-UK, Australia-UK and Australia-China. Although, the most dominant keywords are found to be 'rain', 'rainwater', 'water supply' and 'rainwater harvesting', since 2016, a higher emphasis has been attributed to 'floods', 'efficiency', 'climate change', 'performance assessment' and 'housing'. It is expected that RWH research will continue to rise in future following the current trends as it is regarded as a sustainable means of water cycle management.

J	Jiang, WZ; Tan, Y				Jiang, Weizhen; Tan, Yong			Overview on failures of urban underground infrastructures in complex geological conditions due to heavy rainfall in China during 1994-2018	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Underground infrastructure; Failure; Heavy rainfall; Database; China	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; LANDSLIDES; FLOODS	Currently, global warming is increasing rainfall intensities worldwide, particularly in China. This climate change has caused numerous underground infrastructure failures, which threatens the sustainable development of urban environments. Most failures brought about secondary hazards in densely populated areas, which often caused massive damages and casualties and/or injuries. Thus, a summary of such failures and their contributing factors on a national scale is essential for understanding the adverse influences of climate change on infrastructures, which can help urban planners, designers and engineers to improve city resilience. In this paper, an overview of 378 underground infrastructure failures in China associated with heavy rainfall was conducted. First, the latest rainfall characteristics in China were analyzed. Then, a review was conducted in four aspects, i.e., infrastructure types, involved strata, and temporal and geographic distributions. Finally, contributing factors of the failures were discussed. Several major findings were obtained: (1) the failure numbers had increased significantly since 2010, mainly attributed to the intensification of rainfall in rapidly urbanizing regions; (2) the resilience of underground infrastructures against heavy rainfall is governed by the performance of existing drainage facilities nearby; and (3) more failures clustered in the urban environments featuring highly concentrated rainfalls and thick-layered unsaturated coarse-grained soils.

Impacts on surface water and groundwater resources and water-related illnesses are increasing, especially under changing climate scenarios such as diversity in rainfall patterns, increasing temperature, flash floods, severe droughts, heatwaves and heavy precipitation. Emerging water-related diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya are reappearing and impacting on the life of the deprived; as such, the provision of safe water and health care is in great demand in developing countries to combat the spread of infectious diseases. Government, academia and private water bodies are conducting water quality surveys and providing health care facilities, but there is still a need to improve the present strategies concerning water treatment and management, as well as governance. In this review paper, climate change pattern and risks associated with water-related diseases in developing countries, with particular focus on Pakistan, and novel methods for controlling both waterborne and water-related diseases are discussed. This study is important for public health care, particularly in developing countries, for policy makers, and researchers working in the area of climate change, water quality and risk assessment.

Our research builds on a consolidated risk and vulnerability framework targeting both disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) while integrating the consolidated risk approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Furthermore, our research advances current methodologies by applying a spatially explicit and indicator-based approach, which allows the targeted and place-specific identification of intervention options-independent from the spatial bias of administrative units. The flooding CRVA is based on a comprehensive list of 14 primary indicators and 35 socio-economic sub-indicators. Our results indicate that high levels of socio-economic vulnerability related to flooding are concentrated in the northern and eastern regions of Austria. When integrating a climate hazard proxy, statistically significant risk hotspots (>90% confidence) can be identified in central-northern Austria and towards the east. Furthermore, we established a typology of regions following a spatially enabled clustering approach. Finally, our research provides a successful operationalization of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) risk framework in combination with enhanced spatial analysis methods.

Socio-economic conditions and small business vulnerability to climate change impacts in Hong Kong	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Small business; vulnerability; climate change; flooding; adaptation; China	CHANGE ADAPTATION; TAI O; RESILIENCE; TOURISM; MANAGEMENT; FLOODS; RISK; PERCEPTIONS; ENTERPRISES; AFTERMATH	Small and micro businesses bear the brunt of climate change impacts in the climate-challenged economy. Vulnerability is embedded into the socio-economic trajectories of their primary decision-makers. Multiple vulnerabilities may arise if the decision-makers' socio-economic conditions are associated with climate-sensitive business characteristics. Previous research has provided little evidence on such linkages, thus losing insights into how different facets of vulnerability interact and evolve over time. This paper explores the interactions between elements of small business vulnerability and the socio-economic characteristics of their primary decision-makers. It draws on the results of a survey involving 116 owner-managers of small and micro businesses and in-depth interviews with a sub-sample. Study areas are three remote coastal communities in Hong Kong exposed to high floods. Results show that such interactions exist in multiple, non-linear ways. Socio-economic disadvantages (i.e. low education attainment, old age, low income, and female) are related to some aspects of small business vulnerability, while playing a role in mitigating or avoiding other aspects of it. The findings call for building frameworks that account for the multiple spheres in which vulnerabilities are engendered and their interactions, while allowing for complexities and feedback mechanisms.

This paper examines rice farmers' vulnerability, adaptation strategies, and adaptation barriers to managing climate change impacts in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 220 randomly selected rice farmers located across two coastal districts of Bangladesh. A multinomial logit model was applied to analyze determinants of adaptation strategies of rice farmers. The results reveal that flood is the main risk to vulnerability, followed by cyclones and storms surges and saline intrusion. The main adaptation strategies are cultivating flood and salinity tolerant rice varieties, direct seeding of rice, supplementary irrigation, cultivation of non-rice crops that have shorter growth duration, and rearing of livestock, poultry, and duck. The econometric analysis shows that factors such as household head's education, household income, farm size, access to information, and extension services significantly influence the choice of adaptation strategies of the rice farmers. We recommend to increase investment in research, training of farmers, and targeted extension services to disseminate climate-smart technologies and information for minimising vulnerability of the farmers.

We develop a two-part conceptual framework linking social-ecological resilience to adaptation outcomes in NbS. Part one determines the potential of NbS to support resilience based on assessing whether NbS affect key mechanisms known to enable resilience. Examples include social-ecological diversity, connectivity, and inclusive decision-making. Part two includes adaptation outcomes that building social-ecological resilience can sustain, known as nature's contributions to adaptation (NCAs). We apply the framework to a global dataset of NbS in forests. We find evidence that NbS may be supporting resilience by influencing many enabling mechanisms. NbS also deliver many NCAs such as flood and drought mitigation. However, there is less evidence for some mechanisms and NCAs critical for resilience to long-term uncertainty. We present future research questions to better understand how NbS can continue to support social-ecological systems in a changing world.

Impact of flooding and inundation on concrete pavement performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING			English	Article						Climate change; flooding; concrete pavement; rigid pavement; jointed plain concrete pavement; pavement design; damage		Pavement infrastructures have become vulnerable to damage as they were not designed to withstand the aggressions of extreme weather events such as flooding, induced by climate change. In Ontario, flooding tops the list of climate change hazards having a consequential impact on pavement performance. Rigid pavements are recorded to provide resilience to flood hazard in literature but knowledge about its behavior and response to flood impact is currently scarce. The objective of this study is to investigate flood impact on concrete pavement performance examining case studies of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP) road classes in Ontario. The AASHTOWare Pavement ME was employed to simulate JPCP performance under climate-induced flood scenarios using a conservative Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 4.5W/m(2). Typical municipal JPCP collector and arterial road classes were chosen and modelled. While percentage change in faulting performance was considered, overall flood damage was based on relative change in International Roughness Index (IRI) under flood conditions.

Most developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change due to their economic circumstances. As such, they are often less able to implement adaptation strategies to reduce climate-related impact. Based on this, this study deals with the risk, vulnerability and adaptive measures in the case of sudden disasters (i.e. heavy floods and tsunami) by applying the disaster vulnerability approach, using a case study in Malaysia. This study applies three basic indicators of climatic disasters' impact and issues -(i) flood disaster vulnerability (Omega); (ii) flood disaster magnitude (Pi); and (iii) integration of adaptive flood risk management () using public risk perception of climate disasters and flood prevention strategies. Following the findings, this study proposes procedural and theoretical frameworks which are comparatively new to the research of climate threats (climate change, variability and disasters). Additionally, it offers decision makers' valuable insights which may assist in promoting greater awareness of flood risk management, in both Malaysia and other communities facing similar climate threats and disaster trends.

However, most current research addresses resilience and climate adaptation at either the national or the household scale; very little is known about community-scale interventions. We interviewed 934 community members in six communities in southeastern Nigeria about sources of climate risk and community-based actions for climate change adaptation. We found these communities contained multiple active and engaged groups that have implemented a wide range of interventions to reduce climate risk, most of which are seen as effective by community members. Flooding was the most common form of risk in this region, but drought, windstorms, and irregular rainy seasons are also frequent, implying that effective climate adaptation will have to be sensitive to multiple types of risk. Structural interventions (constructing roads, bridges, etc.) were the most common type of intervention, suggesting that communities are capable of marshalling considerable organizational and human power for adaptation efforts, even in the absence of external assistance. Efforts to boost community resilience and adaptation to climate change would benefit from first understanding what community actions are currently underway, and working with the groups implementing these actions to support and extend them.

Hydrological changes in the drought-prone region of Maharashtra (India): Implications for sustainable water use	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						rainfall; surface water; groundwater; runoff coefficient; potential evapotranspiration (PET); climate change	MONSOON RAINFALL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; BASIN; MANAGEMENT; EVENTS	Recent climatic changes and anthropogenic activities considerably affect regional water resources, particularly in water-scarce regions. The present study, therefore, aims to understand the changes in monsoon rainfall, potential evapotranspiration (PET), surface runoff, dam storage and groundwater in the drought-prone region of Maharashtra. The analyses of trend and step-change were carried out using standard parametric tests. The results were verified with the application of non-parametric statistical techniques. Notably, monsoon rainfall and runoff were observed to be declining. Exceptionally, the Yerala Basin witnessed significant increase in rainfall along with heavy rainfall events. Contradictorily, Agrani and Man Basins registered a notable decline in rainfall and runoff. As vulnerability to hydrological disasters is high, these basins should be carefully monitored. Although surface water harvesting brought a positive change in post-monsoon groundwater level, it was the main reason for a decline in runoff volume at downstream reaches, which led to intra-basin water disparity. The study area witnessed significant increase in groundwater extraction. Unfortunately, the misuse of government-subsidized schemes exacerbates groundwater exploitation and stockpiling of water resources. Moreover, the increasing rate of PET augments hydrological losses and amplifies water distress. Interestingly, almost all the hydrological changes were notably experienced during the post-2000 period. To cope with present and future water scarcity problems, it is therefore necessary to restrict irrational use and allocation of available limited water resources. The findings that emerge from this investigation may help to formulate judicious water policies and plans which could be implemented by the government, agronomists, water resource managers and farmers.

Climate change could increase the level of compound flood hazard through higher extreme sea levels and river flows. Here, a bivariate flood hazard assessment method is proposed to estimate compound coastal-riverine frequency under current and future climate conditions. A copula-based approach is used to estimate the joint return period (JRP) of compound floods by incorporating sea-level rise (SLR) and changes in peak river flows into the marginal distributions of flood drivers. Specifically, the changes in JRP of compound major coastal-riverine flooding defined based on simultaneous exceedances above major coastal and riverine thresholds, are explored by midcentury. Subsequently, the increase in the probability of occurrence of at least one compound major coastal-riverine flooding for a given period of time is quantified. The proposed compound flood hazard assessment is conducted at 26 paired tidal-riverine stations along the Contiguous United States coast with long-term data and defined flood thresholds. We show that the northeast Atlantic and the western part of the Gulf coasts are experiencing the highest compound major coastal-riverine flood probability under current conditions. However, future SLR scenarios show the highest frequency amplification along the southeast Atlantic coast. The impact of changes in peak river flows is found to be considerably less than that of SLR. Climate change impacts, especially SLR, may lead to more frequent compound events, which cannot be ignored for future adaptation responses in estuary regions.

Advanced understanding of the future long-term coevolution of coupled urban human-water systems is of considerable interest in this context. This study uses a previously developed sociohydrologic model to explore the coevolutionary trajectories of Beijing City's human-water system over the 2015-2099 period under possible climate changes. The effects of multiple human adaptive actions under alternative climate scenarios are investigated in particular. Results show that there might be a recurrent competition for water between humans and the natural environment (e.g., groundwater aquifer) in the long-term future, indicating that effective water management needs to ensure that this competition remains within a safe operating space. Three regimes of the human-environment competition are revealed, including a sustainable development regime in which human society and groundwater aquifer are both safe throughout their coevolutionary trajectories, a regime that may lead to severe population loss due to overaggressive population control actions, and a regime that may cause aquifer depletion due to under-perception of the drawdown of groundwater table. Results also show that relying too much on interbasin water diversion project might slacken human water conservation measures and eventually cause more severe aquifer depletion in the long run. Maintaining a high community sensitivity to drawdown of groundwater table and moderate measures to control population growth are keys to avoid unintended, negative consequences.

Tectonic and Paleoclimatic Setting for Hominin Evolution in Eastern Africa	ELEMENTS			English	Article						plateau uplift; paleoclimate; hydrology; geodynamics; eastern Africa; rift	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; TANZANIA; PATTERNS; UPLIFT	As dynamic processes in the Earth's mantle stretch and thin large sectors of the African plate, broad plateaus interrupted by deep valleys and flanking mountains have formed at the Earth's surface. These vertical and horizontal crustal movements occur concurrent with global climate changes, both of which happen over diverse spatial and temporal scales. Together, they modulated eastern Africa's habitats for early hominins, and for flora and fauna in general. The habitat for hominin evolution, therefore, is shaped by bottomup and top-down processes. Broad plateau uplift in Ethiopia had initiated by 30 Ma, coincident with or after flood magmatism at 45 Ma when dry seasonal woodland environments initiated in eastern Africa. The fossil-rich sedimentary sequences partially filling the 30-70-km-wide rift basins record the history of human evolution, as well as the complex interplay between climate change, uplift, volcanism, and faulting in equatorial Africa. The lake shorelines and hydrothermal systems served as oases for hunter-gatherers, and the rough topography of the faulted landscape may have served as refugia. Here, we outline the relevant time-space patterns to establish the geodynamic and paleoclimatic context for human evolution in eastern Africa.

The focus is on representation of climate (response) information in a form that provides sufficient clarity in the midst of uncertainty for end-users who are seeking to develop or maintain resilient infrastructure. The paper recommends that the use of the term climate services in situations unrelated to supporting adaptation to and mitigation of climate change should be avoided. Better investment decisions could be made if Bayesian frameworks were used to assign probabilities to RCP scenarios. Associated predictions need to cover all types of climate change influences not just sea level rise and ideally provide concurrent time series to allow evaluation of dependencies. Guidance on climate information published by official bodies needs to adopt a consistent approach, with a clear narrative that describes the transition from science to guidance. The form in which climate services information is needed for the required end user decisions needs careful thought, including appropriate communication of the associated uncertainties using good practices and experiences from related sectors.</p>	[Simm, Jonathan; Gouldby, Ben; Lumbroso, Darren; Matthewson, Tom] HR Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, England	HR Wallingford Limited	Simm, J (corresponding author), HR Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, England.	j.simm@hrwallingford.com							31	6	6	2	4	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		2296-7745		FRONT MAR SCI	Front.

The collection contains articles on wetland resilience to climate change, agricultural land use-driven change, and recreational land use, along with evaluations of wetland resilience through high-resolution monitoring and modeling tools. Wetland settings in the U.S. span tidal marshes and coastal plain non-riverine wetlands in North Carolina, prairie potholes in Iowa, Appalachian floodplain wetlands, and floating treatment wetlands in the Midwest. The studies in this collection found vertical accretion rates of 0.7 to 4.0 mm year-1 in a tidal marsh, a wide range of potential wetland hydroperiod responses to climate change, substantial decreases in inundation period, crop yield, and surface-water nitrate (but increases in phosphorus) in artificially drained potholes, and nitrate removal in carbon-amended floating treatment wetlands. Further work is needed to better understand how to design and enhance wetland systems in agricultural regions, better preserve wetland ecosystem services in areas affected by land use and climate change, and provide technical standards for the wide range of designs currently used for wetland treatment systems.

J	Singh, N; Chinnasamy, P				Singh, Neetu; Chinnasamy, Pennan			Non-stationary flood frequency analysis and attribution of streamflow series: a case study of Periyar River, India	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						non-stationarity; flood frequency analysis; return period; climate change; urbanization; Indian floods	CHANGE-POINT ANALYSIS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RETURN PERIOD; R PACKAGE; TREND; RISK; EVENTS; KERALA	The occurrence of extreme hydrological flood events has become frequent recently, especially in India. Flood analysis methods need to capture variations in trends and identify key factors causing this variation. Non-stationary flood frequency analysis is one of the few methods that can account for these variations. In this study, the non-stationarity of Periyar River discharge was investigated through the flood frequency analysis of one stationary and 12 non-stationary models, produced using a generalized extreme value distribution with annual precipitation, urban extent and time as a linear function of its location and scale parameter. The analysis found that both climate change and anthropogenic activities are responsible for the non-stationarity of the Periyar River discharge. Also, the 50-year return level of the stationary model was found to be equal to the 39-year return level of the optimal non-stationary model, thus, the assumption of stationarity may lead to the unsafe design of structures.

Willingness to pay to avoid flooding in Cuttack, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban flooding; Hedonic price; Drainage infrastructure; Climate change adaptation; India	URBAN HOUSING-MARKET; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; CITY; MITIGATION; IMPACTS; URBANIZATION; DETERMINANTS; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT	Flooding is a frequent natural disaster, which is predicted to intensify over time because of climate change. As more than half the world lives in urban spaces, flooding could devastate urban populations, especially if the infrastructure to cope with flooding is inadequate. We study flooding in Cuttack, Odisha, a typical Indian city subject to annual flooding. We present estimates from a lower and lower-middle income country of household willingness to pay (WTP) for improved urban drainage using a revealed preference method. We use a hedonic price model to estimate WTP across city zones with differential exposure to flooding. At 2014-15 prices, a typical flood (approximately 7 hours per day on average) reduces the annual rental value by INR1352 (US$ 21) or about 4.4% annually. This implies that Cuttack households are willing to pay INR 188 million (or $ 2.9 million) to avoid flooding. Our findings have implications for urban sustainability and the financing of public infrastructure to reduce flooding in low and lower-middle-income countries.

This study utilized remote sensing technology, specifically the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), to assess terrestrial water storage (TWS) and its response to climate variability within the Volta Basin. The methodology involved integrating GRACE data with ground-based measurements, climate models, and other satellite observations to enhance the accuracy of TWS assessment. Despite numerous studies conducted within the basin, this research employed additional statistical techniques such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It also utilized Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) to determine variations in TWS and climate variability observed within the Volta Basin. The results provide valuable insights into TWS dynamics, highlighting the complex interplay between precipitation patterns, groundwater storage, and surface water availability. Also, it was revealed that rainfall signals were strongest in the northernmost part of the basin, reaching a maximum value of 10 mm, while the lowest value of 5.5 mm was recorded in the southern part of the basin. Similarly, TWS signals were highest in the northern and lowest in the southern part of the basin, exhibiting values related to that of rainfall. Additionally, the highest TWS value of 250 mm was identified between 2010 and 2012. The increase in TWS during this period correlates with the occurrence of La Nina that happened between 2010 and 2012. This study offers essential information for water resource management, drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and climate change adaptation strategies not only within the Volta Basin but also in other basins across the globe.

J	Mondal, TK				Mondal, Tarun Kumar			Assessing the scope for promoting climate resilient agriculture in the Indian Sundarban Delta: A SWOT-AHP analysis	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Climate change; Climate resilient agriculture; Integrated farming; Organic farming; Sundarban delta; SWOT-AHP	ORGANIC AGRICULTURE; SMART AGRICULTURE; SECURITY; FARMERS; SYSTEMS	The Sundarban delta region, a unique coastal ecosystem is highly vulnerable to climate change threats such as sea level rise, cyclonic storms, floods, tidal surges and coastal erosion. Extreme poverty and hunger, limited livelihood options and economic backwardness lead to miserable life for the rural poor in this estuarine and coastal environment. Agriculture is the main economic activity in this region with low productivity and high exposure to climate change. To overcome these challenges, farmers are practicing various strategies such as adoption of integrated farming, organic farming, diversified and floating agriculture, crop rotation, salt resistance varieties, indigenous seed banks and rainwater harvesting to promote climate resilient agriculture (CRA). In this context, an attempt has been made in this paper to analyse the challenges and opportunities of CRA in the Indian Sundarban delta. This study is mainly based on primary data collected from Sagar, Gosaba and Patharpratima C.D. Blocks in this delta and 60 households from each C.D. Block, altogether 180 households have been surveyed. The SWOT-AHP has been applied to analyse the scope for promoting CRA in the study area. This study has found that the overall scores of positive factors (i.e. strengths and opportunities) are considerably higher than the negative factors (i.e. weaknesses and threats) for promoting CRA. An effective policy to strengthen CRA, particularly focusing on integrated farming, organic farming and rainwater harvesting in the study area is needed to sustain agriculture, rural livelihoods as well as management of Sundarban coastal ecosystem.

J	Sadeghi, N				Sadeghi, Nazanin			Continuity of small businesses when facing increased flood risk due to global climate change impacts: A systematic literature review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Small businesses continuity; Flood; Systematic review; Bibliometric analysis; HistCite	MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; DISASTER RECOVERY; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; SMES; VULNERABILITY; PREPAREDNESS; ADAPTATION; RELOCATION; FRAMEWORK	Floods are amongst the costliest disasters resulting from human-induced climate change. Small businesses, as the backbone of many economies, are both most affected by and more vulnerable to floods compared to large businesses. Viable small businesses have the potential to contribute to the recovery of communities affected by floods because of their close links. However, the survival of small businesses and their role in community resilience in times of climate change induced dis-asters is under-researched. This study addresses this gap by undertaking a systematic literature review of papers in these literatures from 1982 to 2021. The review finds small businesses poli-cies to deal with floods can be categorized into four research themes as follows: business continu-ity procedures; adaptation measures; resilience frameworks; and recovery efforts. Reviewing these four research themes, key findings are identified as follows. There is limited research into how small businesses respond to flood risk. The small business literature considers natural disas-ters overall and does not distinguish between specific kinds of disasters. The impact of flood on a small business varies according to their nature, geographic location and is highly context depen-dent. The number of studies investigating small businesses' coping strategies post-flooding has in-creased since 2019 because of their significant economic role in developed countries. The small business literature has mostly focused on business survival not the role of small business in the community, and hence, this paper has attempted to also contribute to identifying research direc-tions and implications from both practical and theoretical aspects.

The inter-governmental panel of climate change (IPCC) has discussed its adverse impacts worldwide and has restricted its extraction. This article has mooted some of its potential threats and remedies to combat climate change and other social issues associated with the brick industry. Bricks made of clay are commonly used as a building material for masonry works in densely populated South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. To make clay bricks, the topsoil of the floodplain area where most agriculture productivity is carried out is utilized in millions of tons every year. The main drawbacks of topsoil removal are the depletion of the seed bank, removing soil biota, and diminishing soil properties and functions. Furthermore, the process often involves burning firewood as emitting fuel CO2, SO2, NO2, and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Thus, the clay brick-making industry contributes to greenhouse gases directly affecting soil fertility. The primary focus of this review article is to promote research on flyash-based bricks for the brick industry and provide safe and cost-effective sustainable materials to substitute clay bricks. This review article presents the worldwide production of clay bricks and their harmful impact on the environment. The current and future scenarios on flyash, systematic literature review (SLR) on flyash-based bricks, the practical utility of clay and flyash-based bricks, and issues and opportunities were also discussed. The findings obtained from the past published studies on flyash-based bricks give an insight to the researchers. The review article also presents the prospects for researchers and designers.

The original version of Marxan does not consider risk and uncertainty associated with threatening processes affecting protected areas, including uncertainty about the location and condition of species' populations and habitats now and in the future. We described and examined the functionality of a modified version of Marxan, Marxan with Probability. This software explicitly considers 4 types of uncertainty: probability that a feature exists in a particular place (estimated based on species distribution models or spatially explicit population models); probability that features in a site will be lost in the future due to a threatening process, such as climate change, natural catastrophes, and uncontrolled human interventions; probability that a feature will exist in the future due to natural successional processes, such as a fire or flood; and probability the feature exists but has been degraded by threatening processes, such as overfishing or pollution, and thus cannot contribute to conservation goals. We summarized the results of 5 studies that illustrate how each type of uncertainty can be used to inform protected area design. If there were uncertainty in species or habitat distribution, users could maximize the chance that these features were represented by including uncertainty using Marxan with Probability. Similarly, if threatening processes were considered, users minimized the chance that species or habitats were lost or degraded by using Marxan with Probability. Marxan with Probability opens up substantial new avenues for systematic conservation planning research and application by agencies.

However, at a global level, there is little statistical data about small cities, and their numbers and locations are thus so far unknown. In this paper, five cases of small coastal cities, two of which are located in the USA -Miami Beach and Milford -and three, in Australia (Mandurah), Bangladesh (Sundarbans), and South Africa (Knysna) respectively, are presented and discussed in view of adaptation to climate change. All cases reported vulnerability to sea level rise, with impacts compounded by increasing storminess (and even hurricanes of increasing intensity), tides, inland flooding and loss of natural habitat. Changes in precipitation resulted in both reduced river flow, leading to sediment deficits and coastal erosion (from the sea) or increased river flow with similar damage (from the land). Adaptation response was most clearly delineated along lines of development status with wealthier, more highly developed cities pursuing more technologically advanced solutions, whilst the two cities of the Global South focused more on governance and capacity building solutions. Also, it was clear from the Knysna case that if a city or municipality lacks the capacity to effectively respond with adaptation measures, local private wealth may dominate and result in haphazard adaptation responses to the detriment of regional adaptation planning efforts. While this paper provides a first step in establishing a richer understanding, it is clear that more case studies across global regions and economic categories are required to deepen our understanding of climate change adaptation planning in small cities.

The DPSIR method is here used taking into account processes and cause/effect relationship between Drivers and Pressures, which induce an alteration of actual State and, hence, Impacts on the environment, society and economy. The study area is located in South Italy (Apulia region), where the Risk Index is calculated and mapped for all municipalities facing the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Both coastal Vulnerability and Exposure Indexes are firstly calculated according to the procedure suggested in the EUrosion project (EU model) as the product of specific indicators describing the state of coastal zones, their natural characteristics and both natural and anthropic pressures. Based on both EU model results and knowledge of states and pressures of the study area, a new modified model is then proposed (Mod.E.M.) and final risk maps compared. The comparison shows that new Vulnerability and Exposure indexes better describe the ongoing coastal processes and pressures and allow us to identify hot-spot sites where more detailed analyses could be further focused on. The Mod.E.M. has more than just a local significance since the case study includes coastal areas with so different characteristics, that it can be easily applied to other coastal regions. Moreover, to take into account climate change effects, Risk Index is evaluated under Representative Concentration PathwaysRCP4.5andRCP8.5, mainly affecting the sea level rise and the storm surge level.

J	Liu, YX; Yan, XD				Liu, Yanxin; Yan, Xiaodong			Comparison of regional droughts impacts and social responses in the historical China: A case study of the Han dynasty	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						The Han dynasty; Regional droughts; Social stability; Famine	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COLLAPSE; WARS	Numerous quantitative studies have confirmed that climate change has had an important impact on the traditional agriculture-oriented Chinese society. Most of the related existing studies used temperature, precipitation, droughts and floods as the main variables for analysis and overlooked the impact of only drought disasters on social instability; however, drought is most closely related to famine. Moreover, previous studies lacked information on the contribution of climate-driven droughts in different regions and time scales to the national social instability. To solve this problem, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of the regional drought and national famine indexes during the Han dynasty and explored the influence and contribution of the regional droughts to the national instability, further exploring the root cause of the demise. Conclusion: In the Han dynasty, drought was an important factor for inducing social instability in China, but the regional differences were obvious. Droughts in Henan Province contributed the most to the social instability in China. Although the regional droughts in Henan Province were mainly responsible for the social instability and the demise of the dynasty, the abrupt climate change caused by the droughts was not the fundamental cause of the demise of the Han dynasty. The relationship between climate and famine is influenced by several regional factors; thus, we should comprehensively study the ancient human-land system. When the relationship between people and the land in historical periods is studied, the data from different regions should first be divided and then analyzed independently, to fully consider the regional differences.

The role of simulated spring water stress in interactions between eastern larch and larch casebearer	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Climate change; Defoliator; Invasive; Lepidoptera; Monoterpenes; Plant defense	WESTERN SPRUCE BUDWORM; LARIX-LARICINA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RADIAL GROWTH; WHITE SPRUCE; BARK BEETLES; PLANT-INSECT; DOUGLAS-FIR; TRADE-OFFS	Water stress can influence the ability of plants to tolerate and resist herbivory and indirectly mediate inset fitness. Larch casebearer, Coleophora laricella Hubner (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae), is an invasive defoliator in North America where it infests eastern larch, Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch (Pinaceae). Anomalous outbreaks of larch casebearer have been detected each year since 2000 in Minnesota, USA. In Minnesota, eastern larch typically occurs in peatland bogs or fens with complex hydrology. Given the potential for global climate change to alter precipitation and the seasonal flooding dynamics of eastern larch stands, we investigated the role of simulated waterlogging and drought on eastern larch-larch casebearer interactions over twoyears. We quantified the growth, survival, and foliarmonoterpene concentrationsof juvenile eastern larches in response to varying watering regimens and challenge from larch casebearer. We also quantified how watering regimenand monoterpene concentrations affected the survival of fourth instar larch casebearersto adulthood. The growth and survival of eastern larch was negatively impacted by challenge from larch casebearer, waterlogging, and drought, though the strength of responses varied between years. The monoterpene concentrations ineastern larchfoliage did not change in response to water stress or challenge from larch casebearer but the within-year concentrations of several monoterpenes decreased with time. Noconsistent patterns emerged in the response of larch casebearer to watering regimen or monoterpenes. In summary, it appears thatwatering stress and defoliation do not interactto impact growth and survival of juvenile eastern larches, but rather act independently.

J	Heise, UK				Heise, Ursula K.			Climate Crisis and Narrative Forecasting	GERMANISCH-ROMANISCHE MONATSSCHRIFT			English	Article								Forecast narratives are a staple of current engagements with the crisis of climate change in science, politics, and culture. From the regularly issued reports of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to Hollywood thrillers about coming natural disasters, forecasts of future statistical trends, weather events, and disasters seek to predict, warn about, and in the end often prevent the crises that accompany global increases in average temperatures. Fictional portrayals of climate change often prominently include scientists and scientific findings in their plots, though they do not necessarily reflect scientific predictions completely or faithfully: climate scenarios in short stories, novels, and films tend to focus on ice over heat, flood over drought, depopulated landscapes over demographic growth, and scarce resources over excessive consumption. These scenarios draw on narrative templates of disaster and apocalypse that have been associated with dread as defined by analysts of risk perceptions in particular cultures. They serve to drive home the dangers predicted by climate science regardless of strict adherence to scientific facts, but also risk turning into textual or visual cliches that no longer evoke fear. In some recent climate fictions, the figure of the scientist who forecasts the climate future has been replaced with an ordinary character or even mental patient who predicts disaster on the basis of intuitions, visions, or dreams, a narrative strategy that seeks to re-establish the dread that has been lost from many more conventional forms of climate storytelling, but also to open up alternative registers of knowledge about climate change.

A taxonomy of natural hazards applicable to cultural heritage was developed based on the existing theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Sudden-onset hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, and slow-onset hazards, such as wetting-drying cycles and biological contamination, were incorporated into the hazard assessment procedure. Future alteration of conditions due to climate change, such as change in heat waves' duration, was also taken into account. The proposed hazard assessment framework was applied to the case of the Historic Centre of Rethymno, a city on the northern coast of the island of Crete in Greece, to identify, analyze, and prioritize the hazards that have the potential to cause damage to the center's historic structures. The assessment procedure includes climate model projections, GIS spatial modeling and mapping, and finally a hazard analysis matrix to enable the sharing of a better understanding of multiple hazards with the stakeholders. The results can facilitate decision making by providing the vulnerability and risk analysis with the nature and spatial distribution of the significant hazards within the study area and its setting.

However, quantitative assessment of the performance of urban drainage systems in response to climate change with the latest emission scenarios of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 in China is quite limited. This study aims to investigate potential changes of extreme rainfall and their influence on drainage infrastructure in a representative urban area in Wuhan city, China. The Storm Water Management Model is established to investigate the response of drainage infrastructure to future design rainfall. It is found that the probability distribution of extreme rainfall for two historical sub-periods (1961-1985 and 1986-2005) has changed, especially in the head and tail of the frequency curves. Furthermore, the design rainfall with return periods of 2, 3, 4 and 5 years increases more significantly than those of 10 and 20 years. Consequently, the incapability of the current drainage infrastructure in the study area is aggravated.

An incentivised lab experiment is conducted on a representative sample in the neighbouring region of Bilbao. A 2 x 2 factorial between-subject design is used to measure risk acceptability in response to visual and economic impact framings, and the effect of experience is measured using a 2-period repeated game within-subject design. Results from the experiment teach us that photos of climate impacts can be an effective medium for provoking visceral feelings about climate change. When used in conjunction with simple numerical risk information, photos can help the public to engage more deeply with climate issues and in turn encourage them to take precautionary measures to limit losses in the future. Experiencing economic losses leads to reductions in levels of acceptable risks, but decision-making is characterised by little emotional or logical reasoning, signalling a use of heuristics such as 'gut impulse', which may be prone to cognitive bias.

The frequency of short duration, high-intensity rainfall is expected to increase in the future due to climate change. Given the limited capacity of drainage systems in South Asian cities, urban flooding and waterlogging is expected to intensify. The problem gets worse when low-lying areas are filled up for infrastructure development due to unplanned urban growth, reducing permeable areas. Additionally, solid waste, when dumped in canals and open spaces, blocks urban drainage systems and worsens urban flooding and waterlogging. Using hydraulic models for two South Asian cities, Sylhet (in Bangladesh) and Bharatpur (in Nepal), we find that 22.3% of the land area in Sylhet and 12.7% in Bharatpur is under flooding risk, under the current scenario. The flood risk area can be reduced to 3.6% in Sylhet and 5.5% in Bharatpur with structural interventions in the drainage system. However, the area under flood risk could increase to 18.5% in Sylhet and 7.6% in Bharatpur in five years if the cities' solid waste is not managed properly, suggesting that the structural solution alone, without proper solid waste management, is almost ineffective in reducing the long-term flooding risk in these cities.

Recent and future changes of precipitation extremes in mainland Portugal	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; CHANGE SCENARIOS; EURO-CORDEX; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; INDEXES; PATTERNS	Recent and future changes in precipitation extremes over Portugal were studied. Trends in selected precipitation indices were calculated on a seasonal scale for the period of 1950-2003. Considering the same indices, this study also assessed possible changes under future climatic conditions (2046-2065). Furthermore, trends and projections for the future were evaluated using a single/unified index of extreme precipitation susceptibility (EPSI). The results revealed statistically significant drying trends in spring, mainly in northern and central Portugal, while weak wetting trends were detected in autumn. The EPSI trends also depicted a decrease of extreme precipitation in spring over central Portugal and a slight increase in autumn over northern Portugal and nearby Lisbon. On the other hand, climate change projections revealed a decrease in precipitation, mainly over northwestern Portugal, whereas the contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation is expected to increase, mostly in southern Portugal. The maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) is also projected to increase throughout Portugal. EPSI showed enhanced susceptibility for most Portuguese municipalities, which may be associated with increased vulnerability to flash floods. Climate change projections by municipality for both EPSI and CDD are an important decision support tool for civil protection and for risk management in Portugal.

J	Islam, F; Bhattacharya, B; Popescu, I				Islam, Feroz; Bhattacharya, Biswa; Popescu, Ioana			Flood risk assessment due to cyclone-induced dike breaching in coastal areas of Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHERN BAY; STORM-SURGE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; IMPACTS; HEALTH; MODEL	Bangladesh, one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, has a dynamic delta with 123 polders protected by earthen dikes. Cyclone-induced storm surges cause severe damage to these polders by overtopping and breaching the dikes. A total of 19 major tropical storms have hit the coast in the last 50 years, and the storm frequency is likely to increase due to climate change. The present paper presents an investigation of the inundation pattern in a protected area behind dikes due to floods caused by storm surges and identifies possible critical locations of dike breaches. Polder 48 in the coastal region, also known as Kuakata, was selected as the study area. A HEC-RAS 1-D-2-D hydrodynamic model was developed to simulate inundation of the polder under different scenarios. Scenarios were developed by considering tidal variations, the angle of the cyclone at landfall, possible dike breach locations and sea level rise due to climate change according to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A storm surge for a cyclone event with a 1-in-25-year return period was considered for all the scenarios. The primary objective of this research was to present a methodology for identifying the critical location of dike breaching, generating a flood risk map (FRM) and a probabilistic flood map (PFM) for the breaching of dikes during a cyclone. The critical location of the dike breach among the chosen possible locations was identified by comparing the inundation extent and damage due to flooding corresponding to the developed scenarios. A FRM corresponding to the breaching in the critical location was developed, which indicated that settlements adjacent to the canals in the polders were exposed to higher risk. A PFM was developed using the simulation results corresponding to the developed scenarios, which was used to recommend the need of appropriate land use zoning to minimize the vulnerability to flooding. The developed hydrodynamic model can be used to forecast inundation, to identify critical locations of the dike requiring maintenance and to study the effect of climate change on flood inundation in the study area. The frequency and intensity of the cyclones around the world are likely to increase due to climate change, which will require resource-intensive improvement of existing or new protection structures for the deltas. The identification and prioritization of the maintenance of critical locations of dike breaching can potentially prevent a disaster. The use of non-structural tools such as land use zoning with the help of flood risk maps and probabilistic flood maps has the potential to reduce risk and damage. The method presented in this research can potentially be utilized for deltas around the world to reduce vulnerability and flood risk due to dike breaching caused by cyclone-induced storm surge.

It is expected that climate and land use changes, as well as hydraulic engineering measures, will have profound impacts on future hydropower potential. In this study, the hydropower potential of the Bafing watershed was estimated for the near future (P1: 2035-2065) and the far future (P2: 2065-2095). For this purpose, the moderate scenario ssp 126 and the medium-high scenario ssp 370 were used to explore possible climate impacts. In three management scenarios, we tested the interaction of the existing Manantali Dam with two planned dams (Koukoutamba and Boureya) using an ecohydrological water management model. The results show that, under ssp 126, a 6% increase in annual river flow would result in a 3% increase in hydropower potential in the near future compared with the historical period of 1984-2014. In the far future, the annual river flow would decrease by 6%, resulting in an 8% decrease in hydropower potential. Under ssp 370, the hydropower potential would decrease by 0.7% and 14% in the near and far future, respectively. The investment in the planned dams has benefits, such as an increase in hydropower potential and improved flood protection. However, the dams will be negatively affected by climate change in the future (except in the near future (P1) under ssp 126), and their operation will result in hydropower potential losses of about 11% at the Manantali Dam. Therefore, to mitigate the effects of climate change and adjust the operation of the three dams, it is essential to develop new adaptation measures through an optimization program or an energy mix combining hydro, solar, and wind power.

However, studies of co-impacts based on future scenario predictions are still lacking. This study proposed a complete methodology for simulating future changes in water resources and distinguishing the independent and synergistic effects of climate change and land use change. The coupling prediction model of land use and the global climate models were used for scenario predictions; the hydrological model and statistical methods were used for simulations and analyses. The Ganjiang River, the largest tributary of Poyang Lake, is chosen as the study area. In the future, the main trend of change in land use would be the expansion of construction land in the northern part of the basin, and the future annual precipitation and temperature (p < 0.5) would increase. In this basin, runoff is more sensitive to climate change than to land use/cover change, and the synergistic effects are not substantial. Most climate scenarios showed a significant change in monthly peak runoff. The current peak is in June; this is projected to decrease with the simulated future peak in August, causing problems in basin flood control and Poyang Lake water level regulation. This study proposed a methodology integrating the global climate models with predicted land use scenarios and tested the feasibility at the watershed scale by the case study.

What impacts water services in rural Alaska? Identifying vulnerabilities at the intersection of technical, natural, human, and financial systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Alaska water infrastructure; Water access; Systems of systems; Arctic communities; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE; INTERCODER RELIABILITY; COMMUNITIES; ECONOMICS; RISK	Thousands of homes in rural Alaska do not have access to in-home water services and those that are served often experience disruptions. Such gaps in service lead to extreme water conservation and water quality issues, causing health disparities in Native communities that have been historically disenfranchised. Water sector challenges in rural Alaska stem from a variety of conditions that create a complicated operating context, such as the extreme climate, limited funding, small workforce, and remote settings of the communities. It is imperative to holistically understand the nature of water sector challenges in Alaska, bringing together proxy views to gain an under-standing of overall system operations. In turn, our research objectives are to 1) identify challenges within the financial, human, natural, and technical systems involved in the provision of water services in rural Alaska, and 2) use a systems thinking approach to identify interdependencies between systems. Specifically, we identify the cascading impacts caused by the arctic environment and by climate change, and the factors contributing to the increase of unserved communities and system failures. To do so, we performed a deductive-inductive qualitative content analysis on semi-structured interviews with 19 stakeholders that work with water infrastructure in Alaska. Findings show that climate change exacerbates the Arctic operating context, straining financial and technical systems (e.g., flooding impacts source water quality). Additionally, we found that service disruptions are often caused by a lack of operations and maintenance funding; communities are only able to pay for repairs using emergency funds that become available after system failures. Here, we outline policy, engineering, and management leverage points that can be used to improve water services in rural Alaska. For instance, we recommend auditing funding systems to ensure equitable allocations and further exploring the water-energy nexus in arctic communities.

Rainfall extremes under climate change in the Pasak River Basin, Thailand	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6); extreme rainfall indices; Pasak River Basin; Thailand; trend analysis	BIAS CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; TRENDS	Changes in extreme rainfall tend to be magnified into unpredictable fluctuations in runoff, leading to flooding and drought in the Pasak River Basin of Thailand. Moreover, it also affects the operation of the existing infrastructure. Therefore, it is important to monitor changes in the extreme rainfall events and integrate them into planning and operations with the additional challenges posed by climate change. In this study, rainfall data at the ten observed stations across the basin was used to assess the extreme rainfall indices over the baseline period 1985-2014. The five new CMIP6 global climate model datasets and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways of SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 were selected to project the future climate scenarios from 2023 to 2100. The extreme rainfall indices trends are analysed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope, while the IDW technique is adopted to visualise the spatial trends. The results show that most of the rainfall indices in low-altitude areas are higher than in high-altitude areas, except for the duration-based indices CWD and CDD. The observed extreme rainfall shows a larger variation than that predicted by climate models. The very high greenhouse gas emissions exhibited by the SSP5-8.5 scenario contribute to greater uncertainty in future extreme rainfall for plain areas than in high-altitude areas. The Pasak River Basin is expected to experience wet rather than dry climates in the future. The spatial trends from past and future periods highlight the significant increasing trends in the area where the Pasak Jolasid reservoir is located. The results of this study will benefit policymakers in a position to reduce future climate vulnerabilities and can be used for building local adaptation strategies in response to long-term climate change.

Extreme Floods in Small Mediterranean Catchments: Long-Term Response to Climate Variability and Change	WATER			English	Article						palaeofloods; floods; climate change; flood frequency; climate change adaptation; Mediterranean rivers; Spain	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PALEOFLOOD HYDROLOGY; DOCUMENTARY SOURCES; SINGLE GRAINS; NE SPAIN; RIVER; LUMINESCENCE; EVENTS; RECORD; QUARTZ	Climate change implies changes in the frequency and magnitude of flood events. The influence of climate variability on flooding was evaluated by an analysis of sedimentary (palaeofloods) and documentary archives. A 500-year palaeoflood record at Montilea River (657 km(2) in catchment area), eastern Spain, revealed up to 31 palaeofloods with a range of discharges of 20-950 m(3) s(-1), and with at least five floods exceeding 740-950 m(3) s(-1). This information contrasts with the available gauged flood registers (since year 1971) with an annual maximum daily discharge of 129 m(3) s(-1). Our palaeoflood dataset indicates flood cluster episodes at (1) 1570-1620, (2) 1775-1795, (3) 1850-1890, and (4) 1920-1969. Flood rich periods 1 and 3 corresponded to cooler than usual (about 0.3 degrees C and 0.2 degrees C) climate oscillations, whereas 2 and 4 were characterised by higher inter-annual climatic variability (floods and droughts). This high inter-annual rainfall variability increased over the last 150 years, leading to a reduction of annual maximum flow. Flood quantiles (>50 years) calculated from palaeoflood+gauged data showed 30%-40% higher peak discharges than those using only instrumental records, whereas when increasing the catchment area (1500 km(2)) the discharge estimation variance decreased to-15%. The results reflect the higher sensitivity of small catchments to changes on flood magnitude and frequency due to climate variability whereas a larger catchment buffers the response due to the limited extent of convective storms. Our findings show that extended flood records provide robust knowledge about hazardous flooding that can assist in the prioritization of low-regret actions for flood-risk adaptation to climate change.

Wetlands are important globally for their soil carbon storage. Given that wetland carbon processes are primarily driven by hydrology, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of inundation is needed. In this study, we evaluated the effect of water level (WL) and inundation duration (ID) on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes by analysing a 10-year (2008-2017) eddy covariance dataset from a seasonally inundated freshwater marl prairie in the Everglades National Park. Both gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates showed declines under inundation. While GPP rates decreased almost linearly as WL and ID increased, ER rates were less responsive to WL increase beyond 30 cm and extended inundation periods. The unequal responses between GPP and ER caused a weaker net ecosystem CO2 sink strength as inundation intensity increased. Eventually, the ecosystem tended to become a net CO2 source on a daily basis when either WL exceeded 46 cm or inundation lasted longer than 7 months. Particularly, with an extended period of high-WLs in 2016 (i.e., WL remained >40 cm for >9 months), the ecosystem became a CO2 source, as opposed to being a sink or neutral for CO2 in other years. Furthermore, the extreme inundation in 2016 was followed by a 4-month postinundation period with lower net ecosystem CO2 uptake compared to other years. Given that inundation plays a key role in controlling ecosystem CO2 balance, we suggest that a future with more intensive inundation caused by climate change or water management activities can weaken the CO2 sink strength of the Everglades freshwater marl prairies and similar wetlands globally, creating a positive feedback to climate change.

The interactions between coastlines and their inhabitants around the world are highly diverse, making them challenging to model due to the non-homogeneous, nonlinear, and complex nature of human decision-making. Agent-based modeling has proven valuable in various fields, enabling researchers to explore various social phenomena and emergent patterns under different institutional frameworks, including climate change scenarios and policy decisions, particularly at local scales. This approach is particularly useful in providing insights into possible outcomes and feedback resulting from the convergence of individual- and community-level adaptation decisions, and it has increasingly been used to model coastal systems. However, there are a limited number of studies that examine the effects of climate adaptation decisions on coastal tourism systems. This paper aims to address this gap by first providing an overview of the current state of agent-based modeling literature that explores coastal community adaptation responses to climate change. Subsequently, the paper argues for the application of these methods to simulate the effects of adaptation on coastal tourism dynamics. To better capture the interactions within subsystems and potential redistributed effects inherent in multi-scale and multi-stakeholder decision-making processes within these systems, we propose integrating agent-based modeling with a novel system of socio-environmental systems (SoSES) approach. This integration aims to assist city planners, policymakers, stakeholders, and attraction managers in effectively assessing adaptation options to safeguard their communities from the multifaceted impacts of climate change.

Understanding the tidal response of estuaries to these effects can guide future management and help assess ecological concerns. However, there is limited existing understanding on how estuarine tidal dynamics may respond to the compounding effects of SLR and altered riverine inflows in different estuaries. To partially address this knowledge gap, this study used data analysis and scrutinised idealised hydrodynamic models of different estuary shapes and boundary conditions to (i) identify broad effects of SLR on estuarine tidal dynamics under various river inflow conditions, (ii) determine how longitudinal cross-sections are impacted by these effects, and (iii) highlight some implications for environmental risk management. Results indicated that short- to moderate-length, high convergent estuaries experience the greatest and short- to moderate-length prismatic and low convergent estuaries experience the least variations in their overall tidal dynamics (i.e., tidal range, current velocity, and asymmetry). These variations were most evident in estuaries with large riverine inflows and macrotidal conditions. Compounding effects of SLR and altered riverine inflows induced spatially heterogenous changes to tidal range, current velocity, and asymmetry, with transects nearest to the estuary mouth/head and at a three-quarter estuary length (measured from estuary mouth) identified as the most and the least vulnerable zones, respectively. These findings provide an initial broad assessment of some effects of climate change in estuaries and may help to prioritise future investigations.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of climate change on hydrological conditions and runoff management for low-impact development (LID) systems in the Tehran municipality area. The tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation data (3B42) were first analyzed for the study area by using the eleven models recommended by the IPCC. The MIROC model was identified as the best climate model due to its best performance, in terms of R-2, RMSE, and MAE for providing future precipitation data. Then, the precipitation simulated by the MIROC model was downscaled by the LARS-WG model under two scenarios, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Furthermore, runoff was calculated by the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for different storms. The results showed an increase in the intensity of the 25-year storm in the time horizon of 2021-2040, while the average annual precipitation showed a decrease of 30%. In this study, two LID options (permeable pavement and bio-retention cell) were selected and optimized with two objectives: (1) minimizing the produced runoff and (2) minimizing the costs of LID construction and maintenance under climate change conditions. The results indicated that the running costs increased by 30% and 55% for the scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively.

Climate change-related health problems due to floods and waterborne diseases are increasing. With increasing insight into impacts of climate change and urbanization on water availability and quality and of required adaptations, a shift towards climate-resilient water safety planning was introduced into an Ethiopian strategy and guidance document to guarantee safe drinking water. Climate-resilient water safety planning was implemented in the urban water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, providing drinking water to 5 million and 500,000 people, respectively. Based on the risks identified with climate-resilient water safety planning, water quality monitoring can be optimized by prioritizing parameters and events which pose a higher risk for contaminating the drinking water. Water quality monitoring was improved at both drinking water utilities and at the Public Health Institute to provide relevant data used as input for climate-resilient water safety planning. By continuously linking water quality monitoring and climate-resilient water safety planning, utilization of information was optimized, and both approaches benefit from linking these activities.

Rainfall events and climate change in Mediterranean environments: an alarming shift from resource to risk in Eastern Spain	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Episode; Rainfall intensity; Climate change; Resource; Risk; Mediterranean	EXTREME RAINFALL; WATER-RESOURCES; FLASH FLOODS; INTENSITY; PATTERNS; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; CATCHMENT; CLUSTER; TIME	Consequences of climate change in Mediterranean environments are difficult to predict, partly because daily data do not fit with the timescale of Mediterranean processes, and higher resolutions are needed. This work presents an analysis of 698 rainfall episodes in a wide area of the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Jucar Water Authority basin), between 1989 and 2016. From the original data, collected every 5 min, episodes were selected and characterized by indicators of accumulated precipitation, maximum intensity, reduced average intensity, and persistence. They were then classified, according to their predominance as resource or risk, into three types: (1) limited resource free of risk; (2) high resource, not free of risk; and (3) high risk and low resource. The results were mapped and compared with real events. The temporal evolution of episodes showed a general trend to decrease the resource and increase the risk, which was more pronounced inland than on the coast. Another alarming trend is the monthly shift in different episode types, which can lead to dangerous coincidence of episodes very productive and very intense.

This paper expands this topic by reviewing and presenting case studies in the middle and lower Yellow River, Henan and Shandong provinces. We first review the paleoenvironmental data of both regions and then use the Sanyangzhuang site, Henan, and the Chengziya and Jiaojia sites, Shandong, as examples of human activities and sedimentary histories. Comparisons between the paleoenvironmental and archaeological data reveal that the changes in human occupation at these sites did not occur synchronously with climatic and paleoenvironmental changes. On the one hand, human activities were influenced by extreme climate-related events such as floods. However, humans also show great resilience by returning to the same sites or continuing cultivation at the same sites. Changes in temperature and precipitation did not result in settlement abandonments. On the other hand, human activities ceased to exist in periods of land and climate stabilities. With their increasing capacity to modify landscapes through time, human decisions and activities become equally important as climate change.

The paper focuses on several predictors including subjective flood risk perception, trust in government officials, sociodemographic characteristics, and experience with flood damage. Using binary logistic regression, the results show that the likelihood of having flood insurance coverage is associated with past flood damage and socioeconomic status. Older people (over age 65) are more likely to have flood insurance than younger residents. Race, gender, trust, and perceived flood risk are not statistically significant predictors of flood insurance. We connect our findings to the paradoxes and conflictual dynamics of flood insurance, a major risk mitigation measure. As we point out, in flood-prone cities like New Orleans, flood insurance operates as a double whammy: uninsured or underinsured homes face pervasive risk of both flooding and rising insurance premiums under the conditions of global climate change.

Global warming has led to rise of the surface temperature about 0.7 degrees C since the early 20th century. Huge economic loss is likely to be expected without change in the management system of livestock farming. Therefore, the emphasis should be given to understand the mechanism of adapted livestock for their sustained production and performance during stressful conditions (heat, cold, drought, flood etc.) under tropical climate. Currently, India is losing nearly two per cent of the total milk production in cattle and buffaloes due to global warming. It has been estimated that about 85% places in India experience moderate to high heat stress during April to June. Slight increase in core body temperature have profound effects on tissue metabolism, electrolyte balance, neuro-endocrine functions etc, which in turn reduce fertility, growth, lactation and ability to work. Therefore, suitable strategies should be adopted in animal shelter, nutrition, breeding, reproduction and health care. Research commitments and selection of resilient breeds to climate change are mandatory without compromising production performance.

Effective adaptation through changes in agricultural management is essential to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we prioritize major adaptation strategies practised by the communities of Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve in South India by employing an analytical hierarchy process. A total of 700 farmers practising mixed farming in the biosphere reserve area were chosen for the study. Adaptation strategies were categorized into four sectors, viz. crop, livestock, fisheries and other strategies. Within each sector, five commonly practised adaptation strategies were chosen for the study. Hence, a total of 20 adaptation strategies were considered. 'Crop diversification' was identified as the major adaptation strategy. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for agricultural extension advisory services to promote diversified farming systems as a resilient and eco-friendly approach to enhance climate risk management within the biosphere reserve area.

Not mentioned are the necessary changes to existing design standards and protocols which will have to change in order to properly encompass climate change and variability, with associated uncertainties. Adjustments in engineering design standards and changes in hazards are examined, based on trend detection in observational records and projections for the future. Issues of urban and transport (motorways and railways) drainage design are also examined. Furthermore, risk reduction strategies are discussed. Finally, a way of accounting for non-stationarity in determining design precipitation and design floods is tackled. Climate change adjustments in engineering design standards, such as design precipitation and design floods, are reviewed via examples from Europe.

Despite the importance of drought as a significant driver of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, current understanding of drought consequences for freshwater biodiversity is very limited. We describe key barriers that hinder integrative drought research and monitoring across riverscapes. The primary constraint limiting understanding of ecological drought is an existing monitoring framework focused on human water consumption and flood risk in mainstem rivers. This approach is misaligned with escalating needs for research and data collection that illuminate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (i.e., vulnerability) of biota to drought across entire riverscapes. We present a hierarchical framework for integrated ecological drought monitoring and research that addresses drought vulnerability across riverscapes and describe how this approach can directly inform natural-resource management.

'Managed retreat', the intentional relocation of settlements away from hazardous zones, is growing as a proposed strategy for adapting to climate change in the United States and around the globe. As designers begin to integrate retreat into their toolkit of adaptation strategies, and as they are asked to participate in projects that include managed retreat, it is important that they also understand and negotiate the social, political and environmental implications of this form of climate adaptation. Retreat projects are often fraught with equity issues: who should relocate? And who should decide? Puerto Rico, which has a long history of displacement due to purported environmental risk, and which is currently the site of new retreat proposals as a result of Hurricane Maria's destruction, provides a space for analysing retreat projects and policies, and the role of spatial designers in their design and implementation.

Climate change and drought events are expected to further increase the human impacts on the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, and these impacts are gaining the attention of the scientific community. Here we show how the Chiese River watershed (Lombardy Region, Italy) represents an interesting opportunity to analyse the effects of traditional irrigation practices on N contamination in the context of water scarcity. During summer, flood irrigation is mostly sustained by groundwater withdrawal. Additional water withdrawals from the river contribute to the dry out of the Chiese River. The use of wells for irrigation over permeable and fertilized soils and the percolation of nitrate (NO3- ) from the vadose zone to groundwater result in the accumulation of NO3 - in groundwater and limited N losses via denitrification due to dominant oxic conditions. These practices contrast other measures targeting the reduction of N excess over arable land. In the Chiese River watershed, the N surplus from Soil System Budget calculations decreased by 43% since the early 2000 s but NO3 - concentration in groundwater remained high and stable (up to 98.0 mg NO3 - L-1). The dried-out Chiese River gains groundwater and NO3 - concentration at the river mouth approaches 32.2 mg NO3 - L-1. Our results suggest how the mismanagement of the watershed (overabundant fertilization and flood irrigation using groundwater) increases the N concentration both in the river and groundwater, leading to the violation of both Nitrate and Water Framework directives. We anticipate our assay to be a starting point for the conversion of the northern Po Plain to more efficient irrigation and fertilization practices to contrast severe droughts driven by climate change like the one who struck the Po Plain in summer 2022.

As forests are increasingly affected by global change, including climate change, more frequent and severe natural disturbances, and shifts in land use, open questions remain regarding the long-term and sustainable provision of this crucial protective service. To improve our understanding of the various effects of global change on protective forests, we summarized the current knowledge based on a systematic review. Focusing on changes in mountain forests' protective effect against snow avalanches, landslides, rockfall, torrential floods and debris flow, we assessed 72 peer-reviewed, English publications. Overall, climate-induced changes are expected to increase forests' protective effect at higher elevations but reduce it at lower elevations mainly due to increased drought. Natural disturbances usually decrease the protective effect of forests, and their impact is often further exacerbated by salvage logging. Different forest management strategies are often studied using forest simulation models, and their impacts on protective forests strongly depend on the local context and interactions with climate change. While clearcuts consistently reduce the protective effect, other forest management interventions such as thinning can have either positive or negative effects. Most of the reviewed studies were case studies based on forest simulation or process-based hazard models (but rarely combining the two), while empirical evidence was scarce. Forests' protective effect is often assessed using (diverse) indicators of forest structure, but evaluations of resulting risks are less common. More consistent modeling approaches linking forest structure to hazard and risk, as well as consistent indicators across different case studies, are needed for a better understanding of changes in protective forests and the service they provide under global change.

Substantial uncertainty exists to evaluate impacts of climate change on river catchment due to uncertainty in general circulation model (GCM) projections. In this study, impact of climate change on water balance and hydrological regime of Manipur River basin was investigated using SWAT model. A comprehensive semi-distributed soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was used for future projection of changes in hydrological regime of Manipur River basin based on two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). A coupled model intercomparison project's (CMIP5) based GCM downscaled outputs and future LULC projected data were used in the analysis. The projected temperature is likely to be increased by 2.84 degrees C and increase of 836 mm in annual average precipitation is projected under RCP 8.5 by 2090s. Change in meteorological condition and LULC will lead to increase in runoff, evapotranspiration and water yield by 57.79 m(3)/s (38.32%), 318.7 mm (54.59%) and 629.72 mm (89.82%), respectively, by the end of 21st century. This study demonstrates the importance of water balance components and its spatial and temporal variation in the Manipur River basin. The key findings of this study reveals that the runoff, evapotranspiration and water yield will increase in the coming decades. Increase in water yield may lead to landslides in the hilly region and flooding in low lying areas in future.

J	Fidelis, T; Rodrigues, C				Fidelis, Teresa; Rodrigues, Carla			The integration of land use and climate change risks in the Programmes of Measures of River Basin Plans - assessing the influence of the Water Framework Directive in Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Water resources; Land use; Climate change risks; RBMP; Programmes of Measures; Portugal	RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; DECISION-SUPPORT; CATCHMENT-SCALE; IMPLEMENTATION; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; PARTICIPATION; MULTIPLE; AVAILABILITY	Land use or associated practices have impacts on water quality and quantity. Some of these impacts may be aggravated by water-related climate change risks such as floods and droughts. At the river basin level, measures to foster water-wise land uses such as the prevention of soil pollution, soil imperviousness or floods, among others, may strengthen the articulation between land use impacts and water protection. The Water Framework Directive (WFD), framed by the concept of integrated water resources management, challenges the articulation between water processes and uses, and, consequently, between water resources planning and land use planning. To foster this goal, it required the Member States to establish in the River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) the Programmes of Measures (PoMs). These are critical to disseminate the water-land use nexus message to stakeholders. This article develops a discourse analysis assessing the use of terms associated with land use and water-related climate change risks by the PoMs established in Portugal. The results bring to the fore evidence-based data revealing that integrative approaches, noticeable in the very narrative of measures and on the allocation of responsibilities for their implementation, have not been reinforced after the WFD entered into force. They also show that the PoMs, usually understood as mainly technical planning tools, are strongly permeable to politically embedded institutional contexts. Two major fields of for future research emerge out of this research. One is to further assess if this is localized phenomenon or if it is occurring in other EU countries, and another to understand if the narrative of measures is influencing the very implementation of the PoMs over the EU.

Conversely, if/when National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) premiums rise by 50% to equal expected damages, property values will decrease by 8.8% in the short-term, with about half of that recuperated in the long run (4.7%) as quality-adjusted housing stocks contract by 7.5% over decades. This analysis informs community planning and current NFIP revisions that strive to balance solvency and social consequences. Furthermore, our extension of Poterba's (1984) dynamic user-cost of housing model can be used in integrated assessment models of climate change adaptation.

In this study, a method synthesizing the Box-Cox transformation and area weighted averaging is established for characterizing the PLE risks in China's provinces, which are divided into three zones to cope with PLE risks. Further, targeted strategies from the perspective of the disaster-induced factors and disaster-affected objects are explored for the regions within the different zones. The results show that the regions with a high production risk are mainly distributed in Guangdong, Henan, and Shandong, with an index between 0.80 and 1.00; the regions with a high living risk are concentrated in Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, and Hainan, with an index exceeding 0.72; and the regions with a high ecological risk are concentrated in Guangxi, Ningxia, and Yunnan, with an index exceeding 0.50. The overall PLE risk is high along the southeastern coast, intermediate in central and western China, and low on the Tibetan Plateau. From the A to C zones, the number of risk types and intensity of risks requiring attention gradually decrease. For the category A zone, recommended measures include the construction of disaster risk monitoring and early warning systems for coastal cities and major grain-producing regions, the development of urban ecological protection zones, and the adjustment of economic and energy structures, etc. Production and living risks are central to the category B zone, while ecological and production risks are central to the category C zone. This study can provide theoretical support for China's scientific development of land planning and the realization of a beautiful China.

The concurrent occurrence of multiple flood drivers such as high river flows and extreme sea levels can aggravate such impacts and result in catastrophic damages. In this study, the individual and compound effects of riverine and coastal flooding are investigated at Stephenville Crossing located in the coastal-estuarine region of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. The impacts of climate change on flood extents and depths and the uncertainties associated with temporal patterns of storms, intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) projections, spatial resolution, and emission scenarios are assessed. A hydrologic model and a 2D hydraulic model are set up and calibrated to simulate the flood inundation for the historical (1976-2005) as well as the near future (2041-2070) and far future (2071-2100) periods under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Future storm events are generated based on projected IDF curves from convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate model simulations, using SCS, Huff, and alternating block design storm methods. The results are compared with simulations based on projected IDF curves derived from statistically downscaled Global Climate Models (GCMs). Both drivers of flooding are projected to intensify in the future, resulting in higher risks of flooding in the study area. Compound riverine and coastal flooding results in more severe inundation, affecting the communities on the coastline and the estuary area. Results show that the uncertainties associated with storm hyetographs are considerable, which indicate the importance of accurate representation of storm patterns. Further, simulations based on projected WRF-IDF curves show higher risks of flooding compared to the ones associated with GCM-IDFs.

Almost all Indonesian regions are exposed to floods, landslides, soil erosion, drought, and heavy rains. In response to these challenges, the Government of Indonesia has determined integrated watershed management (IWM) to be one of the key programs to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as stated in the updated Indonesian nationally determined contribution (NDC). This paper intends to review Indonesia's efforts in mitigating and adapting to climate change through an IWM approach, and its attempts to realize a decent life and environment for all communities. Improvement of the IWM can be conducted by strengthening the synergy between the responsible institutions for watershed management and the responsible institutions for handling mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts. In addition, it is important to prioritize coordination, participation, and collaboration not only at the national government level but also at the international level, since numerous problems may exist in the transboundary between countries, and finding solutions should involve planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Implementing the micro watershed model (MWM), supported by culture, local wisdom, and traditional knowledge in communities, can be used to improve the current IWM.

However, they are more and more submitted to both human pressures and natural forcing. Climate change creates additional risks and is expected to intensify the loss and degradation of coastal low lying-areas. The aim of this paper is to assess the risk of flooding due to sea-level rise and storm-surges for two Moroccan coasts: Tahaddart, a relatively underdeveloped coast and Saidia which has experienced intense urbanization over the last decade. Their risk assessment was compared to that carried out on the even more developed coast of Tetouan. The main findings of this study are: (i) the high level of risk that threatens these coasts is due to their low elevation and the value of the exposed assets; (ii) there is a positive relationship between the coastal risk and the build-up rate: the more a coastal area is artificialized, the more its risk index is high; and (iii) Coastal risk assessment is a useful tool that can help decision makers and coastal managers in the development of adaptation strategies and management plans to protect coastal ecosystems and make them resilient in the face of climate change.

Along with coastal flooding and the encroachment of saltwater farther inland comes an increased risk of human interaction with pathogenicVibriospecies, such asVibrio cholerae,V.vulnificusandV.parahaemolyticus. This minireview examines the current literature for updates on the climatic changes and practices that impact the location and duration of the presence ofVibriospp., as well as the infection routes, trends and virulence factors of these highly successful pathogens. Finally, an overview of current treatments and methods for the mitigation of both oral and cutaneous exposures are presented.

However, a quantitative model to reveal the mechanism of how potential grain yields are affected by macro-scale arable land evolution and climate change has not yet been developed. In this study, we constructed a Grey Prediction Model-Future Land Use Simulation (GM-FLUS), which combined land system evolution with climate change data, to simulate changes in China's land system over the next 40 years. We improved the Global Agro-Ecological Zone (GAEZ) model, estimated China's potential rice yields and their spatial distribution in the next 40 years under four scenarios (shared socioeconomic pathway SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) of the Sixth International Coupling Model Intercomparison Project, analysed the spatiotemporal variations in the potential rice yields and their drivers, and provided appropriate suggestions for increasing rice yields. The simulation results indicated an increase in China's potential rice yields during 2020-2060 under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios and a decrease under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Moreover, China's development strategy of "achieving carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060" was similar to the SSP1-2.6 scenario, under which rice yields were relatively stable. Furthermore, under China's arable land protection policy, China's paddy field area will change slightly during 2020-2060, and potential rice yields will be influenced by climate. Under the four climate change scenarios, air temperature increased and was negatively correlated with potential rice yields in main rice-producing regions. Additionally, potential rice yields were positively correlated with precipitation, which increased stably under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios and decreased under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. These results suggest that the development of heat-resistant rice varieties and the implementation of measures that will mitigate the impacts of future temperature increases on rice yields are important for the conservation of paddy fields. Additionally, improving irrigation and drainage facilities is necessary to irrigate drought-prone paddy fields and drain flooded water.

The southernmost province, Ca Mau, is threatened by sea level rise and land subsidence. Little is known of the expected combined impact of these processes, or of the perceptions of farmers towards these threats. This study first projected the combined effects using the most accurate extant elevation data. Next, to assess perceptions, we interviewed 53 farmers from six communes within the province. We found that 43% of the province could be at risk of submersion by 2030, and 75% by 2050. The interviews revealed that the farmers were largely unaware of the imminence of submersion and did not fully comprehend the nature and magnitude of the underlying processes. Constrained by the requirements of their developmental trajectory, they were focused on short term threats to their livelihood (weather, salinization, pollution). Consequently, far from adapting to the larger threats, they are engaged in practices, such as groundwater extraction for aquaculture, that are hastening the demise of the region. Their plight offers warnings to similar regions around the world. We hope that our findings can inform the development of future outreach programs.

Egypt is one of the countries most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change (CC), especially in the aquaculture sector. CC is one of the biggest challenges of our time and has negatively affected different water bodies. CC leads to the combination of changes in water availability, a decrease in water quality, the movement of salt water upstream due to rising sea levels, and the salinization of groundwater supplies will threaten inland freshwater aquaculture. Similarly, higher temperatures resulting from CC lead to reduce dissolved oxygen levels, increased fish metabolic rates, increased risk of disease spread, increased fish mortality, and consequently decreased fish production. CC may also indirectly affect aquaculture activities; for example, large areas of lowland aquaculture ponds can be highly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels. Thus, the current overview will briefly discuss the state of the aquaculture sector in Egypt, the meaning of CC, its causes, and its effects on the different elements of the aquaculture sector, and finally, we will review the appropriate ways to mitigate the adverse effects of CC on fish farming, especially in Egypt.

Human activity and related carbon emissions are the primary cause of land use and climate change, which has a substantial impact on extreme weather conditions, such as floods. This study presents high-resolution flood susceptibility maps of different future periods (up to 2100) using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS modelling. To quantify the future flood susceptibility various flood causative factors, Global circulation model (GCM) rainfall and land use and land cover (LULC) data are envisaged. The present flood susceptibility model has been evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, where area under curve (AUC) value shows the 91.57% accuracy of this flood susceptibility model and it can be used for future flood susceptibility modelling. Based on the projected LULC, rainfall and flood susceptibility, the results of the study indicating maximum monthly rainfall will increase by approximately 40-50 mm in 2100, while the conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural and built-up land is about 0.071 million sq. km. and the severe flood event area will increase by up to 122% (0.15 million sq. km) from now on.

We have used the Community-Based Adaptations (CBA) lens to explore how Brazilian Amazon communities have responded to extreme flooding in the last decade. Using a variety of data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews and validation workshops, we found a wide range of locally-devised coping, adaptive, and transformative responses, despite a lack of governmental support. A newly-proposed category of 'annual responses' was crafted to describe short-term measures taken that were repeated when necessary, but were not fixed, allowing for flexibility and agility. Through our findings, we propose an absorb-cope-adapt-transform (ACAT) spectrum that captures the range of responses and the interplay among response categories. This spectrum highlights transformative responses which have become more important due to the increased severity of the changes experienced by communities. We conclude that the expected increase in the variability and unpredictability of environmental and social conditions will require increased robustness and flexibility of rural communities exposed to climatic changes. This will demand conceptual tools analytically more powerful to detect such systems' attributes. We intend that our ACAT spectrum contributes to CBA research in this regard.

In 2018, the country enacted the Act of Climate Change Adaptation to formulate plans at national and local levels. The government has suggested the use of nature-based solutions (NBSs) across the country to address the increased risk of natural disasters. This study employs scenario analysis to examine the effectiveness of NBSs for the mitigation of flood risk and their implications on the provision of ecosystem services (ESs). Shiga prefecture in Japan enacted its own ordinance in 2015. This ordinance considers existing land use and building regulations to mitigate flood risk. The quantitative analysis assumes nine scenarios up to the year 2050, combining the current policy of Shiga and our original assumption of advance policy options to evaluate the future flood risk and ES. The analysis revealed that land use management can partially mitigate the flood risk by banning new residences and relocating residential land from flood-prone areas to safer areas and converting residential land into forest and paddy fields. It also suggests that both flood risk mitigation and provision of ESs can be further improved if local governments introduce a residence growth management strategy.

Being an agrarian country, floods poses higher threat to rural livelihood. The study assessed the underline causes of livelihood vulnerability in a flood prone rural area surrounded by riverine Jhok Reserve forest of Punjab Province. Using Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), eight potential components were inquired from two hundred natural-resource dependent households. Two approaches of LVI were customized to incorporate indigenous knowledge into 42 sub-components. The findings of the study showed that local people had poor socio-economic conditions, which led to have a wide networking gap in the community. People have become highly vulnerable to climatic changes because of higher environmental degradation in form of riverbank erosion, deforestation, etc. It was revealed that community in Jhok Reserve Forest had low adaptive capacities mainly due to higher poverty, low education level and lack of awareness about future disasters. And this has exposed them being unable to adapt to environmental changes. The findings of the study are significant for the policy makers to analyze the root causes of livelihood vulnerability and formulate agricultural adaptations for other rural communities. Overall, it is suggested that a reliable vulnerability assessment approach is presented in the study which can be replicated in other settings and regions of the world.

This study seeks to assess the causes of Duran's vulnerability by considering exposure, population sensitivity and adaptive capacity to establish alternatives to reduce its vulnerability to flooding. An operational framework is proposed based on the vulnerability definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and applying a census-based Index of Vulnerability, a geographic information system and local knowledge of urban development. A Principal Component and equal weighting analysis were applied as well as a spatial clustering to explore the spatial vulnerability across the city. A total of 34% of the city area is mapped as having high and very high vulnerability, mostly occupied by informal settlements (e.g., 288 hectares). Underlying factors were poor quality housing, lack of city services and low adaptive capacity of the community. However, some government housing programs (e.g., El Recreo), with better housing and adaptive capacity were also highly vulnerable. Limited urban planning governance has led to the overloading of storm water and drainage infrastructure which cause chronic flooding. Understanding the underlying causes of vulnerability is critical in order develop integrated strategies that increase city resilience to climate change.

Trends and environmental drivers of giant catfish catch in the lower Amazon River	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						artisanal fishery; climate change; Pimelodidae; sea surface temperature; time series analysis	GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROELECTRIC DAMS; MADEIRA RIVER; FLOOD REGIME; FISHERIES; DROUGHT; FISH; HYDROPOWER; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS	The giant catfishes Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii, Brachyplatystoma vaillantii and Brachyplatystoma filamentosum are important environmental, social and economic resources in the Amazon. However, anthropogenic environmental changes, such as climate change, deforestation, overexploitation of water resources and damming of rivers, threaten the conservation of this fishery. The aims of this study were to investigate temporal trends and elucidate global and regional environmental drivers of catch for these species of giant catfish in the Amazon. Using annualised catch data (1993-2010), we tested for linear trends using Mann-Kendall tests and built multilinear models of fish catch using effort and a variety of regional and global hydrological and meteorological series. We found a significant decline in the catches of B. rousseauxii and B. filamentosum, whereas the B. vaillantii catch increased. Total catch had a significant positive correlation with fishing effort, and variation in sea surface temperature (SST) explained an additional 19-38% of the variability of catches. Other hydrological and climate variables were weakly correlated or uncorrelated with catch. Overall, these results argue strongly for a resumption the collection of fishing statistics in the Amazon. In addition, associations between SST and catch suggest that conservation of these long-distance migrants must consider both regional and global drivers of fisheries change.	[Cruz, R. E.

Trends in Global Flood and Streamflow Timing Based on Local Water Year	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; SEASONALITY; POWERFUL; PATTERNS; RAINFALL; IMPACTS	Analysis of flood and streamflow timing has recently gained prominence as a tool for attribution of climatic changes to flooding. Such studies generally apply circular statistics to the day of maximum flow in a calendar year and use nonparametric linear trend tests to investigate changes in flooding on a local or regional scale. Here we investigate both the center timing of streamflow and the day of maximum flow using a local water year. For each station, the start of the water year is defined as the month of lowest average monthly streamflow. This definition of water year prevents ambiguity in the direction of computed trends and enables flood and streamflow timing to be described by a normal distribution. Using the assumption of normality, we calculate the historical trend in both flood and streamflow timing using linear regression. While shifts in flood and streamflow timing are consistent with climate change and are shifting in a similar direction, shifts in the timing of the annual maxima flood are approximately three times that of streamflow timing. The results here have implications for water resources and environmental management where streamflow and flood timing are critical to planning. The applicability of the normal approximation to flood and streamflow timing will enable future analyses to use parametric statistics.

A Framework for Planning and Evaluating the Role of Urban Stream Restoration for Improving Transportation Resilience to Extreme Rainfall Events	WATER			English	Article						stream restoration; flooding; climate change; extreme events; transportation resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK	Recent extreme rainfall events produced severe flooding across North Carolina's Coastal Plain, revealing deep vulnerabilities in many communities. Climate change is expected to exacerbate these problems by further increasing rainfall intensity and the frequency of extreme rainfall events. Due to the risks posed by these changing rainfall patterns, a shift in the approach to infrastructure planning and management is needed for many floodprone communities, particularly in regard to managing streams and floodplains in urban areas. This study proposes a framework for systematically evaluating stream restoration in combination with engineered improvements to culvert and bridge crossings to identify and optimize options for mitigating extreme events in urban areas. To illustrate the methodology, extensive hydraulic modeling was conducted to test four different strategies for reducing flooding along a channelized and armored stream, Big Ditch, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, USA. The results indicate that neither floodplain restoration nor infrastructure modification alone could alleviate flooding along Big Ditch. Rather, a combination approach would be required to mitigate flooding, which could result in substantial benefits for storms in excess of the 100-year event. The results suggest that shifting to a multi-faceted approach to improve resiliency to extreme events could improve public safety and reduce future damages due to flooding.

This necessitates mainstreaming of climate adaptation strategies in the global movement on climate action. Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) has become popular as an effective means of climate adaptation, which can be resilient and flexible compared to hard engineering-based measures. However, ecosystem-based approaches in disaster risk reduction still remain under-researched despite their growing popularity. This study delves into the utility of EBA in the context of the living lab, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) based Systematic Literature Review. A living lab (LL) is a participatory tool invented to foster innovation through real-life testing environments, such as individual cities. This study focuses on European coastal regions, as these are both highly populated and vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, storms, flooding and erosion. This study identified multiple synergies between the EBA concepts, living lab and disaster-risk reduction and concludes that EBA schemes can be highly effective in the living lab set-up. It also demonstrates that increased stakeholder engagement and the consideration of socio-economic co-benefits as part of the EBA-LL model can lead to successful disaster risk reduction.

Empirical evidence using the ZINB model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Economic development; Climate change; Disaster management	NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEATH TOLL; INCOME; GEOGRAPHY; EXTREMES; IMPACTS; GROWTH	Every year, extreme climatic events cause significant losses in South Asian countries, including India. The damages due to floods have gone up, affecting the overall development of the Indian economy. The current study uses zero-inflated negative binomial and negative binomial regres-sion approaches to evaluate whether economic growth lowers damage risk due to repeating flood occurrences for major flood-affected Indian states from 1981 to 2019. This study produces three significant findings. First, loss and damage indicators are on the rise across the country. Second, high-income states are more flood-resistant than poor states. Third, the real economic growth rate and the disaster risk follow a 'U' shape pattern. This study concludes that real per capita gross state domestic product and urbanization rate reduce the loss and damages due to disasters, while a rise in population density, more flooded areas, and heavy rainfall enhance the damage risk. Further, our study supports the economic growth theory of J. S. Mill that there is a negative association between disasters and economic growth. From a policy perspective, this study sug-gests increasing expenditures under the Disaster Risk Reduction program to lower damage risk. This study also urges the integration of the developmental planning and state action plan for climate change to encounter such climatic events thoroughly.

To combat the climate change, the watershed integrated management modelSoil and Water Assessment Tool model (SWAT)was used to simulate DFAA, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from 1961 to 2050, based on measured precipitation data in the Hetao area and the downscaled Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) climate scenarios. In the future, the increase in temperature and the increase in extreme precipitation will aggravate the pollution of water bodies. Results indicate that the risk of water quality exceeding the standard will increase when DFAA happens, and the risk of water quality exceeding the standard was the greatest in the case of drought-to-flood events. Results also indicate that, against the backdrop of increasing temperature and increasing precipitation in the future, the frequency of long-cycle and short-cycle drought-flood abrupt alternation index (LDFAI, SDFAI) in the Hetao area will continue to decrease, and the number of DFAA situations will decrease. However, the zone of high-frequency DFAA situations will move westward from the eastern Ulansuhai Nur Lake, continuing to pose a risk of water quality deterioration in that region. These results could provide a basis for flood control, drought resistance and pollution control in the Hetao and other areas.

Based on two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, projected changes in extreme summer rainfall events over West Africa were investigated using data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment models. Eight (8) extreme rainfall indices (CDD, CWD, r10mm, r20mm, PRCPTOT, R95pTOT, rx5day, and sdii) defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices were used in the study. The performance of the regional climate model (RCM) simulations was validated by comparing with GPCP and TRMM observation data sets. Results show that the RCMs reasonably reproduced the observed pattern of extreme rainfall over the region and further added significant value to the driven GCMs over some grids. Compared to the baseline period 1976-2005, future changes (2070-2099) in summer rainfall extremes under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios show statistically significant decreasing total rainfall (PRCPTOT), while consecutive dry days and extreme rainfall events (R95pTOT) are projected to increase significantly. There are obvious indications that simple rainfall intensity (sdii) will increase in the future. This does not amount to an increase in total rainfall but suggests a likelihood of greater intensity of rainfall events. Overall, our results project that West Africa may suffer more natural disasters such as droughts and floods in the future.	[Akinsanola, A.

Climate change is increasing the risk of a California megaflood	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; PACIFIC; MODEL; STORM; FREQUENCY; EVENTS; SYSTEM; FLOODS; SCALE	Despite the recent prevalence of severe drought, California faces a broadly underappreciated risk of severe floods. Here, we investigate the physical characteristics of "plausible worst case scenario" extreme storm sequences capable of giving rise to "megaflood" conditions using a combination of climate model data and high- resolution weather modeling. Using the data from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, we find that climate change has already doubled the likelihood of an event capable of producing catastrophic flooding, but larger future increases are likely due to continued warming. We further find that runoff in the future extreme storm scenario is 200 to 400% greater than historical values in the Sierra Nevada because of increased precipitation rates and decreased snow fraction. These findings have direct implications for flood and emergency management, as well as broader implications for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation activities.

The associated risks suggest a need for developing methodologies and models to assess damage costs in coastal areas as a basis for decision-making on climate change adaptation. The accuracy of damage cost estimates is critical in cost-effective decision-making on adaptation measures, reflecting climate hazards, flood levels, and associated damage costs. However, detailed models require extended work compared to simpler models due to demands on input data, including land use, damage costs, and adaptation options and costs. In the paper, varying levels of resolution, damage costs and flood models are assessed for coastal flooding risks for two Danish urban areas. Two damage cost models are used: a detailed, context-specific model using local high-resolution land use- and flood damage cost data and a less detailed model with lower-resolution land use data and damage costs based on generic European cost curves. Two flood models are used for the assessment using the detailed damage cost model based on a dynamic and a static flood approach, respectively. For the coarser model, only a static flood model is used. Significant differences are identified between the modelling approaches: The flood area varies up to a factor of ten for static floods due to the digital elevation map (DEM) model alone and a factor of 17 when changing both the DEM and using a dynamic flood. Corresponding factors for resulting damage costs are four and five, respectively.

The extreme indices considered were the consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1DAY), maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5DAY), precipitation > 2.5 mm (RR2.5), heavy precipitation > 10 mm (R10MM), very heavy precipitation > 20 mm (R20MM), and simple daily intensity (SDII) that have been calculated for 17 CMIP6 datasets from 1950 to 2014 with IMD-gridded precipitation datasets over India. Rankings were assigned using the TOPSIS method with evaluation metrics as CC and RMSE as conditions. Almost all datasets performed well for indices, i.e., CWD, R10MM, R20MM, and RR2.5. The top 5 performing models are EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3-Veg, MRI-ESM2-0, GFDL-ESM4, and MIROC6 which were ensembled and projected for future periods in the near (2015-2040), middle (2041-2070), and far future (2070-2100), and extreme indices were calculated under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 126 (SSP126), SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios. The ensemble mean shows that RX1DAY, RX5DAY, R10MM, R20MM, and CWD are observed to increase in western ghats and northeastern regions of India. Central India exhibits a dynamic influence on precipitation indices in different climate change scenarios.

Two distinct methodologies using spatial overlay, have been applied to identify exposure levels of schools in Subansari river basin, where flood events occur annually. In the study, flood conditioning parameters are applied to a large number of schools for the first time. The two methodologies employ seven parameters, namely distance from the stream, elevation, slope, TWI, clay content, groundwater table, and rainfall intensity. The distinction lies in the approaches to determine exposure level based on how the parameters are used in standard practice as per the literature review: parametrically and cumulatively. The findings of the two approaches are compared and recommendations are provided. The study indicates high value of parametric overlay analysis over the cumulative analysis since it identifies granular aspects of exposure and thus allows specific planning and design interventions in and around the schools. Hence,the study assists planners, architects, engineers and policy makers to develop relevant resilient, adaptive school design prototypes and policy in the region. The framework presented through the case study opens opportunity to enhance approaches adopted to reduce the flood risk among schools in the Himalayan region through adaptation, reducing vulnerability and improving capacity through GIS database creation for school going children.

A Mapping Review of Scientific Articles on Tropical Cyclone Mortality in English and Chinese	PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE			English	Review						cyclonic storms; disaster medicine; mortality	NEW-YORK-CITY; HURRICANE SANDY; RESILIENCE STRATEGIES; HEALTH; KATRINA; DEATHS; IMPACT; MARIA; FLOOD; RATES	Background: Tropical cyclones are a recurrent, lethal hazard. Climate change, demographic, and development trends contribute to increasing hazards and vulnerability. This mapping review of articles on tropical cyclone mortality assesses geographic publication patterns, research gaps, and priorities for investigation to inform evidence-based risk reduction. Methods: A mapping review of published scientific articles on tropical cyclone-related mortality indexed in PubMed and EMBASE (English) and SINOMED and CNKI (Chinese), focusing on research approach, location, and storm information, was conducted. Results were compared with data on historical tropical cyclone disasters. Findings: A total of 150 articles were included, 116 in English and 34 in Chinese. Nine cyclones accounted for 61% of specific event analyses. The United States (US) reported 0.76% of fatalities but was studied in 51% of articles, 96% in English and four percent in Chinese. Asian nations reported 90.4% of fatalities but were studied in 39% of articles, 50% in English and 50% in Chinese. Within the US, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania experienced 4.59% of US tropical cyclones but were studied in 24% of US articles. Of the 12 articles where data were collected beyond six months from impact, 11 focused on storms in the US. Climate change was mentioned in eight percent of article abstracts. Interpretation: Regions that have historically experienced high mortality from tropical cyclones have not been studied as extensively as some regions with lower mortality impacts. Long-term mortality and the implications of climate change have not been extensively studied nor discussed in most settings. Research in highly impacted settings should be prioritized.

Climate and land change impacts on future managed wetland habitat: a case study from California's Central Valley	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Integrated modeling; Wetlands; Land use; land cover; Climate change; Water availability; Waterbirds	WATER-RESOURCES; WINTERING WATERFOWL; PROTECTED AREAS; UNITED-STATES; RICE FIELDS; DROUGHT; SCENARIOS; COVER; SECURITY; DYNAMICS	Concept California's Central Valley provides critical habitat for migratory waterbirds, yet only 10% of naturally occurring wetlands remain. Competition for limited water supplies and climate change will impact the long-term viability of these intensively managed habitats. Objectives Forecast the distribution, abundance, and connectivity of surface water and managed wetland habitats, using 5 spatially explicit (270 m(2)) climate/land use/water prioritization scenarios. Mapping potential future dynamic flooded habitat used by waterbirds and other wetland-dependent wildlife to inform management decisions. Methods We integrated a climate-driven hydrologic water use model with a spatially explicit land change model, to examine stakeholder-driven scenarios of future land change, climate, and water use and their impacts on future habitat availability. Results Declining water availability is the dominant driver of habitat loss across scenarios. The hot/dry scenarios showed the greatest declines in January flooded area by 2101-an important month for overwintering waterbirds. In contrast, higher water supplies in wet climates drive perennial cropland conversion and loss of potential habitat. Potential flooded cropland declined (25 and 33%) under warmer/wetter climate conditions due to this conversion to perennial crops, exposing habitat vulnerability. Conclusion Climate-driven loss of water availability had a greater impact on flooded habitat availability than land-use change. When combined, climate change and the conversion of potentially flooded cropland to perennial cropland will threaten future waterbird habitat particularly in January, the peak of the migratory bird season, even when habitat restoration goals are met. Stakeholder-informed scenario analysis can identify target areas for potential habitat change, vulnerability, and conservation.

Resilience to extreme flooding shown by both hydric and mesic wetland plant species	ECOHYDROLOGY			English	Article						climate change; flowering; functional traits; hydrology; mesocosm	REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; WEATHER EVENTS; GRASSLAND; RESPONSES; SURVIVAL; PERSPECTIVE; HYDROLOGY; RICHNESS; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY	Global climate change models forecast an increasing frequency and duration of extreme flood events, including during the growing season. In this mesocosm experiment, the survival, growth, and flowering of two hydric and two mesic wetland plant species were monitored under two extreme flood regimes, namely, repeated 2- and 7-day floods, and compared with unflooded conditions. Plant survival was not significantly affected by flooding, but species showed different growth and flowering responses to the flood regimes. The hydric species Cardamine pratensis showed contrasting responses to floods with significantly more flowering stems and longer leaves in the 2-day regime but delayed and poorer flowering in the 7-day regime. Juncus articulatus, the other hydric species, responded most actively to 7-day flooding, with significantly longer leaves, taller and more abundant flowering stems, and more flowers than in unflooded conditions. The mesic species Ranunculus acris showed variable growth and phenological responses to flooding, whereas Scorzoneroides autumnalis was most affected by the 7-day flood regime, producing significantly shorter leaves and flowering stems and fewer flowers earlier in the season, compared with unflooded conditions. Overall, repeated 7-day floods had a greater impact on plant performance than 2-day flood events. All four species showed resilience to extreme flooding, irrespective of whether they were classed as hydric or mesic, but there was differential tolerance between species. This suggests that wetlands should be able to sustain vegetation under flooding extremes induced by climate change but community composition, biodiversity, and wetland services will all be affected.

Projections of declining fluvial sediment delivery to major deltas worldwide in response to climate change and anthropogenic stress	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						deltas; fluvial sediment; hydrogeomorphic modelling	GANGES-BRAHMAPUTRA-MEGHNA; SEA-LEVEL; RIVER; FLUX; SUBSIDENCE; DISCHARGE; MODEL; IMPACT; OCEAN; SUSTAINABILITY	Deltas are resource rich, low-lying areas where vulnerability to flooding is exacerbated by natural and anthropogenically induced subsidence and geocentric sea-level rise, threatening the large populations often found in these settings. Delta 'drowning' is potentially offset by deposition of sediment on the delta surface, making the delivery of fluvial sediment to the delta a key balancing control in offsetting relative sea-level rise, provided that sediment can be dispersed across the subaerial delta. Here we analyse projected changes in fluvial sediment flux over the 21st century to 47 of the world's major deltas under 12 environmental change scenarios. The 12 scenarios were constructed using four climate pathways (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5), three socioeconomic pathways (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 1, 2 and 3), and one reservoir construction timeline. A majority (33/47) of the investigated deltas are projected to experience reductions in sediment flux by the end of the century, when considering the average of the scenarios, with mean and maximum declines of 38% and 83%, respectively, between 1990-2019 and 2070-2099. These declines are driven by the effects of anthropogenic activities (changing land management practices and dam construction) overwhelming the effects of future climate change. The results frame the extent and magnitude of future sustainability of major global deltas. They highlight the consequences of direct (e.g. damming) and indirect (e.g. climate change) alteration of fluvial sediment flux dynamics and stress the need for further in-depth analysis for individual deltas to aid in developing appropriate management measures.

Overall, the spatial distribution of the extreme precipitation thresholds is consistent with that of total precipitation, with the highest distribution appearing in the northeast part of the study area and the lowest distribution appearing in the west. The extreme precipitation events with high-percentile thresholds have more spatial and temporal variability than those at the low-percentile thresholds. We consider two types of indices representing frequency of extremes and their contributions to total precipitation. The frequency indices show similar spatial and temporal trends relative to the total precipitation than the contribution ratio indices. Additionally, the possible impacts of global climate indices, urban expansion and topography on the change in precipitation extremes are also considered. The weakening Eastern Asian monsoon (EAM) since 1970s has significantly influenced the change in contribution from indices of extreme precipitation over Beijing. The changes in precipitation extremes are also influenced by rapid urban expansion and topography, especially in spatial changes, with the higher values appearing in the urban and plain areas. In the context of global climate change and rapid urbanization, greater challenges in urban flooding and safety are caused by the changes in precipitation extremes.

The effective management of urban water drainage systems is particularly relevant to control and regulate the runoff impacts. Nevertheless, the mitigation of climate change effects and the adaptation to its impacts call for the implementation of new sustainable strategies and solutions. In this context, a key role can be played by Low Impact Development (LID) technologies of Best Management Practices (BMPs). Such innovative design approaches can lead to more sustainable and effective strategies for urban runoff control. In this paper, a methodology to increase the urban resilience to flooding risk through LID-BMPs is proposed and discussed. A tool for the optimal selection and design of different LID-BMPs is presented. The tool couples GIS processing with hydraulic simulations, constituting a Decision Support System (DSS) based on the meta-heuristic optimization algorithm Harmony Search (HS). The methodology was tested on the case study site of Soccavo, a suburban area in the Municipality of Naples (Italy). Several LID measures, including bio-retention systems, porous pavements, green roofs, were considered. Then, the effectiveness of combining LIDs with grey solutions to carry out hybrid solutions was also assessed. Results showed the capability of the proposed approach in detecting technically and economically viable solutions.

Study focus: This study aims to ascertain the difference between spatial bias heterogeneity of streamflow in large river basins such as CPRB for a robust analysis. The upstream major dams and the outlet of the basin were examined with two-step bias correction and compared with a more practical bias correction only at the outlet of the basin. The former clarified that, due to the large effect of downstream bias, the upstream bias effect was considered negligible thus the two approaches resulted in similar future projections in the CPRB. Through this comparison, streamflow bias in the past and future climate experiments was corrected considering its spatial characteristics for robust assessments of quantitative impacts of climate change. New hydrological insights for the region: A + 4 K warmer climate will increase the frequency of the 2011 flood in CPRB and enhance 100-year flood peak discharge by 1.1-1.6 times than the past climate (1961-2010). The future flood in the basin, which starts predominantly in September in the present climate, is likely to begin in September and August equally with a prolonged duration of floods around 10-50 days. The study region is likely expected to experience elevated flood volume, earlier flood occurrence, and longer flood duration which indicates that forthcoming floods will be more rigorous.

Impact of future climate change on malaria in West Africa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							NINO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; EL-NINO; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; TRENDS; FLOODS; SAHEL; CYCLE; ENSO	Understanding the regional impact of future climate change is one of the major global challenges of this century. This study investigated possible effects of climate change on malaria in West Africa in the near future (2006-2035) and the far future (2036-2065) under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), compared to an observed evaluation period (1981-2010). Projected rainfall and temperature were obtained from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) simulations of the Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric regional climate model (RCA4). The malaria model used is the Liverpool malaria model (LMM), a dynamical malaria model driven by daily time series of rainfall and temperature obtained from the CORDEX data. Our results highlight the unimodal shape of the malaria prevalence distribution, and the seasonal malaria transmission contrast is closely linked to the latitudinal variation of the rainfall. Projections showed that the mean annual malaria prevalence would decrease in both climatological periods under both RCPs but with a larger magnitude of decreasing under the RCP8.5. We found that the mean malaria prevalence for the reference period is greater than the projected prevalence for 6 of the 8 downscaled GCMs. The study enhances understanding of how malaria is impacted under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. These results indicate that the southern area of West Africa is at most risk of epidemics, and the malaria control programs need extra effort and help to make the best use of available resources by stakeholders.

For decades the region has been ripe with political controversies stemming from conflicting interests over its natural resources which all depend on the protection of approximately 1800 km of earthen levees that surround over 60 islands, some of which are below sea level and two-thirds of which are privately owned. This study uses the Q methodology to explore the discourses of the broad range of stakeholders, including farmers, land- and water-based recreation enthusiasts, water exporters, utilities, environmentalists, and government agencies, about flood risk and flood management in the Delta. The results of this study reveal five distinct views regarding the risk of submersion of one or more islands due to either overtopping during high waters or structural levee failures. The findings of this study also elucidate nuanced narratives on the viability of anticipatory climate change adaptation in the Delta. Proximity, sense of vulnerability, values, trust, and views of climate change are the underlying factors in these perspectives. The perspectives identified suggest that resolving decades of distrust among stakeholder groups will remain difficult; however, taking a cultural approach to understanding perspectives may provide an opportunity to open up the conversations to adaptation approaches, and thus fulfill the legal mandate to protect the Delta as an evolving place.

The ability to quantify agricultural GHG and implement practices to mitigate its emissions is of great significance. Optimal GHG mitigation practices in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China, have not been well documented. In this study, historical (2000-2014) and projected (2015-2049) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy-upland crop rotations were simulated at a county scale using the denitrification-decomposition model. The results demonstrated (1) historical mean emissions of CH4, N2O, and global warming potential (GWP) were 158.6 kg-C ha(-1) year(-1), 0.75 kg-N ha(-1) year(-1), and 22.15 Tg CO2-eq year(-1) in the study area (1 Tg = 10(12) g); (2) CH4 emission rates significantly increased, while there was no significant change in N2O under projected RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, and RCP8.5 induced 10% more CH4 than RCP4.5; (3) marginal flooding coupled with reduced-tillage practice was the optimal strategy to mitigate GHG emissions due to its lowest GWP. This study would provide insight into the agricultural GHG emissions, as well as the impact on climate change. Also, a theoretical basis for policymaking would be provided by this study.

They also offer many benefits to humankind and are considered essential to the mitigation of the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, throughout the world they are suffering the most intense of anthropogenic pressures so are, of all ecosystems, among the most endangered. Here, we bring together and synthesise existing ecological understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high heterogeneity and diversity of temperate floodplain forests and of the pressures threatening their high biological value due to habitat homogenisation. Floodplain forests depend on the periodic disturbances under which they evolved, including fluvial dynamics, traditional management practices and the activities of herbivores. However, they have been heavily degraded by climate change, invasion of exotic species, river-flow regulation, landscape fragmentation, eutrophication and the cessation of traditional management. We can now observe two general trends in temperate floodplain forests: (1) Due to intensive landscape exploitation, they are now more open and thus prone to the spread of competitive species, including of invasive exotics and (2) Due to the cessation of traditional management, along with modified hydrological conditions, they are composed of species in the later successional stages (i.e., more shade-tolerant and mesic) while light-demanding species are quickly vanishing. Restoration practices have brought about contrasting results when restoration of floodplains to their natural states has been problematic. This is likely because of interplay between various natural and artificial processes not previously taken into proper consideration. We would like to draw attention to the fact that restoration projects or the preservation of existing floodplain forest ecosystems should combine the restoration of watercourses with the mitigation of other important threats acting at different scales of the landscape (spread of invasive species, eutrophication of watersheds and inappropriate forest management).

To consider the two main sources of uncertainty on the subject of changing climate, i.e., greenhouse gases emission (GHG) scenarios and outputs of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), a daily rainfall time series was generated for two future periods (2021- 2050 and 2070-2099) at three risk levels of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50. To this end, 22 AOGCMs outputs following two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used. The results showed that the uncertainty of CC scenarios was primarily owing to the uncertainty of GCMs outputs. Regarding the 2021-2050 period, under both emission scenarios, the increase in peak discharge (Q(peak)) and flood volume (FV) were estimated to reach 70, 50 and 30% at three risk levels of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50, respectively. As the current century draws to a close, the difference between the results of the two emission scenarios becomes apparent so that in the 2070-2099 period, the RCP8.5 scenario estimates Q(peak) and FV more than the RCP4.5 scenario does. Additionally, it was found that the uncertainty caused by AOGCMs was more than that by GHG emission scenarios.

J	Saberifar, R				Saberifar, Rostam			Climate Change and Water Crisis (Case Study, Mashhad in Northeastern Iran)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						climate change; water crisis; drinking water; Mann-Kendall method; Mashhad		This study evaluates the situation of climate change in the metropolis of Mashhad. The data required for this study were obtained from the available documents, especially the meteorological station of Mashhad, and the research method was descriptive and analytical. The findings of this study indicate that showed significant changes in the average of all three temperatures in Mashhad station. So we can assume the intensification of temperature rise is due to the formation of the heat island phenomenon in Mashhad. Heat penalties not only affect energy consumption and increase emissions but also have other abnormal consequences. The study of the relationship between temperature changes and rainfall in the city of Mashhad with economic, environmental, and other indicators shows that almost all the indicators have decreased sharply with decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature. Specifically, the amount of investment in the tourism sector has decreased by almost 30%. Meanwhile, about 50% of the income and employment of this city is provided by the tourism industry. In particular, a comparison of the two climatic elements of temperature and precipitation shows that the region has been ruled by drought since 1993, which is still ongoing. Given these changes, four key risks can be prioritized for this city: Severe evaporation in the area; Occurrence of severe floods; Increased energy demand in hot seasons; and Fundamental change in the efficiency of energy production and consumption equipment. Increased investment in protection infrastructure (especially in the case of floods, recently intensified due to flash floods); transportation (the extreme sub- urbanism of the people due to the increase of pollutants in the built-up areas); health and medical facilities and equipment and the provision of green space, etc., are among the other consequences attributed to the climate change that has occurred in this city.

An improved snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is constructed based on the analysis of change characteristics of climate, runoff, and snow and ice cover in the middle and upper reaches of the Taxkorgan River in Xinjiang Province, China. Because of the large evaporation in the study basin, the evaporation loss is added to the model. The SRM and the improved SRM are calibrated and verified by using data such as temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, and snow-covered area (SCA) ratio in the study basin from 2002 to 2012. The results show that, compared with the SRM, the average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) of annual runoff simulation increases from 0.80 to 0.86 in the calibration and increases from 0.74 to 0.83 in the validation through the improved model, and the average runoff error reduces from - 12.8 to 1.32% in the calibration and reduces from - 20.0 to - 11.51% in the validation. After adding the measured flow rate for real-time correction, the average NSE of annual runoff simulation increases from 0.91 to 0.93 and the average annual runoff error reduces from - 7.76 to - 3.91% in the calibration. The average NSE increases from 0.85 to 0.89 and the average runoff error reduces from - 12.35 to - 2.76% in the validation. It indicates that the SRM structure with increased evaporation loss is more in line with the actual situation. The short-term simulation effect of the model is greatly improved by adding the measured flow rate for real-time correction. At the same time, the improved SRM and the hypothetical climate change scenario are used to analyze the impact analysis of the snowmelt runoff simulation in the partial wet year. The results show that in the case of rising temperature, the ice and snow ablation period is prolonged, and the annual runoff also changes significantly in time distribution. It is of guiding significance for the influence of climate change on the runoff of recharged rivers with ice-snow meltwater in the other alpine regions.

What is not to love? Climate change, drought, flammable vegetation, and naturally prevailing weather conditions make a significant portion of the population vulnerable in many ways. Earthquakes and tsunamis might come to mind, but perhaps more of a threat is fire and/or flooding at, on or near the wildland-urban interface. The recent Thomas fire in December of 2017 and subsequent flooding, debris flow and mudslides in Montecito that followed in January of 2018 highlight what coastal vulnerability means under the new normal of extreme wildfire and flooding danger for this region. This paper discusses the unique hazards along with local weather conditions that contribute to vulnerability. We then detail spatial analytics to assess, model and predict risks. Insights are offered for the Santa Barbara region associated with extreme weather vulnerabilities.

Added Value of Large Ensemble Simulations for Assessing Extreme River Discharge in a 2 °C Warmer World	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						hydrological extremes; climate change; floods; large ensembles; GEV; droughts	MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; TRENDS; MODEL; UNCERTAINTIES; CIRCULATION	The assessment of return periods of extreme hydrological events often relies on statistical analysis using generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. Here we compare the traditional GEV approach with a novel large ensemble approach to determine the added value of a direct, empirical distribution-based estimate of extreme hydrological events. Using the global climate and hydrological models EC-Earth and PCR-GLOBWB, we simulate 2,000 years of global hydrology for a present-day and 2 degrees C warmer climate. We show that the GEV method has inherent limitations in estimating changes in hydrological extremes, especially for compound hydrological events. The large ensemble method does not suffer from these limitations and quantifies the impacts of climate change with greater precision. The explicit simulation of extreme events enables better hydrological process understanding. We conclude that future studies focusing on the impact of climatic changes on hydrological extremes should use large ensemble techniques to properly account for these rare hydrological events.

Two ensembles of climate simulations are considered, a large ensemble of 22 global climate model simulations and a smaller ensemble of three high-resolution regional climate model simulations. The other components are two post-processing techniques, three lumped hydrological models and six probability distributions. These four sources are assessed through a method of variance decomposition applied to six flood indicators over a reference period and two future periods: 1976-2005, 2041-2070 and 2070-2099. Systematic differences are observed between basins with contrasting flood-generating processes. Snow-dominated basins consistently show larger variance contributions from hydrological models, while rain-dominated basins show climate simulations as their dominant source. These results underline the need to consider the variability of each component's uncertainty contribution and its link to hydroclimatic conditions and dominant processes.

Many studies in this field of research identify path dependencies as a key barrier to adaptation efforts. However, their respective definitions of path dependency are often vague and impede a comprehensive integration of this concept into APAs. We fill this gap by systematically exploring the constituent characteristics and conditions of path dependency based on the original theoretical literature that emerged in the 1980s and early 2000s. We then propose an operationalization based on examples of flood risk management practice, and highlight ways in which APAs may contribute to revealing and anticipating technological and institutional path dependencies. This conceptual work serves as a comprehensive and systematic baseline for analyzing path dependency in empirical studies using APAs within and beyond the flood risk context.

Significant Floodplain Soil Organic Carbon Storage Along a Large High-Latitude River and its Tributaries	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						boreal floodplains; organic carbon; fluvial geomorphology; permafrost landscapes	PERMAFROST-CARBON; YUKON RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND; THAW; AGE; CALIBRATION; DIOXIDE; EROSION; CHANNEL	High-latitude permafrost regions store large stocks of soil organic carbon (OC), which are vulnerable to climate warming. Estimates of subsurface carbon stocks do not take into account floodplains as unique landscape units that mediate and influence the delivery of materials into river networks. We estimate floodplain soil OC stocks within the active layer (seasonally thawed layer) and to a maximum depth of 1 m from a large field data set in the Yukon Flats region of interior Alaska. We compare our estimated stocks to a previously published data set and find that the OC stock estimate using our field data could be as much as 68% higher than the published data set. Radiocarbon measurements indicate that sediment and associated OC can be stored for thousands of years before erosion and transport. Our results indicate the importance of floodplains as areas of underestimated carbon storage, particularly because climate change may modify geomorphic processes in permafrost regions.	[Lininger, K.

Changes in the hydrologic regime due to the climate change lead to exacerbation of extreme events such as flood. In this study, firstly, the impacts of climate change in the extreme precipitations of a part of Tehran in Iran were investigated during the period 2020-2049 using 10 Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Then, Using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), the urban stormwater system of the study area was modelled during the base period (1981-2010) along with the moderate, pessimistic and optimistic conditions of the AOGCM models during the future period (2020-2049). Finally, the network performance was evaluated based on reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability criteria, along with the sustainability index. The simulation results revealed that the sustainability of the urban stormwater system is 77.89% during the base period while its value will be 77.73% and 77.61% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, during the future period based on the moderate conditions of the AOGCM models. Furthermore, the network sustainability was 73.10% and 81.98%, respectively, according to the results of CanESM2 model for pessimistic and CESM1-WACCM model for optimistic conditions under RCP2.6 scenario. It was found that during the future period, under the influence of both studied scenarios, there will be no significant increase in the number of network flooding points compared to the baseline period. The approach presented in this study can be used to evaluate the performance of stormwater systems in other urban areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Escalante, EF; Sauto, JSS; Gil, RC				Fernandez Escalante, Enrique; Sebastian Sauto, Jon San; Calero Gil, Rodrigo			Sites and Indicators of MAR as a Successful Tool to Mitigate Climate Change Effects in Spain	WATER			English	Article						Managed Aquifer Recharge; MAR; climate change; water management; IWRM; adaptation measures; indicators; Spain	RESOURCES	In this article, the authors will support Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) as a tool to combat Climate Change (CC) adverse impacts on the basis of real sites, indicators, and specific cases located Spain. MAR has been used in Spain in combination with other measures of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) to mitigate and adapt to Climate Change (CC) challenges. The main effects of CC are that the rising of the average atmospheric temperature together with the decreasing average annual precipitation rate cause extreme weather and induce sea level rise. These pattern results in a series of negative impacts reflected in an increase of certain events or parameters, such as evaporation, evapotranspiration, water demand, fire risk, run-off, floods, droughts, and saltwater intrusion; and a decrease of others such as availability of water resources, the wetland area, and the hydro-electrical power production. Solutions include underground storage, lowering the temperature, increasing soil humidity, reclaimed water infiltration, punctual and directed infiltration, self-purification and naturalization, off-river storage, wetland restoration and/or establishment, flow water distribution by gravity, power saving, eventual recharge of extreme flows, multi-annual management and positive barrier wells against saline water intrusion. The main advantages and disadvantages for each MAR solution have been addressed. As success must be measured, some indicators have been designed or adopted and calculated to quantify the actual effect of these solutions and their evolution. They have been expressed in the form of volumes, lengths, areas, percentages, grades, euros, CO2 emissions, and years. Therefore, MAR in Spain demonstrably supports its usefulness in battling CC adverse impacts in a broad variety of environments and circumstances. This situation is comparable to other countries where MAR improvements have also been assessed.

Increase in global temperatures are usually accompanied by drought, flooding and changes in soil nutrients composition that dramatically reduced crop yields. Against the backdrop of climate change, human population increase and subsequent rise in food demand, finding new solutions for crop adaptation to environmental stresses is essential. The effects of single abiotic stress on crops have been widely studied, but in the field abiotic stresses tend to occur in combination rather than individually. Physiological, metabolic and molecular responses of crops to combined abiotic stresses seem to be significantly different to individual stresses. Although in recent years an increasing number of studies have addressed the effects of abiotic stress combinations, the information related to the root system response is still scarce. Roots are the underground organs that directly contact with the soil and sense many of these abiotic stresses. Understanding the effects of abiotic stress combinations in the root system would help to find new breeding tools to develop more resilient crops. This review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the effects of combined abiotic stress in the root system in crops. First, we will provide a general overview of root responses to particular abiotic stresses. Then, we will describe how these root responses are integrated when crops are challenged to the combination of different abiotic stress. We will focus on the main changes on root system architecture (RSA) and physiology influencing crop productivity and yield and convey the latest information on the key molecular, hormonal and genetic regulatory pathways underlying root responses to these combinatorial stresses. Finally, we will discuss possible directions for future research and the main challenges needed to be tackled to translate this knowledge into useful tools to enhance crop tolerance.

Strategies to cope and adapt to those changes may rely on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which can play an important role for understanding global environmental change at the local level. We aim to provide insights regarding perceptions of climate change, traditional ecological knowledge, and the coping strategies forest-dependent Indigenous people in the Amazon adopt when faced with climate change impacts. The outcomes are based on a mixed set of methods: comprising semi-structured interviews, meteorological data, and photovoice in a case study approach of 49 households of the Indigenous Territory TCO Tacana I in lowland Bolivia. Data were collected in 2013 and 2015; meanwhile, the study area was hit by a severe extreme weather precipitation event and resulting flood in 2014. The results demonstrate that Tacana's perception of weather trends and those of Western science-trained specialists complement each other because they provide different sets of details. The study revealed 38 traditional weather-related short-term indicators that underline the close interaction of Tacana with the environment. However, their current reliability has been questioned, indicating a need for further observation and research for potential long-term environmental change. Photovoice outcomes suggest that most of the negative effects during the extreme weather event were reported on natural capital in subsistence farming households. Indigenous households relied more on strong bonding and networking social capital (intracommunal and external), less on other capitals to cope with the flood event. Acknowledging TEK insights and changing local ecological indicators contributes information to assist sustainable ecosystem management and build corresponding resilient social systems. Local knowledge can support the understanding of climate and environmental change and local and regional risk management planning, interventions, and policy recommendations. This can considerably enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such strategies while counteracting the loss of traditional ecological knowledge.

But climate also modulates erosion and complex interaction loops, especially at large scale can hamper a clear understanding of these processes. Here we mainly use Uranium-series Comminution Age (tcom) of core sediments from Changjiang estuary to reconstruct the catchment erosion, and the relationship with climate changes and human activities during the last 14 kyrs. Since 14 ka, the sea level has been rising continuously until current highstand system tract in the East China Sea where the Changjiang estuary is located. The sediments in the Changjiang estuary mainly come from the upper reaches erosion zone during this period, but the sediment supply from the middle and lower reaches has gradually increased since the Late Holocene. The period can be divided into two modes. The first mode happens from the Bolling-Allerod period to the Mid-Holocene when the sea level rose rapidly, and the tcom of sediment recorded the residence time in the upper reaches erosion zone, with a periodic pattern of tcom in a good agreement with climate changes. During the cold and dry periods, the longer tcom (average 460 kyrs) is consistent with less precipitation resulting in shallower erosion with transported material mainly coming from the soil with longer residence time. In contrast, during the warm and wet periods, the tcom is shorter (average 290 kyrs), with the more abundant precipitations that contribute to deeper erosion in the upper catchment, and more fresh material transported to the estuary through stronger hydrodynamic forces. The second mode is more chaotic and corresponds to 0 to 4 ka, when climate was warm and humid and stable sea level, but tcom fluctuated from 200 kyrs to 650 kyrs. The increasing river flooding caused by abundant precipitation leads to lateral migration of the river channel in the middle and lower reaches, and the sediments deposited in the floodplain were eroded and mobilized again. In addition, the rapid development of human activities since 2 ka has accelerated deforestation and agricultural cultivation, leading to localized erosion of the floodplain. These remobilized sediments were transported to the estuary and deposited, resulting in a larger tcom value. This study overall indicates that, in the millennial scale, the tcom of fine detrital fraction shows a sensitive and quick response to catchment erosion, and provides new insights into quantifying the time scale of sediment source to sink processes and inferring the paleoenvironment accurately climate changes.

In this work, we analyzed the possibility of used and treated water being reused and the effect of its use on soil on the development of plants. In the case of irrigation with treated wastewater, the following parameters increased: calcium carbonate equivalent, organic matter, content of phosphorus, calcium, potassium, sodium, nitrogen, biochemical oxygen consumption; chemical oxygen demand (COD), decreased sodium absorption rate, soil electrical conductivity, pH, magnesium content, and soil bulk density. Due to the micronutrients it contains, the use of treated wastewater in irrigation can be an organic fertilizer for the soil. Wastewater is a source of soil water supply. Untreated wastewater may contain, depending on the source (industry, pharmacies, medicine, households), toxic compounds, bacteria, viruses, and helminths, which, if used for long periods of time in irrigation, can have a negative impact on health and the environment, reaching the soil, the roots of the crops, and then the underground water. Therefore, these waters must be used after adequate treatment. Global climate change disrupts the availability of fresh water and negatively influences the occurrence of floods, droughts, and water quality, which is why any water source must be managed correctly.

Cities need to adopt adaptive urban drainage measures capable of mitigating these drivers of change. This study presents a practical methodology for a modular design of bioretention systems incorporating land use and climate change into existing sizing methods. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis for these methods was performed. The methodology was applied to a case study in the city of Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil. Three application scales were evaluated: property scale (PS), street scale (SS) and neighborhood scale (NS) for three temporal scenarios: current, 2015-2050 and 2050-2100. The choice of the sizing method was the factor with greatest influence on the final bioretention performance, as it considerably affected the surface areas designed, followed by the hydraulic conductivity of the filtering media. When analyzing the sensitivity of the parameters for each method, the runoff coefficient and the daily precipitation with 90% probability were identified as the most sensitive parameters. For the period 2050-2100, there was an increase of up to 2x, 2.5x and 4x in inflow for PS, SS and NS, respectively. However and despite the great uncertainty of future drivers, bioretention performance would remain almost constant in future periods due to modular design.

Impacts of climate change on environmental flows in West Africa's Upper Niger Basin and the Inner Niger Delta	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; environmental flows; Inner Niger Delta	FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; HADEJIA-NGURU WETLANDS; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; RIVER FLOWS; FUTURE; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK	Modified water regimes due to climate change are likely to be a major cause of freshwater ecosystem alteration. General Circulation Model (GCM)-related uncertainty in environmental flows at 12 gauging stations in the Upper Niger Basin and flooding within the Inner Niger Delta is assessed using the Ecological Risk due to the Flow Alteration method and a hydrological model forced with projections from 12 GCM groups for RCP 4.5 in the 2050s and 2080s. Risk varies between GCM groups and stations. It increases into the future and is larger for changes in low flows compared to high flows. For the ensemble mean, a small minority of GCM groups projects no risk for high flows in the 2050s (low risk otherwise). This reverses for the 2080s. For low flows, no risk is limited to three stations in the 2050s and one station in the 2080s, the other experience either low or medium risk. There is greater consistency in the risk of change in flood extent, especially in the dry season (medium risk for all groups and the ensemble mean). Some (low or medium) risk of change in peak annual inundation is projected for most groups. Changing flood patterns have implications for wetland ecology and ecosystem services.

Depositional zones in the fan and changing main channel and distributary channels are influenced by the palaeo-relief inherited from a semi-arid climate and by the climatic changes. The upper sedimentary sequence of the fan, dominant on the Costa Verde, is of Upper PleistoceneHolocene age. The sediments forming it are non-cohesive and are highly mobile during floods and earthquakes. The dominant features in this sequence, intertwined channel facies and laminar flows, were influenced by the PleistoceneHolocene postglacial marine transgressions. A deeper understanding of the evolution of the Lima alluvial fan provides insight in to the fan's future evolution in the framework of active tectonics and climate change. The Lima fan is an area with high human population density and is subjected to floods and debris flows resulting in subsequent loss of human life and properties. Therefore, the improved understanding of the fan's evolution, resulting from this study, will contribute to a better definition of high risk areas of potential human disaster caused by these natural processes. Cyclic-fan-development, presently controlled by glacial sea level lows and palaeo-topography will continue regardless of human intervention in attempts to prevent natural disasters in Lima.

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify the determinants of health hazards among populations impacted by CCRHHs. Identified determinants were then grouped into categories of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity and aligned with available data. Data were aggregated to 4188 Census dissemination areas within two health authorities in British Columbia, Canada. A two-step principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to select and weight variables for each relative vulnerability score. In addition to an overall vulnerability score, exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity sub-scores were computed for each hazard. Scores were then categorised into quintiles and mapped. Results: Two hundred eighty-one epidemiological papers met the study criteria and were used to identify 36 determinant indicators that were operationalized across all hazards. For each hazard, 3 to 5 principal components explaining 72 to 94% of the total variance were retained. Sensitivity was weighted much higher for extreme heat, wildfire smoke and ground-level ozone, and adaptive capacity was highly weighted for flooding vulnerability. There was overall varied contribution of adaptive capacity (16-49%) across all hazards. Distinct spatial patterns were observed - for example, although patterns varied by hazard, vulnerability was generally higher in more deprived and more outlying neighbourhoods of the study region. Conclusions: The creation of hazard and category-specific vulnerability indices (exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity sub-scores) supports evidence-based approaches to prioritize public health responses to climate-related hazards and to reduce inequity by assessing relative differences in vulnerability along with absolute impacts. Future studies can build upon this methodology to further understand the spatial variation in vulnerability and to identify and prioritise actionable areas for adaptation.

As predictions of sea level rise have grown in magnitude and certainty, coastal real estate assets face an increasing climate risk. I use a complete data set of repeated home sales from Long Island in New York State to estimate the appreciation discount caused by the threat of sea level rise. The repeat sale methodology allows for time-invariant, unobserved property characteristics to be controlled for. Between 2000 and 2017, I find that residential properties that were exposed to future sea level rise experienced an annual price appreciation rate of roughly 1% point below unexposed properties. I provide numerous robustness checks to confirm this result. I also find evidence of demand spillovers by estimating an appreciation premium for properties that are near the coast but are relatively safe from sea level rise.

Estimates are negative for all three signals, and some are large: properties included in the new floodplain after escaping flooding by Sandy experienced 11% price reductions. We investigate possible mechanisms, including selection of properties into the market and residential sorting. Finding no evidence for these, we develop a parsimonious theoretical model that allows decomposition of our reduced-form estimates into the effects of insurance premium changes and belief updating. Results suggest the new maps induced belief changes comparable to those from insurance reform.

The current study utilizes historical cyclone tracks over the past five decades and, synthetic tracks are projected for the next 100 years to develop a comprehensive analysis of the storm surges in India. The impact of climate change on cyclone path and intensity is also considered. The ADCIRC model is used to compute storm surge heights and associated coastal inundation for historical and future cyclone tracks. An in-depth analysis is carried out using composite maps explaining the storm surge characteristics at various coastal locations. The novelty of this study lies in the comprehensive analysis of potential storm surges and associated coastal flooding related to exaggerated cyclones that are expected in a changing climate scenario. The outcome of the study is beneficial to storm surge operational centers and disaster management applications.

By applying large deviation theory to a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we define the climatology of persistent heatwaves and cold spells in key target geographical regions by estimating the rate functions for the surface temperature, and we assess the impact of increasing CO2 concentration on such persistent anomalies. Hence, we can better quantify the increasing hazard due to heatwaves in a warmer climate. We show that two 2010 high impact events-summer Russian heatwave and winter Dzud in Mongolia-are associated with atmospheric patterns that are exceptional compared to the typical ones but typical compared to the climatology of extremes. Their dynamics is encoded in the natural variability of the climate. Finally, we propose and test an approximate formula for the return times of large and persistent temperature fluctuations from easily accessible statistical properties.

Contributing to debates on disaster mobility and climate change induced displacement, the paper explores how citizenship and racialized differences unfolded during the flood event and how such differences had (de)mobilising effects for specific subgroups of Bangkok's irregular population. Drawing on the concepts of assemblage and affect the paper proposes to perceive of race as emergent within concrete interactions between bodies, rather than a pre-given social category or a purely discursive trope. From this perspective the body itself may become a repository to subvert or manipulate racialized perceptions. The paper argues that approaching race as an emerging assemblage helps to shed light both on the demobilising effects race had on people's mobility as well as on the fleeting moments of generosity and care between people that proliferated alongside such demobilisations.

A comparison of flood-protective decision-making between German households and businesses	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Protection motivation; Flooding; Company; Household; Protection action decision model; Natural hazards	MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; RISK REDUCTION; FEAR APPEALS; JUNE 2013; MITIGATION; INSURANCE; ADAPTATION; MOTIVATION; MANAGEMENT; LOSSES	Integrated flood risk management requires all stakeholders to limit flood impacts. Adaptation to flooding is a major avenue through which society designs our living spaces to cope with the threat of flooding. Within this context, there are many studies investigating the employment of property-level adaptation for households and the related decision-making process as both climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures. By comparison, businesses are a relatively neglected topic of study. This is a limitation, as businesses are important community members and suffer from a large share of flood losses, and their lack of preparedness undermines social resilience against climate change. Using survey data from the 2013 German flood, we compare the implementation of property-level adaptation measures by households and businesses. We further investigate whether similar factors drive adaptive behaviour using a structural statistical model of a hybrid of two socio-psychological models: the protection motivation theory (PMT) and the protective action decision model (PADM). Based on the empirical analysis of the combined framework, the main conclusion is that there is no great difference between the households and businesses in terms of their pre-disaster adaptation decision processes. However, companies did have a lower level of overall preparedness than households. This implies that results of decision-making from one stakeholder set may be applicable elsewhere, e.g., in developing agent-based models of disaster risk reduction or climate change adaptation. However, most of the businesses studied were SMEs and may not be representative of larger businesses, where decision-making processes are increasingly formalized. This is important, since small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are often not well prepared against flooding or other climate change impacts.

A large ensemble of 12 general circulation models (GCMs) from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that are dynamically downscaled by five regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional-climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Africa is used. In total, 43 RCM-GCM combinations are considered under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). The reliability of each of the climate datasets is first evaluated with satellite and reanalysis reference datasets. Subsequently, the Rank Resampling for Distributions and Dependences (R2D2) multivariate bias correction method is applied to the climate datasets. The bias-corrected climate projections are then used as input to the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) for hydrological projections over the 21st century (1991-2100). Results reveal contrasting dynamics in the seasonality of rainfall, depending on the selected greenhouse gas emission scenarios and the future projection periods. Although air temperature and potential evaporation increase under all RCPs, an increase in the magnitude of all hydrological variables (actual evaporation, total runoff, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage) is only projected under RCP8.5. High- and low-flow analysis suggests an increased flood risk under RCP8.5, particularly in the Black Volta, while hydrological droughts would be recurrent under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, particularly in the White Volta. The evolutions of streamflow indicate a future delay in the date of occurrence of low flows up to 11 d under RCP8.5, while high flows could occur 6 d earlier (RCP2.6) or 5 d later (RCP8.5), as compared to the historical period. Disparities are observed in the spatial patterns of hydroclimatic variables across climatic zones, with higher warming in the Sahelian zone. Therefore, climate change would have severe implications for future water availability with concerns for rain-fed agriculture, thereby weakening the water-energy-food security nexus and amplifying the vulnerability of the local population. The variability between climate models highlights uncertainties in the projections and indicates a need to better represent complex climate features in regional models. These findings could serve as a guideline for both the scientific community to improve climate change projections and for decision-makers to elaborate adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the consequences of climate change and strengthen regional socioeconomic development.

Coupling physical understanding and statistical modeling to estimate ice jam flood frequency in the northern Peace-Athabasca Delta under climate change	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Peace-Athabasca Delta; Climate change; Ice jam floods; Logistic regression; Flood frequency; Stochastic simulation	RISK	The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) of northeastern Alberta is one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world, laying at the confluence of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers. The PAD is internationally recognized as having a unique ecological and cultural significance, and periodic ice jam flooding from both rivers is an important feature of its current ecology. Past studies have debated whether a change in ice jam flood frequency on the Peace River has recently occurred, and what factors might be driving any perceived changes. This study contributes to this debate by addressing two questions: (1) what factors are most predictive of large Peace River ice jam floods, and (2) how might climate change impact large ice jam flood frequency? This work starts with a physically-based conceptual model of the necessary conditions for a large Peace River ice jam flood, and the factors that indicate whether those conditions are met. Logistic regression is applied to the historical flood record to determine which combination of hydroclimatic and riverine factors best predict large ice jam floods and the uncertainty in those relationships given the available data. Climatic factors including winter precipitation and temperature are most predictive of large Peace River ice jam floods. Other factors including winter river flows and freeze-up elevation provide little additional predictive power. The best logistic regression model is then forced with downscaled climate change scenarios from multiple climate models to project large ice jam flood frequency for a variety of plausible futures. Parametric uncertainty in the best logistic regression model is propagated into the projections using a parametric bootstrap to sample many plausible statistical models. Although there is variability across emissions scenarios and climate models, all projections indicate that the frequency of large Peace River ice jam floods is likely to decrease substantially in the coming decades, and that average waiting times between future large ice jam floods will likely surpass recent experience.

Taiwan, an island state, is deeply threatened by the multiple threats posed by climate change. However, different urban and rural areas have numerous adaptation approaches due to their differences in vulnerability. In Taipei City (urban), its biophysical vulnerability is mainly affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by landslides and heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by economic development, high household assets, and population concentration. In Yunlin County (rural), its biophysical vulnerability is also affected by flooded areas and high flood depths caused by heavy rains. Its social vulnerability is affected by the elderly living alone, low household assets, and low healthcare. In order to propose appropriate adaptation strategies of urban and rural areas under different vulnerabilities, this study uses an overlapping method to examine the relationship between the integrated vulnerability (biophysical and social) of Taipei and Yunlin along with the ecological footprint (EF), a measurement of human demands for resources and ecological services. This study reviews the literature and uses Taiwan's NCDR (National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction) data to analyze the biophysical vulnerability and the social vulnerability and further calculate the integrated vulnerability. In this study, questionnaire surveys were conducted. In Taipei, 446 valid questionnaires were collected, while 393 were collected in Yunlin. The results show that personal EF in Taipei is higher than that in Yunlin. In the end, this study elucidates the relationship between integrated vulnerability and personal EF of Taipei and Yunlin. Four types of risk areas in urban Taipei and rural Yunlin are sorted out (high vulnerability/high EF, high vulnerability/low EF, low vulnerability/high EF, and low vulnerability/low EF). The empirical results can be adopted by local governments, communities, and NGOs to establish appropriate strategies for mitigation and adaptation in the different risk areas.

These hazards are associated with negative impacts on infrastructure, communities and the environment. To identify the current intensity of climate change impacts in coastal urban megacities, an integrated evaluation method is needed. Firstly, the present study assesses the climate change impacts of Guangzhou, a Chinese coastal urban megacity, for both physical and social aspects. This study includes 60 years of time-series data for 1960-2020 to examine temperatures, precipitation, humidity and air pollution in Guangzhou city. At the same time, a survey was conducted between April and July 2022 in this megacity and collected the views of 336 people on climate change and its associated environmental impacts. Secondly, the Ganzhou city results are compared with existing data from similar nearby cities to evaluate the diverse climate change trends. Results show that during 1961-1990, the city received the most rainfall in May, reaching 283.6 mm. From 1990 to 2020, June recorded the highest rainfall of 356.6 mm and shows an increase of 73 mm during that period. The very severe monsoon season brought an increased risk of flooding. Results also revealed that the warmest month is July, and the coldest month is January, and both months showed increased temperatures of 0.60 celcius. Comparison results revealed that Guangzhou is not the only city which scored increased highest temperatures; other nearby cities including Heyuan, Shantou and Shaoguan also scored increased highest temperatures. The survey reveals that the majority of respondents (75%) perceived the increased frequency of extreme weather, including typhoons, heavy rainfall and multiple days of hot weather, such as higher temperatures and an increased number of hot days. In the responses to the questions related to the heat island effect, more than 80% of residents are aware of the existence of the heat island and its impacts. People believe that the primary causes of the urban heat island problem are industrial production and anthropogenic heat generated by the city. These results will be helpful to local and national policy and decision makers to revise and/or develop new strategies to improve the environment and quality of life in coastal megacities, particularly Ganzhou.

The study employed a two-step methodology (i.e. bibliometric and systematic review) to analyse the geospatiality of sea level rise impacts and communities' adaptation. In total, 363 papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and 292 were considered eligible and used for the bibliometric analysis. In the systematic review, the study aimed for specific community adaptation strategies from the 292 papers, and 118 papers were eligible following developed criteria. Results indicate that countries are committed to helping their coastal communities to adapt to sea level rise impacts and the USA has been significant in that regard. Coastal communities adapt to sea level rise impacts by increasing their structural/physical or social options; however, policy/institutional assistance to intensify these options is limited. Also, specific community adaptation strategies to sea level rise impacts have been more of the engineered and built environment (67%) strategies and few on ecosystem-based strategies (7%). More ecosystem-based strategies are, thus, needed considering their socio-ecological benefits. Further research and increased communities-policymakers engagement for enhanced adaptive capacity is required.

The Elephant Marsh, Malawi - Part 1: reconstruction of the historic hydromorphology	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Review						anthropogenic influence; climate change; ecological resilience; historic ecology; Lake Malawi; RAMSAR site; Shire River	ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; RIVER; BIODIVERSITY; REGIME; SYSTEM	The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and an area of permanent shallow lakes. The marsh is highly biodiverse, has a productive fishery and supports the livelihoods of a large human population. Chronicles and hand-drawn sketches by 19th-century explorers and subsequent travellers describing the marsh landscape were used to develop an account of the marsh's historic hydromorphology. These anecdotal accounts are supported by Shire River outflows from Lake Malawi, inferred from observed water levels in the lake from c. 1900. Records show that the marsh has experienced regular periods of drying out, followed by periods of greater inundation than it currently experiences. Long-term hydrological trends have been accompanied by anthropogenic influences such as catchment degradation and embankment construction, which have altered sedimentation patterns in the marsh. The marsh exhibits traits of resilience to natural long-term climate change through its ability to return to a similar state during wet periods, even following prolonged dry periods. Over relatively short time frames, however, the ecology of the marsh, as described when it was declared a RAMSAR site in 2017, likely has low resistance to hydrological regimes that are sensitive to climate change. An appreciation of long-term climate and recent human-induced changes afforded a unique opportunity for contextualising its hydromorphological trends within the Anthropocene.	[Birkhead, A.

The results revealed that (1) the annual, summer, and winter rainfall amount (RA) exhibited increasing rates of 16.36, 12.31, and 2.49 mm/10 year, respectively. The change rates of annual rainfall days (RD) were 2.68 day/10 year in the northwest region and -1.88 day/10 year in the southeast. The annual and seasonal daily precipitation on rainy days (RP) exhibited an increasing trend. (2) All of the RA, RD, and RP values initially increased, then decreased, and then slightly increased from Southeast to Northwest China. These results proved that the RA increased with the increase of light rain in Northwest China and heavy rain in Southeast China. In addition, changes in the monsoon have altered the rate at which RA, RD, and RP vary with distance from the sea. These findings may help to provide suggestions for the rational spatial utilization of water resources in China.

J	Gao, C; He, ZG; Pan, SL; Xuan, WD; Xu, YP				Gao, Chao; He, Zhiguo; Pan, Suli; Xuan, Weidong; Xu, Yue-Ping			Effects of climate change on peak runoff and flood levels in Qu River Basin, East China	JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrological model; 1D hydraulic model; LARS-WG; POT	WATER-RESOURCES; LARS-WG; MODEL; HYDROLOGY; RAINFALL; IMPACTS; SIMULATION; RISK; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE	The impact of climate change on regional hydrological extreme events has been a research topic that has received much attention in recent years. This paper aims to provide a general overview of changes on future runoffs and water levels in the Qu River Basin, upper reaches of Qiantang River, East China by combining future climate scenarios, hydrological model and 1D hydraulic model. The LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator) statistical downscaling method is used to downscale the GCM (Global Climate Model) outputs (including BCC, BNU, CanESM and CSIRO under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) and generate 50 years of synthetic precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures to drive the GR4J hydrological model and the 1D hydraulic model for the baseline period 1971-2000 and the future period 2021-2050. Finally, the POT (Peaks over Threshold) method is applied to analyze the change of extreme events in the study area. The results show that design runoffs and water levels all indicate an increasing trend in the future period for Changshangang River and Jiangshangang River at most cases, especially for small return periods, and for Qu River the increase becomes larger, which suggests that the risk of flooding will probably become greater and appropriate adaptation measures need to be taken.

This paper aims to construct a resilience assessment model for transport systems in the context of climate change based on an analysis of the spatial characteristics of regional transport networks and complex network theory, using the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China as the empirical object. Other objectives of the developed model are to establish a system of homogeneity, efficiency, and stability indicators and to assess the impact of flood depth (up to 7 m) on the resilience of transport networks in terms of static network structure and dynamic network performance by designing flood inundation disturbance scenarios. Finally, the characteristics, change trends, and conceptual connotations of the resilience of transport networks in coastal cities are condensed. The results of this study provide a solid scientific basis for future flood disaster risk management in global coastal cities.

Historical daily rainfall and temperature data from 1970 to 2018 were collected, along with projected daily data derived from general circulation models (GCMs) forecast spanning 2019-2060. The methodology involved analyzing historical and model forecast data, conducting trend analysis, mapping changes in land use, estimating runoff volume, selecting indicators, assigning their weights through the analytical hierarchy process, and generating vulnerability maps. Analysis of precipitation trends revealed a 14.61% decrease in total annual rainfall over the past 48 years; however, future projections indicate a 5.26% increase. Downstream sub-catchments in the arid portion are projected to receive higher rainfall, while upstream sub-catchments are expected to experience a substantial decline, resulting in an overall reduction in runoff. Moreover, our findings demonstrate a rising trend in mean temperature, which is expected to persist. Remote sensing data indicate a 14.76% expansion of urban areas, indicative of rapid population growth. Although no highly vulnerable sub-catchments were identified, downstream sub-catchments 8 and 9 exhibited moderate vulnerability to flash floods, which can be attributed to the increase in rainfall and insufficient stormwater infrastructure.

This paper attempts to apply the hydrological model based on the least action principle (HyMoLAP) at Chitral and Gilgit stations with few modifications. The topographic wetness index, the concept of degree-day factor and snowmelt (SM) using the snow cover area (SCA) have been incorporated into the improved HyMoLAP-SM structure. It is found that the HyMoLAP-SM model significantly enhanced the accuracy of the river flow estimation and forecast. Furthermore, the model seems highly sensitive to the choice of nonlinearity parameter and moderately sensitive to SM coefficients. Moreover, the response of river flow to climate change scenarios has been projected by utilizing modelled outcomes under temperature and precipitation variations. Overall, the results suggest that average river flow may get increased (reduced) by about 60% (40%) by the increase (decrease) in temperature. On the other hand, an increase (decrease) in precipitation at Chitral (Gilgit) may increase (decrease) the average flow by about 27% (200%) [19% (8%)] at the respective station. These results may be utilized for future flood/agricultural planning in Pakistan. Additionally, results obtained in this study may not be applicable to other geographical regions or interchangeable with other modelling purpose.

J	Tubridy, F; Lennon, M; Scott, M				Tubridy, Fiadh; Lennon, Mick; Scott, Mark			Managed retreat and coastal climate change adaptation: The environmental justice implications and value of a coproduction approach	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Managed retreat; Environmental justice; Coproduction	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; PLACE ATTACHMENT; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; KNOWLEDGE; FLOOD; BUYOUTS; LESSONS; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES	Due to the effects of climate change, coastal areas and communities around the world will be increasingly impacted by diverse hazards including sea-level rise, flooding and eroding shorelines, leading to increasing displacement of people. Managed retreat is one potential adaptation strategy to proactively plan for large-scale climate-related displacements. There is, however, evidence that in many cases managed retreat has had problematic social impacts and that it has frequently been implemented through top-down models of planning. In response, this article reviews the literature on managed retreat to identify the limitations of current practices and the challenges for a more environmentally just approach. Based on this review, the article argues that a coproduction approach would provide a means to help address key planning challenges in this field. This involves collecting local knowledge of the risks posed by climate hazards and/or retreat, creating a connection between local knowledge and institutional mechanisms for supported relocation and facilitating community-led processes of retreat and redevelopment. The key contribution of the article is its analysis of the value of a coproduction approach from the perspective of achieving a more environmentally just approach to managed retreat.

In the Boca and Ipoltica River basins, changes in forested areas were assessed from available historical and current digital map data. Significant forest losses occurred between 2004 and 2012. During the whole period of 1990-2018, forested areas in the Boca river decreased from 83% to 47% and in the Ipoltica River basin from 80% to 70%. Changes in runoff conditions were assessed based on an assessment of changes in the measured time series of the hydrometeorological data for the years 1981-2016. An empirical hydrological model was used to determine the design peak discharges before and after significant windstorms were estimated for different rain intensities and return periods. The regional climate scenario for the period 2070-2100 was used to assess the current impact of climate change and river basin deforestation on predicted changes in design floods in the coming decades. The effect of deforestation became evident in the extreme discharges, especially in future decades. In the Boca River basin, the estimated design floods increased by 59%, and in the Ipoltica River basin by 172% in the case of the 100-year return period.

Damage from natural disasters can lead to residential instability, which negatively impacts mental health and wellbeing. However, research on the mental health of residents who are displaced after natural disasters is relatively novel and needs more study. This study investigates experiences of mental health in residents in New Brunswick, Canada, who experienced residential damage and/or displacement during the 2018 spring flood. Lived experiences were studied through focus groups with 20 residents and perceptions of community mental health and wellbeing were captured during key informant interviews with 10 local community leaders. Data collection and analysis employed grounded theory. Findings indicate that those who had residential displacement or damage due to the flooding experienced negative mental health impacts, both during and following the flood. While natural disasters have devastating impacts on mental health, the data also indicate that the communities were positively impacted by a collective and collaborative response to the flood. This paper argues for the utility of communal coping as a concept to describe the experiences of communities following residential damage and/or displacement following natural disasters.

Mitigating risk for floodplain agriculture in Amazonia: a role for index-based flood insurance	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Floodplain agriculture; risk mitigation; floods; ambiguity aversion; index insurance	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; SUBSISTENCE FARMERS; DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEMAND; CREDIT; INTENSIFICATION; MICROINSURANCE	The fertile floodplain of the Amazon river offers considerable potential for agriculture, yet it is a risk-filled environment with heightened vulnerability due to climate change. The annual flood pulse deposits nutrient-rich sediment on the floodplain enabling increased agricultural productivity during the low water season. However, crops growing on the floodplain are at high risk of loss due to flood dynamics. Drawing on data from household surveys (n?=?83), focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, this study assesses potential flood risk mitigation tools for floodplain rice farmers along the Amazon river near Iquitos, Peru. Farmers? risk mitigation preferences are explored through willingness to pay (WTP) methods for flood-tolerant rice varieties, river information services, and index-based flood insurance. Results indicate that measured ambiguity aversion is a key driver in the decision to mitigate flood risk. The study suggests that the environmental risk context may be appropriate for an index-based flood insurance product, and farmers and local institutions see the promise of flood insurance. With climate change scenarios predicting greater variability in the flood regime, mitigating flood risk is paramount to reducing the vulnerabilities and unlocking opportunities for floodplain farmers in Amazonia.

We used a uniquely large and comprehensive range of 17 hydrological indicators (HIs), describing the temporal dynamics of drainage season, soil saturation, drained water balance and flood events. The HI values are calculated from simulated discharges provided by a subsurface drainage model, the SIDRA-RU model, fed by 12 climate projections from 1975 to 2100 (CMIP5 Euro-Cordex project), with three climate change scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We first verified that the HIs simulated using climate projections in the SIDRA-RU model over the historical period were not critically biased compared to the HIs obtained from the reference climatic reanalysis (SAFRAN). Second, we analysed and compared the HI evolution over different periods and under different scenarios. Our results showed that the number of significant changes in HI values increased under climate change by 2100, depending on the RCP: 2 HIs out of the 17 changed under RCP2.6; 6 HIs under RCP4.5; 10 HIs under RCP8.5. The intensity of drainage peak flows linked to flood events and the annual maximal discharge changed significantly under all RCPs. The temporality of the drainage season was substantially affected according to how pessimistic the RCP was. The worst changes were observed under RCP8.5, which exacerbated extreme events: The wet period was shorter while the dry period was longer by about 67%; the drought index increased by 100%; the summer drained water balance decreased by 9%. On the contrary, in winter, the duration of the wet period decreased while maintaining the same drained water balance, thus inducing stronger flood events leading to an earlier saturation of the drainage networks. The sustainability of the drainage system design at La Jailliere is therefore threatened, with the risk of fulfilling its function less effectively by 2100, exposing current crops to more important runoff and affecting water quality by increasing the leaching of agrochemical inputs.

In the densely populated Mekong Delta located at the mouth of the Mekong River basin in southern Vietnam, the hydrogeological systems have been transformed from an almost undisturbed to a human-impacted state and saltwater intrusion into surface water and groundwater systems has grown to be a detrimental issue recently, seriously threatening freshwater supply and degrading the eco-environment. In this article, the impacts of human activities and climate change (e.g., groundwater over-exploitation, relative sea-level rise, storm surge, changing precipitation and temperature regimes, uncontrolled drainage canals, operation of hydropower dams, and rapid development of aquaculture) on saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta are briefly reviewed. Based on current status of research findings regarding saltwater intrusion and the subsequent groundwater quality degradation under the impacts of human activities and climate change, major knowledge gaps and challenges are identified and discussed, including thickness and permeability of the silt and clay aquitard, present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater zones, dynamic variation of saltwater/freshwater transition zone, and the most effective and economical control measure. To bridge these gaps, future work should: 1) apply environmental isotope techniques in combination with borehole tests to gain detailed hydrogeological information regarding spatial variation of permeability and thickness of the silt and clay aquitard; 2) intensify regular groundwater monitoring and collect as much groundwater samples from multiple hydro-stratigraphic units at different depths as possible to visualize the present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater; 3) develop a series of variable-density coupled groundwater flow and salt transport models representing various scenarios of human activities and climate change for predicting future extent of saltwater intrusion; and 4) identify the dominant factor causing saltwater intrusion and determine the most effective and economical engineering technique to address saltwater intrusion problems in the Mekong Delta.

Rhipicephalus sanguineus complex has a worldwide distribution and transmits Rickettsial infections that could cause high mortality rates if untreated. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of R. sanguineus in the Americas in 2050 and 2070 using the general circulation model CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 (moderate emissions) and SSP2-8.5 (high emissions). A total of 355 occurrence points of R. sanguineus and eight uncorrelated bioclimatic variables were entered into a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to produce 50 replicates per scenario. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the consensus model (>0.90) and the partial ROC value (>1.28) indicated a high predictive capacity. The models showed that the geographic regions currently suitable for R. sanguineus will remain stable in the future, but also predicted increases in habitat suitability in the Western U.S., Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia. Scenario 4.5 showed an increase in habitat suitability for R. sanguineus in tropical and subtropical regions in both 2050 and 2070. Habitat suitability is predicted to remain constant in moist broadleaf forests and deserts but is predicted to decrease in flooded grasslands and savannas. Using the high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, habitat suitability in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands was predicted to be constant in 2050. In 2070, however, habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and increase in tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests. Our findings suggest that the current and potential future geographic distributions can be used in evidence-based strategies in the design of control plans aimed at reducing the risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases transmitted by R. sanguineus.

Anticipating sea-level rise and human migration: A review of empirical evidence and avenues for future research	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						adaptation; migration; sea-level rise; systematic literature review	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL MIGRATION; NATURAL DISASTERS; RURAL HOUSEHOLDS; DECISION-MAKING; ADAPTATION; FLOOD; DISPLACEMENT; MODELS; INTENTIONS	Sea-level rise (SLR) threatens millions of people living in coastal areas through permanent inundation and other SLR-related hazards. Migration is one way for people to adapt to these coastal changes, but presents an enormous policy challenge given the number of people affected. Knowledge about the relationship between SLR-related hazards and migration is therefore important to allow for anticipatory policymaking. In recent years, an increasing number of empirical studies have investigated, using survey or census data, how SLR-related hazards including flooding, salinization, and erosion together with non-environmental factors influence migration behavior. In this article, we provide a systematic literature review of this empirical work. Our review findings indicate that flooding is not necessarily associated with increased migration. Severe flood events even tend to decrease long-term migration in developing countries, although more research is needed to better understand the underpinnings of this finding. Salinization and erosion do generally lead to migration, but the number of studies is sparse. Several non-environmental factors including wealth and place attachment influence migration alongside SLR-related hazards. Based on the review, we propose a research agenda by outlining knowledge gaps and promising avenues for future research on this topic. Promising research avenues include using behavioral experiments to investigate migration behavior under future SLR scenarios, studying migration among other adaptation strategies, and complementing empirical research with dynamic migration modeling. We conclude that more empirical research on the SLR-migration nexus is needed to properly understand and anticipate the complex dynamics of migration under SLR, and to design adequate policy responses.

Results from a process-based crop model project future increases in wheat, grassland, and soybean yield due to climate change and atmospheric CO2 change; corn and sorghum show more muted responses. Results using yields from econometric models show less positive results. Both the econometric and process-based models tend to show more positive yields by the end of the century than several other similar studies. Using the process-based model to provide future yield estimates to an integrated agricultural sector model, the welfare gain is roughly $16B/year (2019 USD) for domestic producers and $6.2B/year for international trade, but domestic consumers lose $10.6B/year, resulting in a total welfare gain of $11.7B/year. When yield projections for major crops are drawn instead from econometric models, total welfare losses of more than $28B/year arise. Simulations using the process-based model as input to the agricultural sector model show large future production increases for soybean, wheat, and sorghum and large price reductions for corn and wheat. The most important factors are those about economic growth, flooding, international trade, and the type of yield model used. Somewhat less, but not insignificant factors include adaptation, livestock productivity, and damages from surface ozone, waterlogging, and pests and diseases.

The resulting dramatic increase in the turbidity of the water seriously affected the water supply. To effectively maintain the stability of the water supply and maintain the reservoir's storage capacity, the government of Taiwan began to plan and construct a series of improvement measures, such as a sediment flushing tunnel, the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir, and the Amuping Desilting Tunnel. However, previous studies only focused on the impact of the sediment flushing tunnel and the Amuping Desilting Tunnel on the downstream riverbed, and did not consider the possibility of increasing sediment discharge after the completion of the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir. In addition, climate change will cause the intensity of extreme rainfall to increase enormously in the future. That rainfall and extra sediment flushing will challenge the existing flood prevention facilities. Therefore, this study considered that the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir will increase sediment discharge of the Shihmen Reservoir, and used dynamical downscaling extreme typhoon data of climate change under the RCP 8.5 scenario to explore the flood prevention and riverbed migration of the main channels of the Dahan and Tamsui Rivers in the future. We used the rainfall-runoff model of Hydrologic Modeling System to simulate rainfall and runoff, and used the hydraulic and sediment transport model of CCHE1D to holistically simulate flood events and consequent river scouring and deposition behaviors. Our results showed that the projected peak discharge during the late 21st century (2075 to 2099) will be at least 50% higher than that during the baseline (1979 to 2003) period. In terms of flood prevention, the potential of overbank flooding will increase in the downstream area, and the trend of long-term change in the riverbed will be dominated by degradation (-0.489 +/- 0.743 m) in the future. The improvement measures will have a limited impact on riverbed migration (0.011 +/- 0.094 m) in the Dahan and Tamsui Rivers. After the operation of the JhongJhuang Bank-Side Reservoir, the Shihmen Reservoir is expected to increase the sediment discharge ratio by 70% during floods, and it will not cause excessive water turbidity that may affect downstream water supply.

Several studies have shown worsening of asthma symptoms with thunderstorms, wildfires, tropical cyclones, freshwater flooding, and temperature extremes. In particular, thunderstorm asthma can be exacerbated by certain factors such as temperature, precipitation, and allergen sensitization. Therefore, it is imperative that the allergy and immunology community be aware of the health effects associated with these extreme weather events in order to educate patients and engage in mitigation strategies.

The results show that tourism resilience research has not yet established a close collaborative network at the international level, although the themes of tourism resilience research have been diversified. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on tourism resilience can be divided into two stages. Climate change and the pandemic are the two major factors affecting tourism resilience at destination, organizational, and individual levels. Additionally, we identified five major themes of tourism resilience research. Finally, we provide three suggestions for rebuilding a new paradigm of tourism development in the post-pandemic era. It is hoped that the study contributes to promoting tourism resilience studies and provokes critical thought about whether tourism development need a "pandemic turn."

Here, we used Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection to evaluate the adaptive potential of Lasthenia fremontii, a herbaceous winter annual that is endemic to seasonally flooded wetlands in California, to alternative flooding regimes that occur during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The results indicate that populations may exhibit greater adaptive potential in response to dry years than wet years, and that the relative performance of populations will change across climate scenarios. More generally, our findings show that extreme climate events can substantially change the potential for populations to adapt to climate change by modulating the expression of standing genetic variation and mean fitness.

In addition to climate change, it is necessary to scientifically consider its regulation for the next hundred years. This study adopted a collaborative approach, involving industry, government, and academia, using Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to enhance ecosystem services. The solution layout is constructed by widening the channel and constructing additional farm ponds and wetlands. An hydraulic simulation indicated that flood control was addressed. The restoration project would create diverse aquatic habitats by simulating and evaluating the distribution of ecological biotopes, using porous materials as revetments. It provided urban residents with forest leisure and recreational sites and supported the local agricultural and forestry products. The restoration has propagated local culture and created environmental and professional education. Therefore, ecological services are enhanced regarding regulation, support, provision, and culture. This pilot study, led by researchers, aimed to promote comprehensive management concepts considering all stakeholders and their active participation. We integrated NbS into the watershed and its river system as a pathway for facing the challenges of rapid urbanization and climate change and improving ecosystem services.

Previous studies assessing adaptation measures are limited in quantifying the effects of climatic and social changes. As an interdisciplinary approach, this study developed an agent-based model of household locational choices and combined an advanced method for deriving on-site analytical flood risk curves (90 m resolution) to explicitly reflect the present/future flood risk on the flood insurance rate. To evaluate river channel improvements and amenity policies, the proposed framework was applied to a middle stream area of the Yodo River basin, Japan. The simulation results indicated that (1) both the design level and river pathway improvements influence the flood risk (2) developing wider areas over low- and no-risk areas rather than the intensive induction to limited no-risk areas lead to a more effective reduction in flood risk. In addition, (3) an appropriate amenity policy may contribute to the attenuation of the inequality of flood risk among regions owing to the pathway of improvement. The proposed interdisciplinary approach will help decision makers in long-term flood risk management.

Effects of experimental multi-season drought on abundance, richness, and beta diversity patterns in perennially flowing stream insect communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Aquatic insects; Climate change; Flooding; Beta diversity	SIERRA-NEVADA; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; SITE DISSIMILARITY; RIVER; REGIME; VARIABILITY; RESILIENCE; CALIFORNIA	Freshwater systems are projected to experience increased hydrologic extremes under climate change. To determine how small streams may be impacted by shifts in flow regimes, we experimentally simulated flow loss over the span of three summers in nine 50 m naturally fed stream channels. The aquatic insect community of these streams was sampled before, during, and after experimental drought treatments as well as following one unforeseen flood event. Abundance, richness, and beta diversity were measured as indicators of biotic effects of altered flow regimes. Abundance declined in proportion to flow loss. In contrast, we observed a threshold response in richness where richness did not decrease except in channels where losses of surface flow occurred and disconnected pools remained. The flood reset this pattern, but communities continued their prior trajectories shortly thereafter. Beta diversity partitions suggested no strong compositional shifts, and that the effect of drought was largely experienced uniformly across taxa until flow cessation. Pools served as a refuge, maintaining stable abundance gradients and higher richness longer than riffles. Upon flow resumption, abundance and richness returned to pre-treatment levels within one year. Our results suggest that many taxa present were resistant to drought conditions until loss in surface flow occurred.	[Saffarinia, P.; Anderson, K.

In this study, the statistical downscaling of the CanESM2 climate model was used with the help of SDSM4.2 software under three scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. By averaging the results of these three scenarios, a new scenario called the average scenario was developed to achieve a more realistic estimate, and the results were compared with the other three scenarios in the three time period from 2011 to 2099. Then, the second-order neuro-fuzzy model was used to simulate the inlet runoff to the Voshmgir and Golestan dams, and finally the cuckoo search algorithm was used to optimize the multipurpose operation of the reservoir systems with the aim of meeting downstream water needs and controlling probable floods. According to the results, an increase in average monthly temperature for minimum and maximum temperatures from 0.6 to 3.2 degrees C and variations in average monthly rainfall from values of at least - 18.4% to a maximum of - 43.1% can be probable in all scenarios during the three forecast periods.

Agriculture alone absorbed 26% of the overall impact caused by natural hazards in low- and middle-income countries and even in high-income countries yield losses due to extreme weather are relevant. Vulnerability curves are traditionally used to quickly estimate the damage due to extreme events. This study maps the articles published from January 2000 to May 2022 implementing crop vulnerability curves to weather-related extreme events and climate change. Fifty-two articles have been identified through the use of Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and the references of the selected papers. The selected papers have been analysed to determine for which extreme events vulnerability curves have been proposed, which crops have been studied, which explanatory variables have been used to create the curves, which functions are used to develop vulnerability curves and the number of parameters on which the proposed functions rely. Comparisons among the vulnerability curves for the various extremes are proposed, as well as indications of the main drawback of the developed vulnerability curves. Finally, areas where further research is needed are proposed together with recommendations on which elements should be included in vulnerability curve development.

Research into crop yield and resilience has underpinned global food security, evident in yields tripling in the past 5 decades. The challenges that global agriculture now faces are not just to feed 10+ billion people within a generation, but to do so under a harsher, more variable, and less predictable climate, and in many cases with less water, more expensive inputs, and declining soil quality. The challenges of climate change are not simply to breed for a "hotter drier climate," but to enable resilience to floods and droughts and frosts and heat waves, possibly even within a single growing season. How well we prepare for the coming decades of climate variability will depend on our ability to modify current practices, innovate with novel breeding methods, and communicate and work with farming communities to ensure viability and profitability. Here we define how future climates will impact farming systems and growing seasons, thereby identifying the traits and practices needed and including exemplars being implemented and developed. Critically, this review will also consider societal perspectives and public engagement about emerging technologies for climate resilience, with participatory approaches presented as the best approach.

This study provides a methodology to quantify the expected changes in future hydraulic risks at the catchment scale in the city of Pamplona. It considers climate change projections supplied by 12 climate models, 7 return periods, 2 emission scenarios (representative concentration pathway RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), and 3 time windows (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2070-2100). The Real-time Interactive Basin Simulator (RIBS) distributed hydrological model is used to simulate rainfall-runoff processes at the catchment scale. The results point to a decrease in design peak discharges for return periods smaller than 10 years and an increase for the 500- and 1000-year floods for both RCPs in the three time windows. The emission scenario RCP 8.5 usually provides the greatest increases in flood quantiles. The increase of design peak discharges is almost 10-30% higher in RCP 8.5 than in RCP 4.5. Change magnitudes for the most extreme events seem to be related to the greenhouse gas emission predictions in each RCP, as the greatest expected changes are found in 2040 for the RCP 4.5 and in 2100 for the RCP 8.5.

Climate change impacts on summer flood frequencies in two mountainous catchments in China and Switzerland	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						China; climate change; flood frequency; headwater catchments; stochastic modelling; Switzerland	MODEL	Flood events are difficult to characterize if available observation records are shorter than the recurrence intervals, and the non-stationarity of the climate adds additional uncertainty. In this study, we use a hydrological model coupled with a stochastic weather generator to simulate the summer flood regime in two mountainous catchments located in China and Switzerland. The models are set up with hourly data from only 10-20 years of observations but are successfully validated against 30-40-year long records of flood frequencies and magnitudes. To assess the climate change impacts on flood frequencies, we re-calibrate the weather generator with the climate statistics for 2021-2050 obtained from ensembles of bias-corrected regional climate models. Across all assessed return periods (10-100 years) and two emission scenarios, nearly all model chains indicate an intensification of flood extremes. According to the ensemble averages, the potential flood magnitudes increase by more than 30% in both catchments. The unambiguousness of the results is remarkable and can be explained by three factors rarely combined in previous studies: reduced statistical uncertainty due to a stochastic modelling approach, hourly time steps and the focus on headwater catchments where local topography and convective storms are causing runoff extremes within a confined area.

Ecological systems are often complex and span several issues that are not integrated in the social governance system. In order to increase the fit between social and ecological systems, understanding factors that promote the integration of interdependent issues is crucial. In this paper, we consider 11 issues related to flood risk management, e.g., technical flood protection and habitat loss, which are typically addressed in different policy sectors but exhibit ecological, functional, or geographical interdependencies. We analyze two bases for issue integration: a) political actors connecting issues and, b) the legal framework cross-referencing issues. We propose a network method for systematic comparisons between issue integration based on actors and integration based on laws. For the case of Swiss flood risk management, we find that actor- and law-based issue integration co-vary and might be self-reinforcing. We further find that issue integration mostly rests on laws, although cases exist where actors are the main basis of integration. Results promote our understanding of potential bases for the integration of policy issues, thereby contributing knowledge about adaptive governance capacities in social-ecological systems that buffer the effects of climate change.

Forecasting the flooding dynamics of flatwoods salamander breeding wetlands under future climate change scenarios	PEERJ			English	Article						Ambystoma bishopi; Amphibians; Conservation; Ephemeral wetlands; Hydrology; Management; Water level monitoring	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; EPHEMERAL WETLANDS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; WATER; MANAGEMENT; HYDROLOGY; SOUTHEASTERN; TRENDS; BIODIVERSITY; PHENOLOGY	Ephemeral wetlands are globally important systems that are regulated by regular cycles of wetting and drying, which are primarily controlled by responses to relatively short-term weather events (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration). Climate change is predicted to have significant effects on many ephemeral wetland systems and the organisms that depend on them through altered filling or drying dates that impact hydroperiod. To examine the potential effects of climate change on pine flatwoods wetlands in the southeastern United States, we created statistical models describing wetland hydrologic regime using an approximately 8-year history of water level monitoring and a variety of climate data inputs. We then assessed how hydrology may change in the future by projecting models forward (2025-2100) under six future climate scenarios (three climate models each with two emission scenarios). We used the model results to assess future breeding conditions for the imperiled Reticulated Flatwoods Salamander (Ambystoma bishopi), which breeds in many of the study wetlands. We found that models generally fit the data well and had good predictability across both training and testing data. Across all models and climate scenarios, there was substantial variation in the predicted suitability for flatwoods salamander reproduction. However, wetlands with longer hydroperiods tended to have fewer model iterations that predicted at least five consecutive years of reproductive failure (an important metric for population persistence). Understanding potential future risk to flatwoods salamander populations can be used to guide conservation and management actions for this imperiled species.

Study focus: Global climate change and intensified human activities are making the hydrological processes at Fuhe River Basin experiencing dramatic changes. Although some studies have investigated their individual impacts on basin-scale water resources, their combined effects on hydrology have received little attention. In this study, future scenarios were constructed for three future periods, based on five global climate model outputs (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and a dataset of future land use projections under three shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways (SSP-RCPs). Then, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to assess the relative changes in water balance components and extreme flow frequency under these developed scenarios. Furthermore, the hydrological response assessment methodology was improved from the original multiscenario ensemble flow forecast (MESF) framework, which not only strengthens the connection between climate and land use input changes but also adds more assessment items. New hydrological insights for the region: The flow at the outlet of Fuhe River Basin is expected to increase by approximately 27.1%-30.2%, 24.7-39.0% and 35.5%-43.5% in the 2030 s, 2060 s and 2090 s, respectively. Water availability will increase significantly in February, August and October and decrease in November and December. To the end of 21st century, surface runoff will have more than 100% increase. Future floods and droughts will be more frequent and severe under SSP5-8.5.

The nature of those alterations varies locally, creating the need for regional assessments to inform flood-risk management and planning. This study projects future changes in flood regime in the Yangtze River basin. To characterize flood regimes, we use a multi-attribute approach that mea-sures the relative change in flood magnitude, timing, frequency, and duration between historical and future periods. We use climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to force the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and generate daily streamflow projections along the Yangtze River network for two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. We use seasonal maxima, annual maxima, and peaks-over-threshold to determine the different flood attributes. Results show that down -scaled CMIP6 precipitation and near-surface temperature are both projected to increase substantially in the future, with a consequent surge in floods across the basin. In the far future (years 2061-2100), under SSP5-8.5, average annual flood magnitude, timing, frequency, and duration are projected to increase 66.6 %, arrive 1.9 days earlier, increase 27.5 %, and prolong 19.1 days, respectively. Projected changes in flood attributes at annual timescale are generally higher in the basin's northern tributaries than in the southern ones. Changes in flood magnitude and frequency tend to resemble each other, whereas flood timing and duration exhibit distinct change patterns. Our multi-attribute approach to flood regime characterization provides a systematic way for translating raw CMIP6 projections into informative future flood projections. This approach can help inform flood-risk planning and improve the reliability of climate change impact assessment.

Seasonal drought and its effects on frog population dynamics and amphibian disease in intermittent streams	ECOHYDROLOGY			English	Article						amphibian declines; California drought; chytrid fungus; climate change; freshwater conservation; invasive species; non-perennial streams; reconciliation ecology	BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; RANA-CATESBEIANA; CALIFORNIA RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DECLINES; PATHOGEN; EXPOSURE; COEXISTENCE; PERSISTENCE; PREDICTION	Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to amphibian declines globally, but drivers of outbreaks vary locally. Here, we explore the role of drought in population and host-disease dynamics of the endangered stream-breeding foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). In central California (USA) where severity of seasonal drought is increasing, we observed the non-native, Bd-tolerant and lentic-adapted North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) extend into streams when flood disturbance was minimal. Analysis of skin swabs revealed that prevalence and load of Bd infection among bullfrogs was low. Yet, among the native frogs, prevalence and load intensified as the seasonal drought progressed and surface flow became intermittent. When temperatures decreased in autumn and frogs concentrated at a reduced number of water points, we found dozens of dead foothill yellow-legged frogs (2018-2019). Necropsies suggested chytridiomycosis as the likely cause of death. Despite recent lethal outbreaks, foothill yellow-legged frog population abundance appeared resilient based on comparison to prior decades when no die-offs were observed. Wet-dry mapping of the stream channel and retrospective analysis of hydrologic records revealed that the native frogs spawn away from perennial pools, a behaviour that may allow them to avoid bullfrogs and predatory fish. In an ecological trade-off, tadpoles face the risk of the stream drying before metamorphosis. Fluctuations in population size thus corresponded to extremes of inter-annual variation in streamflow that limit recruitment rather than disease outbreaks. We conclude that hydrologic constraints, which climate change may exacerbate, appear to override the stressors of non-indigenous species and chytridiomycosis.

J	Ayar, PV; Mailhot, A				Vaittinada Ayar, Pradeebane; Mailhot, Alain			Evolution of Dry and Wet Spells Under Climate Change Over North-Eastern North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						climate change; large ensembles; wet and dry spells	SIMULATED PRECIPITATION; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; MODEL PERFORMANCE; EURO-CORDEX; TEMPERATURE; RESOLUTION; INDEXES; TRENDS; ENSEMBLE; DURATION	Risks associated to extreme hydrological conditions, such as floods and droughts, are expected to increase in future climate because of projected changes in precipitation and temperature. Assessing how wet and dry persisting conditions (or spells) will evolve in future climate is a crucial step in the study of extreme hydrological events. Projected changes over the north-eastern part of North America in the annual number of wet days, wet, and dry spells characteristics (number, duration), and wet spells intensities are analyzed. Two regional climate model ensembles are considered: the multimember ensemble from the Canadian RCM v5 (CRCM5-LE), and 16 simulations from the NA-CORDEX multimodel ensemble both using the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Comparison of observed and simulated wet and dry spells characteristics is first performed in present climate (1971-2000). Regional Climate Model (RCM)s tend to generate too many wet days and wet or dry spells resulting in shorter dry spells and slightly longer wet spells. Modeling uncertainties are accounted for a bigger contribution to the bias than internal variability since the multimodel ensemble dispersion is the largest. Throughout the 21st century, both ensembles project significant trends in winter at higher latitudes resulting in increasing wet day frequency, increasing number of wet spell, longer wet spells and shorter dry spells. For other seasons, internal variability of the CRCM5-LE and differences among the various NA-CORDEX simulations seems to overwhelm the climate change signal. Wet spell intensities increases are projected for all seasons over almost the entire domain. Globally, wetter climate with potential significant hydrological impacts are expected in many regions.
