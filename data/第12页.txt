TEMPERATURE AND REVERSE-FLOW PATTERNS OF THE RIVER STYX, MAMMOTH CAVE, KENTUCKY	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES			English	Article								River Styx and Echo River are two, closely-associated underground rivers located in the Mammoth Cave System. Both rivers are home to a variety of aquatic cave life, including the endangered Kentucky cave shrimp (Palaemonias ganteri). Typically, both underground rivers emerge at their respective springs and flow into the Green River. During flooding conditions, the Green River can back up into its subterranean tributaries, including the River Styx and Echo River. In addition, the hydraulic gradient in the River Styx can reverse under non-flood conditions of the Green River and create a stable, reverse-flow pattern. This phenomenon was identified at least as early as the 1920s, when a dye trace study noted that, after a rain event, Green River water was flowing into River Styx Spring and coming out at Echo River Spring. However, detailed studies on the River Styx's stable, reverse-flow patterns were not conducted until the 1950s, and little additional research has been conducted. Water temperature data were collected between October 2009 and October 2012 on the River Styx, Echo River, and Green River. During the study period, the Green River had a mean water temperature of 15.5 +/- 7.2 degrees C, while River Styx and Echo River had cooler and more stable mean water temperatures of 13.5 +/- 2.7 degrees C and 13.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature was used as a proxy for determining whether the River Styx was flowing forward (out of the cave) or backward (into the cave). Periods of time when the River Styx was flowing into the cave were classified as being due to back-flooding or a stable reverse-flow. During the times when data were available for all three rivers, the River Styx flowed out of the cave 77 % of the time, was in a stable reverse-flow 17 % of the time, and it was back-flooding 3 % of the time. These results differ from the original studies' results that identified the River Styx's stable, reverse-flow pattern. The different results could be due to anthropogenic influences on the Green River and/or due to differences in precipitation patterns, possibly as a result of climate change.

The study of seismicity in glaciers and ice sheets has provided valuable insights about the cryosphere for decades, more recently aided by tools from machine learning. Here, we present an unsupervised machine-learning approach to discovering and interpreting cryoseismic patterns using 5 weeks of seismic data recorded at Gornergletscher, Switzerland. Our algorithm utilizes non-negative matrix factorization and hidden Markov modeling to reduce spectrograms into characteristic, low-dimensional "fingerprints," which we reduce further using principal component analysis, then cluster using k-means clustering. We investigate the timing, locations, and statistical properties of the clusters in relation to temperature, GPS and lake-level measurements, and find that signals associated with lake flooding tend to occupy one cluster, whereas signals associated with afternoon and evening melt-water flow reside in others. We suggest that the one cluster contains signals that include the true initiation of the flood's englacial and subglacial drainage components. This work demonstrates an unsupervised machine-learning approach to exploring both continuous and event-based glacial seismic data. Plain Language Summary Earth's climate change poses extreme risks for the stability of glaciers and ice sheets. One such glacier, Gornergletscher in the Swiss Alps, has been monitored for decades, along with a lake on the glacier which from the 1950s until recently filled and drainedevery summer, releasing huge amounts of water under, through, and on top of the glacier. To study this glacier, which is hundreds of meters thick, and its lake, scientists employ "cryoseismology," the study of seismic excitations in the ice. In our study, we use unsupervised machine-learning, a type of artificial intelligence that identifies patterns in large data sets, to organize 5 weeks of cryoseismic records into clusters composed of similar types of signals. Although the machine-learning algorithm has no knowledge of glacial hydrology nor its evolution over time, the output places the signals associated with the beginning of lake flooding in one cluster, and signals associated with afternoon and evening melt-water flow in others. We also find that "icequakes" are clustered based on extremely subtle, similar, vibrations. From these findings, we provide an improved chronology for the glacial lake flood, and a better understanding of the cryoseismic signals caused by water flowing underneath and through glaciers.

J	Hassenruck-Gudipati, HJ; Ellis, T; Goudge, TA; Mohrig, D				Hassenruck-Gudipati, Hima J.; Ellis, Thaddeus; Goudge, Timothy A.; Mohrig, David			A multi-proxy assessment of terrace formation in the lower Trinity River valley, Texas	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; ATLANTIC COASTAL-PLAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLUVIAL TERRACES; ALLUVIAL RIVER; SEDIMENT; TRANSPORT; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION	A proposed null hypothesis for fluvial terrace formation is that internally generated or autogenic processes, such as lateral migration and river-bend cutoff, produce variabilities in channel incision that lead to the abandonment of floodplain segments as terraces. Alternatively, fluvial terraces have the potential to record past environmental changes from external forcings that include temporal changes in sea level and hydroclimate. Terraces in the Trinity River valley have been previously characterized as Deweyville groups and interpreted to record episodic cut and fill during late Pleistocene sea level variations. Our study uses high-resolution topography of a bare-earth digital elevation model derived from airborne lidar surveys along similar to 88 linear kilometers of the modern river valley. We measure both differences in terrace elevations and widths of paleo-channels preserved on these terraces in order to have two independent constraints on terrace formation mechanisms. For 52 distinct terraces, we quantify whether terrace elevations fit distinct planes - expected for allogenic terrace formation tied to punctuated sea level and/or hydroclimate change - by comparing variability in a grouped set of Deweyville terrace elevations against variability associated with randomly selected terrace sets. Results show Deweyville groups record an initial valley floor abandoning driven by allogenic forcing, which transitions into autogenic forcing for the formation of younger terraces. For these different terrace sets, the slope amongst different terraces stays constant. For 79 paleo-channel segments preserved on these terraces, we connected observed changes in paleo-channel widths to estimates for river paleo-hydrology over time. Our measurements suggest the discharge of the Trinity River increased systematically by a factor of similar to 2 during the late Pleistocene. Despite this evidence of increased discharge, the similar down-valley slopes between terrace sets indicate that there were likely no increases in sediment-to-water discharge ratios that could be linked to allogenic terrace formation. This is consistent with our elevation clustering analysis that suggests younger terraces are indistinguishable in their elevation variance from autogenic terrace formation mechanisms, even if the changing paleo-channel dimensions might, viewed in isolation, provide a mechanism for allogenic terrace formation. Methods introduced here combine river-reach-scale observations of terrace sets and paleo-hydrology with local observations of terraces and paleo-channels to show how interpretations of allogenic versus autogenic terrace formation can be evaluated within a single river system.

Typology of rice-based cropping systems for improved soil carbon management: Capturing smallholder farming opportunities and constraints in Dinajpur, Bangladesh	GEODERMA REGIONAL			English	Article						Farming typology; Cropping intensity; Crop residue; Land inundation; Gleysols; Planosols	ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; INTENSITY; REGION	Characterization of smallholder land resource endowment and cropping practice can assist in the implementation of a more tailored approach to Soil Carbon Management (SCM). Land resource and cropping practice data, stratified by soil physiography, was collected through a survey involving 83 farmers in four upazila of Dinajpur district, Bangladesh. The aim was to determine a farming system typology based on smallholder land resource endowment and cropping practices, and to consider the likelihood of soil carbon improvement under the typology. A Cluster Analysis was performed using data on seven variables that combined land resource (physiography, land type, landholding, farm size) and cropping practice (cropping system, cropping intensity, crop rotation) characteristics to determine a farming system typology. The resulting typology, referred to as Soil Carbon Improvement Likelihood (SCIL), identified three different farming system types. These were then assessed with regard to their potential for improving soil carbon in these systems. The most prevalent SCIL, Medium SCIL (Type 1, 42%) consists of the maize-rice, wheat-rice and veg.-rice cropping systems in the HL areas of the Piedmont plain, Floodplain and Terrace. It is managed with high fertilization, low crop rotation and low to medium crop residue retention. The next most prevalent SCIL, Low SCIL (Type 3, 30%) consists of a rice-rice cropping system in the HL and MHL areas of the Piedmont plain, Floodplain and Terrace, and is managed with medium fertilization, no crop rotation and limited residue retention. The least prevalent farming system type, the High SCIL (Type 2, 28%) consists of crop-diversified and mustard-rice cropping systems in the MHL areas of the Floodplain and Terrace, which is managed with high fertilization, crop rotation and high crop residue retention. This study showed that cropping systems with higher crop intensification and high retention of crop residue, on the Floodplain soil physiography and MHL land inundation type, provide the greatest opportunity for improved SCM, but were represented by less than one-third of the farmers (n = 20) in this survey. These farmers were also mainly private landholders. The typology presented here can potentially serve as a practical framework for delineating cropping systems and management under particular land resource settings to undertake more targeted innovations and SCM priorities in Rice-based Cropping Systems.

Reservoir effects on the downstream flow regime are normally performed by comparing the pre-dam and post-dam frequencies of certain streamflow indicators, such as floods and droughts. In this study, a rainfall-reservoir composite index (RRCI) is developed to precisely quantify reservoir impacts on downstream flood frequency under a framework of a covariate-based nonstationary flood frequency analysis using the Bayesian inference method. The RRCI is derived from a combination of both a reservoir index (RI) for measuring the effects of reservoir storage capacity and a rainfall index. More precisely, the OR joint (the type of possible joint events based on the OR operator) exceedance probability (OR-JEP) of certain scheduling-related variables selected out of five variables that describe the multiday antecedent rainfall input (MARI) is used to measure the effects of antecedent rainfall on reservoir operation. Then, the RI-dependent or RRCI-dependent distribution parameters and five distributions, the gamma, Weibull, lognormal, Gumbel, and generalized extreme value, are used to analyze the annual maximum daily flow (AMDF) of the Ankang, Huangjiagang, and Huangzhuang gauging stations of the Han River, China. A phenomenon is observed in which although most of the floods that peak downstream of reservoirs have been reduced in magnitude by upstream reservoirs, some relatively large flood events have still occurred, such as at the Huangzhuang station in 1983. The results of nonstationary flood frequency analysis show that, in comparison to the RI, the RRCI that combines both the RI and the OR-JEP resulted in a much better explanation for such phenomena of flood occurrences downstream of reservoirs. A Bayesian inference of the 100-year return level of the AMDF shows that the optimal RRCIdependent distribution, compared to the RI-dependent one, results in relatively smaller estimated values. However, exceptions exist due to some low OR-JEP values. In addition, it provides a smaller uncertainty range. This study highlights the necessity of including antecedent rainfall effects, in addition to the effects of reservoir storage capacity, on reservoir operation to assess the reservoir effects on downstream flood frequency. This analysis can provide a more comprehensive approach for downstream flood risk management under the impacts of reservoirs.

Storm flooding is an extreme weather phenomenon that not only impacts the health of the environment but also worsens the spread of pathogens. This poses a significant challenge to public health security. However, there is still a lack of research on how different levels of storm flooding affect susceptible enteric infectious diseases over time.MethodsData on enteric infectious diseases, storm flooding events, and meteorology were collected for Changsha, Hunan Province, between 2016 and 2020. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to identify the enteric infectious diseases that are susceptible to storm flooding. Then, the lagged effects of different levels of storm flooding on susceptible enteric infectious diseases were analyzed using a distributed lag nonlinear model.ResultsThere were eleven storm flooding events in Changsha from 2016 to 2020, concentrated in June and July. 37,882 cases of enteric infectious diseases were reported. During non-flooding days, the daily incidence rates of typhoid/paratyphoid and bacillary dysentery were 0.3/100,000 and 0.1/100,000, respectively. During flooding days, the corresponding rates increased to 2.0/100,000 and 0.8/100,000, respectively. The incidence rates of both diseases showed statistically significant differences between non-flooding and flooding days. Correlation analysis shows that the best lags for typhoid/paratyphoid and bacillary dysentery relative to storm flooding events may be 1 and 3 days. The results of the distributed lag nonlinear model showed that typhoid/paratyphoid had the highest cumulative RR values of 2.86 (95% CI: 1.71-4.76) and 8.16 (95% CI: 2.93-22.67) after 4 days of general flooding and heavy flooding, respectively; and bacillary dysentery had the highest cumulative RR values of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.40-2.35) and 3.31 (95% CI: 1.97-5.55) after 5 days of general flooding and heavy flooding, respectively.ConclusionsTyphoid/paratyphoid and bacillary dysentery are sensitive enteric infectious diseases related to storm flooding in Changsha. There is a lagging effect of storm flooding on the onset of typhoid/paratyphoid and bacillary dysentery, with the best lagging periods being days 1 and 3, respectively. The cumulative risk of typhoid/paratyphoid and bacillary dysentery was highest at 4/5 days lag, respectively. The higher of storm flooding, the higher the risk of disease, which suggests that the authorities should take appropriate preventive and control measures before and after storm flooding.

A 2-year telemetry study was conducted to assess the efficiency of temporary measures to enhance the safety and speed of juvenile salmon passage through the Poutes dam (Allier River, France). 124 smolts were tracked through the reservoir and downstream of the dam, during implementation of turbine modulation and/or shutdown during night and reservoir level lowering. Level lowering significantly reduced median residence time from 3.4 days to 4.4 hours. However, even with high spill during turbine modulation, the risk of smolt being drawn toward the turbines was increased at low reservoir level due to the site's configuration, greater proximity to the surface and weak repulsive effect of the rack. Moreover, results revealed that a substantial proportion of smolts can migrate during daytime and twilight during floods, even at the beginning of the migration period. Thus targeted turbine shutdown has a good potential to protect smolts, but implementation requires studies taking account of site specificities and a flexible approach. Le developpement de regles de gestion pour ameliorer la devalaison des smolts de saumon au niveau des grandes centrales hydroelectriques est essentiel pour reduire les mortalites et les retards de migration. Un suivi par telemetrie a ete mene pour tester l'efficacite de mesures temporaires mises en oe uvre au barrage de Poutes (riviere Allier, France). Au total, 124 individus ont ete suivis depuis l'amont de la retenue jusqu'a l'aval du barrage pendant la mise en oe uvre de modulation ou d'arret du turbinage et l'abaissement du niveau de la retenue. L'abaissement a significativement diminue le temps de residence des smolts (mediane de 3.4 jours a niveau haut contre 4.4 heures a niveau bas). En revanche, cela a augmente le risque d'entrainement vers les turbines en raison de la configuration du site, d'une plus grande proximite de la prise d'eau avec la surface et d'un faible pouvoir repulsif de la grille. De plus, une proportion importante des poissons peut migrer de jour et au crepuscule durant les crues, meme en debut de periode de migration. Les arrets cibles de turbinage ont une efficacite potentielle elevee, mais leur mise en oe uvre necessite des etudes tenant compte des specificites de chaque site.

Previous studies had explored the effect of land-use type on waterlogging in relatively small watersheds. Few, however, have comprehensively revealed the relative contributions of the environmental and anthropogenic factors to urban waterlogging concerning different scales of analysis. Indeed what is less known, are the dominant factors and the appropriate scale of analysis. To overcome this limitation, a novel method that integrates the stepwise regression model with hierarchical partitioning analysis is presented. The purpose is to investigate the complex mechanism of urban waterlogging by identifying the relative contribution of each environmental and anthropogenic factor and the stability linking waterlogging to influencing factors at multiple scales of analysis (i.e. 1 km, 2 km, 3 km, 4 km, and 5 km). We consider waterlogging events in the central urban districts of Guangzhou (PR China) from 2009 to 2015 as a case study. The results show that the spatial distribution of waterlogging events in the central urban area presents a strong agglomeration pattern. The waterlogging hot spots are mainly concentrated in the historical area of Guangzhou. Under all analysis scales, we find that the percent cover of urban green spaces (44.74%), percent cover of residential area (41.03%), and slope.std (36.85%) both have a dominant contribution to urban waterlogging, which suggests the importance of land cover composition in determining urban waterlogging. However, the relative contribution and dominant factors of waterlogging varied across different analysis scales, presenting a strong scale effect. Under a small analysis scale (1 km), the topography factors (slope.std and relative elevation) are confirmed as the dominant variables; however, with the increase of analysis scale, the influence of land cover composition (greenspace, residence area, grassland) and land cover spatial configuration (LPI, AI, Cohesion index) on waterlogging magnitude is greater than other factors. This finding provides additional insights that the urban waterlogging can be alleviated by balancing the relative composition of land cover features as well as by optimizing their spatial configuration. Since the optimal statistical scale for urban waterlogging studies only worked for specific influencing factors, the appropriate analysis scale for urban waterlogging study should be determined by the characteristics of study areas. This study has the capability to extend our scientific understanding of the complex mechanisms of waterlogging in the highly urbanized coastal city, providing useful support for the prevention and management of urban waterlogging.

In a previous publication, the general landscape configuration in the vicinity of ancient Phaistos was reconstructed using a palaeoenvironmental approach, from the Proto-Palatial period (ca. 2000 BCE) to the Late-Proto Geometric period (ca. 8th cent. BCE). However, the physiography of the landscape, its hydrology and vegetation history remained uncertain for the later archaeological periods. In the present study, additional radiocarbon dates (8) together with pollen, mollusc and sedimentological analyses (CM diagram) were conducted on previously documented sediment cores. These new results enable us to reconstruct in greater detail the landscape history from the Early Archaic period to Late Byzantine times. The results indicate the continuous presence of swampland from the Proto-Geometric period (10th cent. BCE) probably until the initial stages of the Classical period (5th cent. BCE). Subsequently, during the Classical and Hellenistic periods, there was a short interval of alluvial input of terriginous sediments (not exceeding two centuries in duration) which is directly linked with the complete drying up and drainage of the swampland. We address the issue of the possible climatic origin of this abrupt hydrological change, especially in relation to regional climate change and the sedimentary history of adjacent rivers and streams. Tectonic activity in the area is also an important factor and can be invoked as a potential environmental influence. Anthropogenic factors are also considered, even though there is no direct archaeological evidence of drainage in the western Messara Plain during the Archaic and Classical periods. Finally, from Roman times to the Early Byzantine period, floodplain development prevailed in the area and ponds formed locally, in particular from the Late Hellenistic to Early Byzantine periods; this was related to the climatic conditions of the Roman Warm period. Pollen analysis reveals an open forested landscape during the time interval under investigation, within which domesticated plants such as Olea (olive) were present. However, the representation of Olea decreases continuously from the Late Geometric period to Byzantine times, probably indicating much lower intensity of land use than during Minoan times and possibly also related to the generally colder climatic conditions in Crete from the 8th cent. BCE until the 1st Cent. CE. During this latter interval, there is also the first pollen analytical evidence of Vitis sp.

Influence of atmospheric rivers in the occurrence of devastating flood associated with extreme precipitation events over Chennai using different reanalysis data sets	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Atmospheric Rivers; Integrated water vapor transport; Heavy precipitation; South-eastern Indian region	RAINFALL EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDIA; NORTH; WINTER; OCEAN; TEMPERATURE; TRANSPORTS; SATELLITE; FREQUENCY	The main focus of the present study is to examine the presence of Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) in the occurrence of Chennai (13.5 degrees N, 80.5 degrees E) flood event over Tamil Nadu which is south-eastern part of Indian peninsular region of India during November to December 2015. The vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) algorithm was used for the detection of ARs using three different reanalysis products, namely, the NCEP-NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research), NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). It is noticed that the occurrence of heavy precipitation events (HPEs) prior to the flood in the Chennai city, has been in good agreement with the presence of ARs during that time. The distribution from TRMM-3B42RT, TRMM-3B42 are validated with the with in situ rain gauge observations over the Chennai city. We have conducted quantitative analysis of IVT and their impact on heavy precipitation events and flood occurred over Chennai city. It is seen that MERRA reanalysis could be able to provide better presence of ARs. The study mainly reveals that persistent ARs of > 18 h resulted in extremely heavy precipitation and lead to associated flood over Chennai. Also, the atmospheric conditions, ARs and rainfall simulated from Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW) show good agreement with reanalysis and observations. Over the given reference period 1979-2015, correlation between IVT and HPEs is statistically significant at 99.5% confidence level. But the correlation between IVT during persistent ARs and corresponding HPEs is statistically significant at 90% confidence level. A large fraction of HPEs occur after ARs, with a small portion of ARs would lead to HPEs. The Chennai gird historical rainfall data is suitably fitted by Extreme Value Distribution (EVD) models. Inference model using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was applied on EVD considering their impact on the shape parameter and the confidence interval width. A Non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis, was used to determine the strength of association between the precipitation extremes and IVT. The influence of the location and the scale parameter in the GEV model on different return levels (2-year, 20-year, and 100-year) are explicitly described. The returnlevel threshold values are found to change with NT considerably. This study advocates that the detection of ARs can be used as important proxy in identifying the likelihood of occurrence of heavy precipitation/flash flood events for a given location using reanalysis data sets.

This poses several challenges to its cultivation due to erratic rainfall resulting in drought, flood, and other abiotic stresses of varying intensity. Dry/direct-sown rice (DSR) has emerged as a water-saving/climate-smart alternative to transplanted rice (TPR). The performance of a rice cultivar on growing by different methods of planting under varying environmental conditions varies considerably. However, the molecular basis of the observed phenotypic plasticity of rice to varying environmental conditions is still elusive. Resilience to various environmental fluctuations is important to ensure sustainable rice production in the present era of global climate change. Our observations on exclusively up-regulated genes in leaf of Nagina 22 (N 22) grown by dry/direct-sowing and subjected to drought stress at panicle initiation stage (compared to that in leaf of IR 64), and another set of genes exclusively down-regulated in leaf of N 22 (compared to that in leaf of IR 64) indicate important roles of leaf in stress resilience. A large number of genes down-regulated exclusively in root of N 22 on dry/direct-sowing subjected to drought stress indicates a major contribution of roots in stress tolerance. The genes for redox-homeostasis, transcription factors, stress signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and epigenetic modifications play important roles in making N 22 better adapted to DSR conditions. More importantly, the involvement of genes in rendering genetic plasticity to N 22 under changing environmental conditions was confirmed by reversal of the method of planting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on decoding the molecular basis of genetic plasticity of rice grown by two different methods of planting subjected to drought stress at the reproductive stage of plant growth. This might help in DSR varietal development program to enhance water-productivity, conserve natural resources, and minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, thus achieving the objectives of negative-emission agriculture.

However, longtime series datasets for these are generally unavailable. The spatiotemporal dynamics of annual paddy rice and cropping intensity over the last 20 years have rarely been investigated at the continental scale. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to generate a publicly available database on annual PRA and CI and investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of annual PRA and CI across the Asian monsoon region (AMR) over the last 20 years. METHODS: The annual PRA and cropping CI maps at 500-m resolution across the AMR from 2000 to 2020 were generated by the improved methods based on remote sensing data from multiple sources. Also, the spatiotemporal trends of paddy rice fields and cropping intensity were further analyzed based on Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the resultant annual PRA and CI were correlated with that based on field samples and census data. They were also consistent with the spatial distribution of existing high-resolution products in a specific year and region. The paddy rice planting area increased significantly (p < 0.05) in northeastern China and northwestern India and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in southern China during 2000-2020. Single- and double-cropping were dominant in the AMR. Both double-cropping and triple- cropping increased significantly (p < 0.05) during 2001-2020. Single-cropping was converted to double- cropping in approximately 198.1 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the North China Plain and northern India. And double-cropping was converted to triple-cropping in approximately 9.5 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the Mekong Delta in Southeast Asia. However, the cropping intensity in some regions such as southern China declined from 2001 to 2020. SIGNIFICANCE: The results and datasets of this study will be useful for providing fundamental information for designing scientific policies, food security, and climate change, providing key data for yield forecasting, crop model building, and greenhouse gas estimating.

Within these discourses the 'public' is seen as central to the creation and implementation of appropriate interventions. The role of public engagement in societal transformation while essential, is also complex and often poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to enhance our understanding regarding public engagement and to address the often superficial and shallow policy discourse on this topic. Main text The paper offers a review of evolving literature to map emergent public engagement in processes of transition and change. We adopt a pragmatic approach towards literature retrieval and analysis which enables a cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral review. We use a scoping review process and the three spheres of transformation framework (designated as the practical, political and personal spheres) to explore trends within this complex research field. The review draws from literature from the last two decades in the Irish context and looks at emergence and evolving spaces of public engagement within various systems of change including energy, food, coastal management and flood adaptation, among others. Conclusions The results highlight the siloed and fragmented way in which public engagement in transitions is carried and we propose a more cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach which depends on bringing into dialogue often contrasting theories and perspectives. The paper also illustrates some shifting engagement approaches. For instance, nexus articles between the practical and political spheres suggest deeper forms of public engagement beyond aggregated consumer behaviour to align technological delivery with institutional and societal contexts. While most articles in the practical sphere draw largely on techno-economic insights this influence and cross-disciplinarity is likely to draw in further innovations. Nexus articles between the political and personal sphere are also drawing on shifting ideas of public engagement and largely stress the need to disrupt reductive notions of engagement and agency within our institutions. Many of these articles call attention to problems with top-down public engagement structures and in various ways show how they often undermine and marginalise different groups.

This study analyzed and for the first time modeled a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) event in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh. Glacier and glacial lakes changes were quantified using remote sensing data supplemented with field observations. Glacier ice-thickness and glacier-bed overdeepenings were modeled using a shear-stress based model, GlabTop (Glacier-bed Topography). The reconstruction of the 2014 GLOF and the potential hazard assessment of Gya Lake were carried out using the hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS; results were validated against ground-collected data. Temporal evaluation of satellite data revealed a 45.6% loss in the total glacier area between 1969 and 2019. The earliest snow-free image available for the region shows that a progladal lake existed as early as 1969 with an area of 3.06 ha. The lake has expanded to similar to 11 ha in 2019. Results from the GlabTop model suggest that the lake could grow further up to 12 ha in the future. Field-based geomorphic indicators suggest that the 2014 GLOF event resulted from a piping failure of the frontal moraine destroying numerous agricultural fields, some buildings, downstream infrastructure, and eroded natural channel embankments. The reconstruction of the event revealed that 25% of the lake waters drained out with a peak discharge of 470 m(3) s(-1) , inundating an area of similar to 4 km(2) around Gya Village. However, a complete breaching of the terminal moraine could result in an event that would be 5.5 times larger than the 2014 GLOF. Therefore, this study could be useful not only in planning disaster-resilient infrastructure around proglacial lake environments in the cold-arid Ladakh but also in framing mitigation plans to reduce risk for vulnerable downstream communities.

Geographical location of the country in the foothill of Himalayan system and in the mouth of north Bay of Bengal make it to experience frequent extreme environmental events such as flood, cyclone, draught, river erosion, sea level rise, salinity etc. The coastal region of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change and climate induced natural disasters. This study identifies the potential climate induced hazards, their vulnerability, capacity, associated risk and explores the potential strategies to reduce the disaster risk. This study was carried out in Uttar Bedkashi Union, Koyra Upazila under Khulna District in south west coastal region of Bangladesh. The information has been collected through individual level and key informant interview, focus group discussion, life history from local people to explore the context of the disaster risk and how they perceived it from their experiences. The study revealed that flooding as a result of high tide and salinity intrusion were the most prominent hazards followed by riverbank erosion and cyclone associated storm. Vulnerability assessment showed that cyclone associated storm surge was the major cause of vulnerabilities in the study area which followed by flooding and riverbank erosion. On the other hand, capacity assessment showed that community people have less capacity to deal with the multi-hazards risk. This study also revealed that riverbank erosion poses the highest risk in the study area followed by cyclone associated storm surge, flooding, and salinity intrusion. The study suggests some potential DRR strategy such as build disaster resilient house using indigenous and scientific knowledge, build or improve embankments, build or improve the communication roads, improve rain water harvesting system, provision of community-based health care center, create alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunity such as self-sustaining agriculture systems and further development of sustainable shrimp farming. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for preparing an effective disaster risk mitigation plan by decision-makers. Further in-depth research on potential risk reduction options will be analyzed to measure efficiency and effectiveness.

In recent decades, climate changes and human activities have caused great impacts on the spatial distribution of the earth's water resources and the spatiotemporal process of the surface water cycle, which has caused a series of ecological crises and environmental problems, such as the drying-up of inland lakes, the disappearance of the oasis, water shortage or flooding and water pollution. Therefore, monitoring and fully understanding the dynamic changes of lakes is of great scientific significance for grasping regional water balance, water resources management, and sustainable development of the ecological environment. In this study, we focus on using multi-source satellite data on the estimation of water volume and multi-timescale variations analysis for large scale lakes. This study combines the problems in the practical application of "African Water Action", taking the largest lake in Africa, Lake Victoria, as the study area, and utilizes long-term serial multi-source satellite data of the past 15 years (2003-2017), including Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Jason-1/-2/-3 and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to perform the comprehensive analysis on the water volume change estimation. Firstly, the satellite altimetry data of Jason-1/-2/-3 and MODIS imagery was used to calculate series of water level, and to extract series of water surface area, respectively. On this basis, a more accurate regression model between the area and water level variation (Delta H) was constructed. Then, the model between water volume variation (Delta V) and Delta H, derived from area-Delta Hmodel, was applied to calculate the relative water volume of Lake Victoria. Meanwhile, terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes between 2003 and 2016, derived from GRACE data, were also used for a comparative verification of the Delta Vresults. The results show the long-term series change trends of Delta Vand the TWS are the same. Finally, the multi-timescale analysis of water volume changes was carried out on different time scales, such as the inter-annual, inter-monthly, and variation period.

Though it is impossible to avoid them, losses and damage of hazards (e.g., floods, cyclones, and earthquakes) could be efficiently reduced by reducing household vulnerability with appropriate measures. This study aims to quantitatively measure the household vulnerability of flood hazards as a mitigation tool. It also proposed a unique approach to quantify flood-hazard household vulnerability, and shows its application in the flood prone city of Dhaka as an example case. Data were collected from both slum and non-slum areas to cover the entire urban habitat, and to compare their level of flood vulnerability. A total of 300 households were surveyed by structured questionnaire on the basis of five factors (economic, social, environmental, structural. and institutional) of flood vulnerability. The analytical hierarchy process (AMP) was applied to measure individual household vulnerability scores by using the relative weightage of variables and indicators with proper standardisation. Analytical results demonstrated that 63.06% slum and 20.02% non-slum households were highly vulnerable to floods. In addition, this paper determined and assessed responsible factors for household flood vulnerability in Dhaka. For structural vulnerability, results exhibited that 82% of slum households were highly vulnerable, and 95.3% of non-slum households were moderately vulnerable. Socially, 67.3% of slum and 78.7% of non-slum households were moderately and low-vulnerable. The majority of slum and non-slum households (84% and 59.3%, respectively) showed high and moderate vulnerability with respect to economic vulnerability. Moreover, 69.3% of slum and 65.3% of non-slum household institutional vulnerability levels were high. Of slum inhabitants. 63.3% were environmentally at high risk, and 78% of non-slum habitats were in the low-vulnerability category. However. as an effective tool to measure location-specific vulnerability, it is applicable for the measuring vulnerability of other cities in the world with proper customisation. On the basis of this study, future research could be conducted with more factors, variables, and indicators of human vulnerability to natural or artificial hazards/disasters. Future work may provide a better reflection of the vulnerability status of single/multiple hazard(s)/disaster(s).

Location Upper Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, UK. Methods Data on environment, macrophytes and invertebrates were assembled for three basins of a large central lake and its satellite floodplain lakes via field surveys and palaeolimnological analyses. Space-time interaction analyses of palaeoecological data were compared pre-1950 and post-1950. Multivariate analyses examined how connectivity, environment and zebra mussels influenced contemporary lake communities, and explain their divergence from historical communities in the past. Results Pre-1950, we found high community variation across sites and low within-lake variation in macrophytes, but progressive eutrophication accentuated within-lake community variation after 1950. Partitioning analysis showed larger effects of connectivity than nutrient enrichment on contemporary macrophyte composition, while local effects structured invertebrate communities. Three clusters of lakes were revealed according to variation in macrophyte composition, isolation from the central lake and nutrient enrichment: Group 1- the central lake and six nearby lakes were meso-eutrophic (TP = 66.7 +/- 47.6 mu g/L; TN = 0.79 +/- 0.41 mg/L) and had the highest zebra mussel abundances and organismal biodiversity; Group 2- Eight eutrophic (TP = 112 +/- 36.6 mu g/L; TN = 1.25 +/- 0.5 mg/L) and connected lakes; Group 3- Seven isolated and hypertrophic (TP = 163.2 +/- 101.5 mu g/L; TN = 1.55 +/- 0.3 mg/L) lakes. Pre-1950 palaeolimnological data for macrophytes and invertebrates for 5 lakes and a basin in the central lake most resembled extant lake communities of Group 1. However, palaeo-records revealed that macrophytes and invertebrates subsequently converged towards those of Groups 2 and 3. Main conclusions Our study reveals that the central "mother" lake acts as a hub for preserving biodiversity via shared hydrological connectivity with satellite lakes and high zebra mussel abundances. These may buffer the impoverishing effects of eutrophication and sustain unexpectedly high biodiversity in the short term. Such protective buffering, however, cannot be relied upon indefinitely to conserve biodiversity.

Urban pluvial flooding often consists of street flooding and/or flooding of combined sewerage systems, leading to contamination of the floodwater with several gastrointestinal and/or respiratory pathogens. An increase in flooding events therefore pose a health risk to those exposed to urban floodwater. We studied the association between exposure to pluvial floodwater and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and acute respiratory infection (ARI).MethodsWe performed a retrospective, cross-sectional survey during the summer of 2015 in 60 locations in the Netherlands with reported flooding. Two weeks after the flooding, questionnaires were sent to households in these locations, collecting data on self-reported AGE and ARI and information on floodwater exposure in the previous 2 weeks. Multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression models, accounting for the clustered data structure, were used to identify risk factors for AGE and ARI.ResultsIn total, 699 households with 1,656 participants (response rate 21%) returned the questionnaire. Contact with floodwater was significantly associated with AGE (aOR 4.2, 95%CI 2.1-8.4) and ARI (aOR 3.3, 95%CI 2.0-5.4). Risk factors for AGE were skin contact with floodwater (aOR 4.0, 95%CI 1.8-9.0), performing post-flooding cleaning operations (aOR 8.6, 95%CI 3.5-20.9) and cycling through floodwater (aOR 2.3, 95%CI 1.0-5.0). Skin contact with floodwater (aOR 3.6, 95%CI 1.9-6.9) and performing post-flooding cleaning operations (aOR 5.5, 95%CI 3.0-10.3) were identified as risk factors for ARI.ConclusionsResults suggest an association between direct exposure to pluvial floodwater and AGE and ARI. As it is predicted that the frequency of pluvial flooding events will increase in the future, there is a need for flood-proof solutions in urban development and increased awareness among stakeholders and the public about the potential health risks. Future prospective studies are recommended to confirm our results.

The objective of this study is to review the variation trends and distribution patterns in the periods of adverse and extreme weather events that are expected to impact on inland waterways transport (IWT) on the Yangtze River. The frequency of severe weather events, together with the changes in their spatial extension and intensity, is analyzed based on the ERA-Interim datasets (1979-2017) and the GHCNDEX dataset (1979-2017), as well as the research progresses and important events (2004-2016) affecting the navigation environment. The impacts of extreme weather events on IWT accidents and phenomena of extreme weather (e.g., thunderstorms, lightning, hail, and tornadoes) that affect the navigation environment are also analyzed and discussed. The results show that: (1) the sections located in the plain climate zone is affected by extreme weather in every season, especially strong winds and heat waves; (2) the sections located in the hilly mountain climate zone is affected particularly by spring extreme phenomena, especially heat waves; (3) the sections located in the Sichuan Basin climate zone is dominated by the extreme weather phenomena in autumn, except cold waves; (4) the occurrence frequency of potential flood risk events is relatively high under rainstorm conditions and wind gusts almost affect the navigation environment of the Jiangsu and Shanghai sections in every year; (5) the heat wave indices (TXx, TR, and WSDI) tend to increase and the temperature of the coldest day of the year gradually increases; (6) the high occurrences of IWT accidents need to be emphasized by relevant departments, caused by extreme weather during the dry season; and (7) the trends and the degree of attention of extreme weather events affecting IWT are ranked as: heat wave > heavy rainfall > wind gust > cold spell > storm. Understanding the seasonal and annual frequency of occurrence of extreme weather events has reference significance for regional management of the Yangtze River.

The objective of this paper, is to construct a simple and early warning system, serving for flash floods risk management in the ungauged catchments of the Loess Plateau in China, and offer a reference for flash flood warning in other areas in the world. Considering the absence of hydrological data in the ungauged catchments, the early warning system for flash floods is established by combining the regional or watershed isograms of hydrological parameters and local empirical formulas. Therein, rainfall and water stage/flow are used as warning indices for real-time risk estimation of flash flood. For early warning, the disaster water stage was first determined according to the protected objects (e.g., residents and buildings), namely the critical water stage. The critical flow (flow threshold), was calculated based on the water stage, and the established relationship between water stage and flow using the cross-sectional measured data. Then, according to the flow frequency curve of the design flood, the frequency of critical flow was ascertained. Assuming that the rainfall and the flood have the same frequency, the critical rainfall threshold was calculated through the design rainstorm with the same frequency of the design flood. Due to the critical rainfall threshold being sensitive with different soil conditions, the design flood and frequency curve of flood flow were calculated under different soil conditions, and thus the rainfall threshold was given under different soil condition for early warning of the flash flood disaster. Taking two sections in Zichang County (within the Loess Plateau) as an example, we set the rainfall and water stage/flow thresholds to trigger immediate or preparation signals for the migration of the population along the river. The application of this method to the 7.26 flood events in 2017 in China, shows that the early warning system is feasible. It is expected that this simple early warning system can provide early warnings of flash floods in ungauged catchments in the Loess Plateau and other similar areas.

A correct prediction of 100-year return levels could encourage better land planning, sizing works correctly according to the expected extreme events and managing emergencies more consciously through real-time alerts. In the recent period, it has been observed that the return levels predicted by the main forecasting methods for extreme rainfall events have turned out to be lower than observed within a few years. In this context, a model widely used in the literature, the generalised extreme value (GEV) with the "block maxima" approach, was used to assess the dependence of this model on the length of the collected precipitation time series and the possible addition of years with extreme events of great intensity. A total of 131 rainfall time series were collected from the Adriatic slope in central Italy comparing two periods: one characterised by 70 years of observations (1951-2020), the other by only 30 years (1991-2020). At the same time, a decision was made to analyse what the effect might be-in terms of the 100-year return level-of introducing an additional extreme event to the 1991-2020 historical series, in this case an event that actually occurred in the area on 15 September 2022. The results obtained were rather surprising, with a clear indication that the values of the 100-year return level calculated by GEV vary according to the length of the historical series examined. In particular, the shorter time series 1991-2020 provided higher return level values than those obtained from the 1951-2020 period; furthermore, the addition of the extreme event of 2022 generated even higher return level values. It follows that, as shown by the extreme precipitation events that have occurred in recent years, it is more appropriate to consider a rather short period because the ongoing climate change does not allow true estimates to be obtained using longer time series, which are preferred in the scientific literature, or possibly questioning the real reliability of the GEV model.

Risk assessment and management of vulnerable areas to flash flood hazards in arid regions using remote sensing and GIS-based knowledge-driven techniques	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flash flood mapping; Remote sensing; GIS; AHP; NQC; Egypt	COHERENT CHANGE DETECTION; POTENTIAL AREAS; SENSED DATA; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SCALE; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; MODELS; INDEX; BASIN	Earth Observation from space has allowed characterizing, detecting, and managing natural hazards in spatiotemporal scale. Flash flood is the most frequent natural disaster that causes destruction to human lives, the economy, and infrastructure. Thus, developing a flash flood hazard zone (FFHZ) map is significant for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment and management to minimize its harmful effects, particularly in residential areas, because of climate change. Therefore, in this article, ten parameters derived from satellite images, including lithology, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Stream Transport Index (STI), Terrain Roughness Index (TRI), drainage density (Dd), distance to river, radar intensity map, and rainfall distribution map, were fused to predict the flood-vulnerable areas through GIS-based overlay analysis after normalization and assigning weight by applying Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP). The findings allowed for the identification of the most vulnerable areas and provided an explanation for the flood's effects on New Qena City (NQC). The output FFHZs of the Wadi Qena Basin (WQB) were divided into six hazard zones, i.e., extreme hazard (6.86%), very strong (15.04%), strong (18.74%), moderate (22.58%), low (22.80%), and very low (13.98%) susceptibility. Furthermore, approximately 35% of the under-construction NQC is subject to the extreme to very serious hazards, as opposed to the extension area to NQC east of the Qena-Safaga Road. Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) change detection coherence (CCD) and spatiotemporal analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data revealed steady changes in vegetation and infrastructure from 1984 to present. Based on GIS analyses about 10, and 14% of the NQC can be inundated if the flood extends 500, and 1000 m around the flood canal, respectively. Thus, several strategies were advised to safeguard the development projects, particularly the residential sections of the under construction NQC, including erecting four dams with a total capacity of 300 million m(3), reinforce the dam at Wadi Shahadein, constructing concrete chevron bunds along the flood zone, and extending the depths of the flooding canal.

Water-level drawdowns are a management option for improving water quality in shallow, eutrophic lakes, but how much water levels should be reduced and what abiotic and biotic mechanisms can be expected to reduce the adverse effects of eutrophication are unclear. 2. We conducted a study with two experimental pools (10 m wide, 30 m long, and approx. 2.5 m water depth) in a before-after-control-impact design to examine whether water-level drawdowns could influence surface water quality and bottom-water conditions, as well as how physicochemical and biological variables contributed to improvements. In the experiment, we fertilised the pools to increase productivity and induce hypoxia, and then reduced water levels four times in increments of 0.5 m. 3. Our experiment using high-frequency sensors showed that water-level drawdowns could decrease cyanobacterial blooms and alleviate hypoxia relatively quickly by changing physicochemical conditions. Water-level reductions quickly increased bottom light illuminance, increased bottom-water temperatures, and weakened stratification. The result was a dramatic increase in bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentrations. 4. Water-level drawdowns also decreased the relative fluorescence of chlorophyll and phycocyanin, probably because of a decrease of internal nutrient loadings from sediment. Total nitrogen and NH4-N concentrations in the water column decreased after water-level reductions, and NH4-N and PO4-P concentrations in sediment pore waters were reduced in the water-level treatment. 5. Periphyton biomass did not change after the water-level drawdowns. Water-level manipulations increased the abundance of cyclopoids and calanoids but not large cladocerans. These biological processes responded slowly to water-level drawdowns and are unlikely to have contributed to water quality improvement. 6. Overall, the size of the water-level reduction required to start changing water quality was 0.5-1.0 m. Our results suggested that a temporary reduction in water-level of 20%-40% of the depth might help to suppress cyanobacterial blooms and hypoxia in shallow lakes, reservoirs, and agricultural ponds. Such water-level management may help resolve conflicting demands for water and may be incorporated into management plans for flood control.

J	Karamouz, M; Zoghi, A; Mahmoudi, S				Karamouz, Mohammad; Zoghi, Ali; Mahmoudi, Sadaf			Flood Modeling in Coastal Cities and Flow through Vegetated BMPs: Conceptual Design	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Partial frequency analysis; Hydrologic modeling; Flood mitigation; Best management practices (BMPs); Nature-based solutions	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; WAVE ATTENUATION; HYDRODYNAMICS; PROTECTION; BREAKING; SURGE; REEF	Undeniably, climate-change-induced sea-level rise has served as a powerful driving force for the occurrence of coastal storms more severe than ever before. Low-lying metropolitan coastal areas, in particular, have become increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding as a result of the rapid expansion of urbanization along flood-prone areas. Safeguarding coastal communities from the repercussions of flooding through the utilization of best management practices (BMPs) is one of the most effective ways of alleviating the situation. However, solely relying on inshore BMPs might not be the best possible approach when the storm event's intensity can be reduced before the storm reaches the shoreline through the installment of offshore BMPs. Moreover, many recent studies have confirmed the cost-effectiveness and usefulness of natural elements, especially when combined with engineering solutions. This paper assesses the overall suitability and effectiveness of various combinations of nature-based inshore and offshore BMPs for coastal flood mitigation of storms with different intensities with applications to the Southern Brooklyn area in New York City. Moreover, inevitable conditions stemming from climate variability and change have made the assumption of stationary recurrence of extreme events unreliable. Furthermore, historical events of remarkable impacts have not been considered differently in the attainment of the flood design values. Thus, as one of the main objectives of this study, and in order to consider both, a nonstationary partial frequency analysis is utilized, including the major historical storms jointly with the precipitation data in the study area to obtain 100-year flood design values. To achieve the goals of the study, first, the offshore simulation was carried out using the Delft3D hydrodynamic model, developed by Deltares, in order to find the water level hydrograph for the ungauged areas of interest, with and without offshore BMPs followed by the simulation of the flood events on the inland coastal area using gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA), a module of the watershed modeling system (WMS) developed by the USACE, to assess the effectiveness of inshore BMPs. The proposed scenarios are tested against Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene, and the 100-year flood hydrographs. The results showed a remarkable coastal flood wave height and water level reduction when integrating offshore and inshore green BMPs.

In the environment, erosion, landslide, floods, water pollution, illegal solid waste disposal, damaged drainage structures with disconnected parts, clandestine sewage or effluent discharge, among others, can be cited as impacts of urbanization. In this context, watersheds can be used as a foundation for urban development with certain scales of prioritization. In literature, the discussion for watershed prioritization was mostly found based only on computational methods and models, and does not include the important influence of field investigation and analysis of the headwaters. This is an option for urban areas, since most urban rivers are considered as headwaters (order 1). Also, erosion and poorly managed drainage systems can be obstructed by vegetation and may not be seen from satellite images. The aim of this work was to integrate on a GIS environment a Rapid Environmental Impact Assessment Matrix analysis with data based on basin morphology and field investigation of vegetation, erosion, drainage infrastructure, and presence of solid waste and wastewater in the urban headwaters of a medium size city in Brazil to create an urban watershed management prioritization order. A field survey was carried in 27 urban headwaters and digital analysis of the physical characteristics of the watersheds was using the QSWAT+ tool with SRTM data, land cover and use by MapBiomas and pedology by ITCG. Results showed that higher levels of prioritization (lowest value of the environmental score - es) were most related to poorly managed vegetation, drainage structure problems and urbanization, for example headwaters 2b (es =-390), 3b (es =-330), 4a (es =-354), 5b (es =-346) and 5c (es =-322). On the other hand, when the surroundings were primarily rural activities, the environmental score were positive. With the RIAM map, municipal decision makers may allocate financial resources to points of urgency and thus avoiding the waste of time and money in locations where management was not necessarily as urgent. Also, the RIAM is an excellent diagnostic tool for urban watershed management.

J	Wingfield, T; Macdonald, N; Peters, K; Spees, J				Wingfield, Thea; Macdonald, Neil; Peters, Kimberley; Spees, Jack			Barriers to mainstream adoption of catchment-wide natural flood management: a transdisciplinary problem-framing study of delivery practice	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; WATER; POLICY; AGRICULTURE; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; SPACE; METHODOLOGY	Natural flood management (NFM) is the name given to nature-based solutions (NBS) for flood management in the UK. It is a holistic flood management technique that employs natural hydrological processes, through the installation of interventions, to slow the flow of water, creating a landscape-scale flood management system. Despite widespread interest and supporting policy from governments and non-profit organisations, NFM, as yet, has not been widely adopted as a mainstream flood management technique. A small number of academic studies examining perceived barriers to NFM adoption have identified a variety of individual factors as being responsible. It is commonly accepted that flood risk management broadly, and NFM specifically, are complex, challenges of interacting physical and human parameters, and that academic, institutional and policy divisions are rarely sympathetic to embracing these complexities. A transdisciplinary problem-framing study in conjunction with professionals experienced in the delivery of NFM projects in the UK aimed to capture these multifaceted parameters of flood management and strategic delivery at a landscape scale using group concept mapping, a systems approach to identify conceptual convergence. This policy-delivery impasse was further explored by quantifying the relative importance of individual barriers and conceptual groupings from the perspective of two different practitioner groups (flood risk managers and conservation practitioners). The results demonstrate that the NFM delivery system can be grouped into seven interacting elements, policy and regulation, politics, public perception, cross-cutting issues, funding, technical knowledge and evidence, of which each has a varying number of barriers that limit NFM uptake. Opinions differ as to the importance of these individual barriers; however, when considering the system broadly we identify that the institutional and social barriers are perceived as the most important, whilst technical knowledge and evidence are the areas of least concern. This paper aims to promote NBS flood management delivery in the UK and globally by generating, structuring and representing the multifaceted and multilevel NFM delivery system at a local level to evidence adaptive decision making at regional, national and global levels. Through problem structuring and an increased understanding and awareness of the structure and network of linking elements and perceived differences of practitioner groups that influence the system of delivery, steps can be taken towards solutions that are socially, scientifically and practically robust.

To mitigate and better adapt to compound hydrometeorological extremes, we need to better understand the state of knowledge of such extremes. Here we review the current advances in understanding compound hydrometeorological extremes: compound heat wave and drought (hot-dry), compound heat stress and extreme precipitation (hot-wet), cold-wet, cold-dry and compound flooding. We focus on the drivers of these extremes and methods used to investigate and quantify their associated risk. Overall, hot-dry compound extremes are tied to subtropical highs, blocking highs, atmospheric stagnation events, and planetary wave patterns, which are modulated by atmosphere-land feedbacks. Compared with hot-dry compound extremes, hot-wet events are less examined in the literature with most works focusing on case studies. The cold-wet compound events are commonly associated with snowfall and cold frontal systems. Although cold-dry events have been found to decrease, their underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Compound flooding encompasses storm surge and high rainfall, storm surge and sea level rise, storm surge and riverine flooding, and coastal and riverine flooding. Overall, there is a growing risk of compound flooding in the future due to changes in sea level rise, storm intensity, storm precipitation, and land-use-land-cover change. To understand processes and interactions underlying compound extremes, numerical models have been used to complement statistical modeling of the dependence between the components of compound extremes. While global climate models can simulate certain types of compound extremes, high-resolution regional models coupled with land and hydrological models are required to simulate the variability of compound extremes and to project changes in the risk of such extremes. In terms of statistical modeling of compound extremes, previous studies have used empirical approach, event coincidence analysis, multivariate distribution, the indicator approach, quantile regression and the Markov Chain method to understand the dependence, greatly advancing the state of science of compound extremes. Overall, the selection of methods depends on the type of compound extremes of interests and relevant variables.

J	Shan, XM; Yin, J; Wang, J				Shan, Xinmeng; Yin, Jie; Wang, Jun			Risk assessment of shanghai extreme flooding under the land use change scenario	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Future land use simulation; Extreme storm flooding; Risk assessment; Shanghai	SEA-LEVEL RISE; NEW-YORK-CITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL INUNDATION; URBAN-GROWTH; ADAPTATION; SIMULATION; IMPACT; FLUS; MANAGEMENT	Environmental changes have led to non-stationary flood risks in coastal cities. How to quantitatively characterize the future change trend and effectively adapt is a critical problem that needs urgent attention. To this end, this study uses the 2010 Shanghai land use data as the base and utilizes the future land use simulation (FLUS) model to simulate future land use change scenarios (2030, 2050, and 2100). Based on the results of storm and flood numerical simulations, probabilistic risk, and other multidisciplinary methods, extreme storm and flood risks of various land uses (residential, commercial and public service, industrial, transportation, agricultural, and other land) in Shanghai are analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that the future land use simulated results show that the simulation accuracy is very high, meeting the needs of our research. We evaluated future land use exposure assets and losses and found that their spatial distribution patterns are consistent, ranging from a sporadic distribution for 1/10-year to a banded distribution for 1/1000-year under the two emission scenarios. In terms of economic loss, the losses of total land use in Shanghai for 1/1000-year in 2100 are 1.8-2.7 times that of 2010 under the RCP8.5 scenario. The expected annual damage (EAD) of Shanghai's land use in 2030, 2050, and 2100 is 189.9 million CNY, 409.8 million CNY, and 743.5 million CNY under the RCP8.5 scenario, respectively, which is 1.7-3.0 times the EAD under the RCP2.6 scenario. Among them, residential, commercial and public service land as well as industrial land has the highest EAD. Risks are mainly distributed in the city center, the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, the northern shore of Hangzhou Bay, the Qingpu (QP)-Songjiang (SJ) depression in the southwest, and Chongming (CM) Island (southwest and northeast).

Comprehensive Flood Risk Assessment for Wastewater Treatment Plants under Extreme Storm Events: A Case Study for New York City, United States	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						wastewater treatment plant; storm surge; high-intensity rainfall; sea level rise; sub-basins; SLOSH; runoff model; NOAA; HAZUS-MH	RESILIENCE	Featured Application This research was designed to understand the effects of fine scale sub-basin generation technique to assess the risk of flooding for wastewater treatment plants in New York City. The article identifies the total risk of flooding from multiple sources including extreme weather events, climate change, and high intensity rainfall. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the City of New York, United States, are particularly vulnerable to frequent extreme weather events, including storm surges, high-intensity rainfall, and sea level rise, and are also affected by the cascade of these events. The complex structural configuration of WWTPs requires very fine-scale flood risk assessment, which current research has not pursued. We propose a robust technique to quantify the risk of inundations for the fourteen WWPTs through an automated sub-basin creation tool; 889 sub-basins were generated and merged with high-resolution building footprint data to create a comprehensive database for flood inundation analysis. The inundation depths and extents for the WWTPs and flood-prone regions were identified from hydrodynamic modeling of storm surge and sea level rise. The economic damage due to flooding for the WWTPs was also quantified using the HAZUS-MH model. Results indicated that the storm surges from various categories of hurricanes have the dominant impacts on flood depths around WWTPs, followed by high-intensity rainfall. Sea level rise was shown to have a relatively minor impact on flood depths. Results from economic damage analysis showed that the WWTPs are subjected to damage ranging from USD 60,000 to 720,000, depending on the size of the WWTP and the extremity of storm surge. The method of analyzing the inundation status of the research object through the sub-basin enables more accurate data to be obtained when calculating the runoff. It allows for a clearer view of the inundation status of the WWTPs when combined with the actual buildings. Using this database, predicting flood conditions of any extreme event or a cascade of extreme events can be conducted quickly and accurately.

J	Sauve, G; Van Acker, K				Sauve, Giovanna; Van Acker, Karel			Integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantitative risk assessment (QRA) to address model uncertainties: defining a landfill reference case under varying environmental and engineering conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Risk assessment; Model uncertainties; Probability; Logic tree; Landfill impacts; Landfill conditions; Climate change	MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; CLIMATE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; FRAMEWORK; LEACHATE	Purpose Model uncertainties in life cycle assessment (LCA) can arise due to the lack or limited knowledge of the system (epistemic), or due to the inherent spatial and/or temporal variability of the processes that characterize it (stochastic). Scenario analysis is often used to address such uncertainties. However, the analysis does not provide information on which scenario is more representative of the system, or more likely to occur. To account for model uncertainties in LCA, the approach presented here estimates the likelihood of occurrence of the scenarios by assigning probabilities to the events characterizing them. Method An integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantitative risk assessment (QRA) approach was developed to include the likelihood of occurrence of future events, and their consequences, in the definition of one representative scenario. The integration of the two tools was conceived at a framework level, with the inclusion of probability estimates as weighting factors for the scenario results. These probability estimates for each scenario allow improving the spatial and temporal representativeness of the model of the system. The approach was applied to a landfill case study to test its applicability in defining the impacts of a landfill reference scenario. Twelve scenarios were developed to represent the potential variation of landfill conditions over time. In particular, the degradation and failure of the containment systems, and the flooding of the site, were the main events considered in the scenario definition. An event tree was built to estimate the probability of occurrence of each scenario. Results Expected values and standard deviations were computed for all impact categories based on the impacts and their probabilities. Additional information on the probability of obtaining a certain impact was further provided by the impact curve built as function of the impacts and their cumulative probability. Conclusions Overall, the results of the study highlight the potential of the approach and the relevance of the information that the results can provide on the impact of a landfill, and more generally a system, under varying conditions over time.

Factors like degradation of green areas, trees, and vegetation are defining a new regime of urban environment giving rise to a lack of drinking water and lowering water tables. Consequently, unplanned urban sprawl with all its varied facets is having adverse impacts on the environment. Rapid variations in some of its climatic factors in the immediate vicinity are alarming and need to redress at war footings. This paper is an endeavor to present a hypothesis that urban sprawl plays a vital role in impacting and the influencing the microclimate of the city or the area. In this research, geospatial approaches were adopted to identify urban sprawl. Rise in land surface temperature (LST) for the last 25 years (from 1990 to 2016) has been highlighted using Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 TIRS) satellite images. Weather data collected from Meteorological Department is used to identify temperature rising trends. Result of the research clearly indicates that rapid urban sprawl has adverse impacts on microclimate by increasing LST. Built-up area has been changed from 178 to 477 sq. km within the years of 1990 to 2016. Vegetated area has decreased from 770 to 602 sq. km. Water areas have been decreased from 524 to 360 sq. km within the span of last 26 years. The bare land has increased from 494 sq. km to 742 sq. km. LST in winters has risen from 17 degrees C to 23 degrees C and at times shot up to 31 degrees C, which is alarming. Annual mean air temperature increased by 3 degrees C to 4 degrees C from the 1980s to 2016. During summers, the average air temperature rose to a startling 33 degrees C from 28 degrees C and LST has had a steady rise from 28.4 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The alarming urban sprawl in relation to temperature rise warrants measures which are required to plan the urban planning, forestation, and ecological measures to mitigate the disastrous trends which may result in flash floods, landslides, soil erosion and sediment transport endangering downstream reservoirs, water quality and depletion in ground water table in the valley.

The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of stream flow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.

According to the annual maximum peak flow data for the period 1956-2014 in the Manas River catchment, we used variable fuzzy set theory and the Mann-Kendall test to conduct trend and change point tests, respectively, and decomposition synthesis theory was used to handle consistency correction. Combined with the flood routing results for the Kensiwate reservoir using Monte Carlo simulation, a reservoir overtopping risk model based on right-angle trapezoidal fuzzy numbers was established, and the fuzzy risk index intervals and the corresponding fuzzy risk rate intervals for the Kensiwate reservoir were considered for past and present conditions. The results show that the local tendency and jumping of the maximum flood peak series showed significant changes; the annual runoff had an obvious growth trend in the period 1985-2006 and a gradually varying qualitative change from 1975 to 2000. In particular, the characteristic parameter reached an extreme qualitative change level of - 0.0016 in 1993. Then, we used decomposition synthesis theory to process the sequence with jumping points and obtained the past and present hydrological time series. Under the present conditions, the average flood peak sequence is 58.10% higher than in the past, and the flood design value decreases with increasing design frequency; however, when the present sequence increases, the change rates of both flood design values increase. The reservoir overtopping risk increased under the current conditions of snowmelt floods, which was affected by a significant increase in catchment temperature. Moreover, the use of right-angle trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to describe the reservoir overtopping risk was more in line with the objective reality than a traditional triangular fuzzy number. The results of this study can be used for the efficient utilization of water resources in the Manas River catchment and provide a new reference for the scientific management of reservoirs.

However, it remains unclear how they will be affected by land-use changes due to lack of knowledge and data gaps. Therefore, understanding the response mechanism of ecosystem services to land-use change is critical for developing systematic and sound land planning. In this study, we aimed to explore the impacts of land-use change on the three ecosystem services, carbon storage (CS), flood regulation (FR), and soil conservation (SC), in the ecological conservation area of Beijing, China. We first projected land-use changes from 2015 to 2030, under three scenarios, i.e., Business as Usual (BAU), Ecological Land Protection (ELP), and Rapid Economic Development (RED), by interactively integrating the Markov model (Quantitative simulation) with the GeoSOS-FLUS model (Spatial arrangement), and then quantified the three ecosystem services by using a spatially explicit InVEST model. The results showed that built-up land would have the most remarkable growth during 2015-2030 under the RED scenario (2.52% increase) at the expense of cultivated and water body, while forest land is predicted to increase by 152.38 km(2)(1.36% increase) under the ELP scenario. The ELP scenario would have the highest amount of carbon storage, flood regulation, and soil conservation, due to the strict protection policy on ecological land. The RED scenario, in which a certain amount of cultivated land, water body, and forest land is converted to built-up land, promotes soil conservation but triggers greater loss of carbon storage and flood regulation capacity. The conversion between land-use types will affect trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services, in which carbon storage would show significant positive correlation with soil conservation through the period of 2015 to 2030, under all scenarios. Together, our results provide a quantitative scientific report that policymakers and land managers can use to identify and prioritize the best practices to sustain ecosystem services, by balancing the trade-offs among services.

Six Regional Emergency Medical Operation Centers (REMOCs) are integrated and administered by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) to be responsible for emergency situations during disastrous events, such as the emission of chemical toxicants, traffic accidents, industrial materials containment, and typhoons. Objective: To analyze events reported by the six REMOCs during the 2014 to 2018 for the government policy reference. Methods: Data were collected from injured and death toll reports provided by local designated hospitals in the emergency medical reporting system. Disaster events were categorized into three categories: natural disaster (NDs), disasters associated with technology (DTs), and disasters associated with security/violence/others (DSVOs). The three categories were further subdivided into sub-categories. Variables considered for trend analyses included the number of wounded and deaths, event characteristics, date/time, and triage. The frequency of disaster events among the six REMOCs was compared using the chi-square test. We used the global information system (GIS) to describe the distribution of events in Taiwan metropolitan cities. The a-level was set at 0.05. Results: Of 580 events during the study period, the distribution of disaster characteristics in the jurisdictions of the six REMOCs were different. The majority of disaster events were DTs (64.5%), followed by NDs (24.5%) and DSVOs (11.0%). Events for the three disaster categories in the six REMOCs were different (chi(2)-test, p < 0.001). Furthermore, for the Taipei branch (Northern Taiwan), other NDs, especially heatwaves and cold spells, were most reported in New Taipei City (92.2%) and showed an increasing annual trend; for the Kaohsiung branch (Southern Taiwan), DT events were the most reported, especially in Kaohsiung City; and for the Taichung branch (Central Taiwan), DSVOs were the most reported, especially in Taichung City. Conclusion: Our data revealed that extreme weather precautions reported in the Taipei branch were increasing. Disaster characteristics were different in each metropolitan city. Upgrading the ability to respond to natural disasters is ineluctable.

Coastal flooding from wave overtopping and sea level rise adaptation in the northeastern USA	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coastal flooding; Wave-current interaction; Wave overtopping; Seawall; Coastal adaptation; Coastal resilience; Sea level rise; Climate change; ADCIRC; SWAN; Urban flooding	SHALLOW-WATER; COUPLED-WAVE; BREAKING WAVES; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; SURFACE ROUGHNESS; UNSTRUCTURED-MESH; RADIATION STRESS; HURRICANE WAVES; TIDE-SURGE; MODEL	In the northeastern United States, flooding arising from wave overtopping poses a constant threat to coastal communities during storm events. The purpose of this study is to construct a novel integrated atmosphere-ocean coast and overtopping-drainage modeling framework based on the coupled tide, surge and wave model, SWAN+ADCIRC, to assess risk and facilitate coastal adaptation and resilience to flooding in a changing climate in this region. The integrated modeling system was validated against the field observations of water level, wave height and period during the January 2015 North American blizzard. The water level collected by a sensor in the Avenues Basin behind the seawall in Scituate, Massachusetts were combined with the basin relationship between basin area and water level given by the USGS LIDAR data to obtain the field measurements of wave overtopping water volume in order to verify the model predictions. At the storm peak, the significant wave height was increased by 0.7 m at the coast by tide and surge. The wave setup along the coast varied from 0.1 m to 0.25 m depending on the coastline geometry. The interaction between tide-surge and waves increased the wave overtopping rate by five folds mainly due to the increased wave height at the toe of the seawall. The wave overtopping discharge would approximately double in an intermediate sea level rise scenario of 0.36 m by 2050 for a storm like the January 2015 North American blizzard. The wave overtopping discharge would increase by 1.5 times if the seawall crest elevation was raised by the same amount as sea level rise as an adaptation strategy. An increase of 0.9 m in the seawall crest elevation instead of 0.6 m currently planned by the town is required to bring the wave overtopping discharge to the current level under a 0.36 m sea level rise scenario. This result is primarily due to larger waves arriving at the seawall without breaking in the presence of larger water depth.

Risk assessment serves as a bridge from disaster crisis management to disaster risk management. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a refined comprehensive risk assessment of meteorological disasters in typical areas. However, several limitations remain in the disaster loss risk research, such as too coarse resolution and too single risk indicator. Additionally, less research has examined geographical information on risk clustering and barycenter migration, as well as temporal information on the sustainability of trends. Consequently, it is significant to unearth the geographical and temporal information on disaster loss and identify the refined spatial and temporal evolution pattern of crop risk. For this reason, we evaluated the risk of corn production in Gansu Province. First, based on maize yield data, a risk evaluation index system was constructed using the characteristics of variation trends, fluctuations, and extreme values of disaster losses. Then, the spatial distribution patterns and temporal evolution characteristics of maize production risks on a county scale in Gansu Province were determined using spatial analysis and climate diagnosis technology. The results show that there is a large interdecadal fluctuation in risk. In the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the average yield reduction rates of maize in Gansu Province were -11.8%, -12.6%, -8.7%, and -8.5%, and the proportions of counties with severe yield reduction were 34.8%, 44.4%, 20.8%, and 9.7%, respectively. Second, most counties belong to medium-low or low-risk areas for maize production. High-risk counties are primarily located in eastern and southern Gansu, whereas low-risk counties are mostly found along the Hexi Corridor. Third, most risk indicators exhibit some geographical aggregation. The Jiuquan region falls within the low-low-risk aggregation zone. In contrast, the Qingyang region is a high-high aggregation zone with a gradual expansion trend. Four, each risk indicator's geographical barycenter migrates over a complicated path, but the direction and distance vary considerably. The comprehensive risk migrates along the south-northwest-southeast trajectory, albeit at a shorter distance. Five, the proportion of counties with a medium, medium-severe, severe, and total yield reduction tended to decline. In addition, the annual precipitation is significantly or very significantly correlated with most risk indicators and the comprehensive risk level. The results can guide agricultural production processes at all levels, as well as government disaster prevention.

In this paper, we review the Caspian Sea level observations since the beginning of instrumental measurements (AD 1880). We summarize and discuss different aspects of the Caspian Sea levels including a) history of sea level observations with a critical appraisal of their modes of measurements and data accuracy, b) long-term, seasonal and short-term sea level changes, c) forecast of sea level, and d) impact of sea level changes. The Caspian seasonal and short-term water level changes (sub-annual) occur due to river flooding, meteorological forcing, steric changes, tsunami and tidal effects, which range from a few centimetres in a half day (i.e. the tide) up to 4 m in 5-7 days during severe storm surges. Long-term water level changes (i.e. multiyear to multidecadal) are mainly attributed to water budget; two prominent elements of which are riverine influx and evaporation from the water surface. From the mid-twentieth century, water withdrawal for human activities is also incorporated in the Caspian Sea water budget. The long-term mean water level change ranged over 3 m during instrumental observations. It rose at a rate of 15 cm y(-1) during the period of 1978-1995 and dropped at a rate of 8 cm y(-1) since 1996. During sea level rise, coastal inundation happened leading to huge economic loss; however, it improved some coastal wetland ecosystem services. Current sea level fall causes wetland reduction and desiccation. The sea level falls of the 1960s and 1970s enhanced vertical mixing; however, during both last rise and fall of the water level, the Caspian marine environment had limited vertical circulation, leading to oxygen deficiency in deep areas. Adding to anthropogenic influence, global warming through changes in precipitation, evaporation and wind regime will have significant impact on the Caspian Sea level already at the end of the current century. Despite of the importance of the local, regional and global impacts of Caspian Sea level changes, forecasts still have great uncertainty and were not successful yet.

J	Wu, YW; Yu, GY; Shao, QX				Wu, Yawen; Yu, Guangyuan; Shao, Quanxi			Resilience benefit assessment for multi-scale urban flood control programs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Resilience benefit; Urban flood; Urban flood control system; Urban flood control program; Multi-scale; Optimal configuration		Urban flood frequencies have increased and will continuously increase due to global climate change and rapid urbanization, causing enormous economic problems and social impact. Resistant strategies are no longer the best option for disaster mitigation. Improving cities' resilience to external disruptions is becoming a more important method for mitigating the impact of urban flooding. However, there are relatively little research has been conducted on the resilience of urban flood control systems. The introduction of the concept of resilience can provide a new way of thinking for urban flood control research, which can help to understand the coping process of the system during heavy rainfall, emphasizing the absorption, resistance, and recovery stages to improve the system's adaptability to the changing environment and effectively alleviate the pressure of urban flooding. This study discusses the impact of the design and configuration of urban flood control programs on the resilience of the system under heavy rainfall. Moreover, the resilience benefit is presented to quantify the phased process of system resilience capacity for measuring the quantitative relationship between programs and system resilience. Finally, the unit annual average cost of the program is combined with the resilience benefit to make decisions and ensure that cities are effectively reducing the risk of urban flooding with the optimal alternatives. The proposed framework was applied to Zhangjiagang City, a highly urbanized and densely populated city in China. The results showed that (1) during the same rainfall event, the hydrological indicators characterizing the system's resilience process (absorption, resistance, and recovery) have distinct weights; (2) rainfall has an effect on the index weight, and the weight fluctuates when the system responds to rainfall in distinct return periods; (3) rainfall return periods can have an impact on a program's effectiveness in improving the system's resilience at various stages, and the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period varies; and (4) combining large-scale and micro-scale programs improve the resilience of the system more effectively, whereas concentrating on expanding storage volume without raising the water surface rate improves the resilience of the system less effective. This framework can be used to assess the improvements in resilience acquired from various urban flood control program configurations and to assist city planners in selecting the optimal configuration, so assisting in the decision-making process for urban planning and disaster mitigation.

J	Zhang, Q; Wang, Y				Zhang, Qiang; Wang, Ying			Distribution of hazard and risk caused by agricultural drought and flood and their correlations in summer monsoon-affected areas of China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Climate warming; Summer monsoon-affected areas; Agricultural drought and flood disasters; Hazard of disaster-causing factors; Risk of loss	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; VEGETATION; REDUCTION; DISASTERS; WEATHER; EVENTS; INDEX	The summer monsoon-affected area is a suitable area for agricultural production in China. Against the background of climate warming, the activity of the summer monsoon is changing significantly. The drought and flood disasters in this region are becoming more and more frequent and have a greater and more serious impact on agricultural production. Therefore, based on observational data from meteorological stations and yield loss data in agriculture caused by drought and flood disasters in summer monsoon-affected areas, this paper studied the characteristics of the hazard of disaster-causing factors, the risk of losses to agriculture caused by droughts and floods, and their correlation. Moreover, it compared and analyzed the variability of drought and flood hazard and risk to agriculture before and after a temperature rise. The results showed that the precipitation in summer monsoon-affected areas is obviously affected by monsoon activities, and there is an overall though non-significant positive correlation between annual average standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the summer monsoon activity index (MI). The drought disaster comprehensive loss rate (DCLR) was generally higher than the flood disaster comprehensive loss rate (FCLR). This shows that the impact of drought on agriculture production is significantly greater than that of floods in this area. The high hazard and risk areas for drought were mainly distributed along the edge of the summer monsoon area and in its vicinity, whereas the high hazard and risk areas for flooding were mainly distributed in the lower reach of the Yangtze, Songhua, and Liaohe Rivers. Among them, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang are high-risk superposition areas of drought and flood disasters. The hazards of drought and flood dominate the risk of disaster loss. Climate warming has significantly expanded the high-hazard and high-risk ranges in China for drought and flood disasters and has also changed their spatial distribution patterns. The high-hazard area for drought has shifted to the monsoon edge area, the high-risk area for drought has moved northward, and both the high-hazard and the high-risk areas for floods have clearly moved southward. The impact of climate warming on drought was more significant than on floods. This study provides important scientific guidance for formulating drought and flood disaster prevention planning and agricultural production development patterns in China.

J	Peng, Y; He, GJ; Wang, GZ; Cao, HJ				Peng, Yan; He, Guojin; Wang, Guizhou; Cao, Hongjuan			Surface Water Changes in Dongting Lake from 1975 to 2019 Based on Multisource Remote-Sensing Images	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Dongting Lake; decision tree model; surface water; occurrent frequency; driving factors	INDEX NDWI; LEVEL; AREA	Dongting Lake plays an important role in water regulation and biodiversity protection, but it is vulnerable to climate change and human activities. To quantify surface water changes and factors driving them, long-term surface water variation in Dongting Lake was investigated using the multiple spectral indices method based on a decision tree classification for full time-series Landsat and MODIS datasets. Factors influencing surface water changes were explored by combining the annual maximum surface water and annual permanent occurrent water with meteorological and hydrological data. The results showed that both annual maximum surface water and annual permanent water decreased from 1975 to 2019 and the trends of rainfall and runoff at three outlets also changed. The annual maximum surface water surface of Dongting Lake increased during the 1990s due to high rainfall but decreased again after 2000. A significant change in both the hydrological stage and surface water sequence from 1986 to 2019 occurred in 2003, which coincided with the beginning of work to construct the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The surface water decreased by about 360 km(2) and runoff at the three outlets decreased by about 150 x 10(8) m(3) after the impoundment of the TGD, which was likely the main cause of surface water changes after 2003. The area of surface water that changed from permanent water in the pre-TGD period into seasonally occurring water in the post-TGD periods is 209 km(2), while the area of surface water that changed from seasonally occurring water in the pre-TGD period into permanent occurrent water in the post-TGD period is 31 km(2). Meteorological elements and human activities have had a comprehensive impact on surface water changes in Dongting Lake. Rainfall and temperature account for about one-third of the influence on long-term changes of surface water, and rainfall is the main meteorological driving factor of surface water in the wet season, while temperature is the main factor in the dry season. Runoff at three outlets, four rivers and the Chenglingji explain about half of the change in surface water; the three outlets runoff is mainly affected by human activities and is the main hydrological driving factor of surface water. The monthly maximum surface water fluctuates regularly and Dongting Lake has a strong seasonal characteristic. Indeed, the seasonal changes are significantly altered when drought or flooding occurs, the causes of which are diverse and complex.

Temporally variable crustal contributions to primitive mantle-derived Columbia River Basalt Group magmas	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Osmium; Columbia River Basalt Group; Mantle plume; Temporal changes; Climate	LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCES; HIGHLY SIDEROPHILE ELEMENT; RE-OS ISOTOPE; PICTURE GORGE BASALT; WEST GREENLAND; FLOOD BASALTS; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; CONSTRAINTS; SYSTEMATICS	The Steens Formation is one of the earliest and most primitive ( 7 wt. MgO) eruptive products of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) and the CRBG-Yellowstone-Snake River large igneous province. New major-, trace-, and highly siderophile-element abundance and 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd and 187Os/188Os data are reported for the lower and upper Steens Formation to examine likely mantle sources and the nature of magmatic differentiation and crustal contamination acting on lavas. Examined Steens Formation basalts are relatively mafic (7?9 wt% MgO), incompatible trace element enriched, and have weaker Nb and Ta anomalies compared to other CRBG lavas. The most primitive basalts have isotopic compositions at the time of crystallization consistent with originating from a mantle source that was relatively depleted (87Sr/86Sr = -0.7033; ?Ndi = - + 6.5; ?Osi = - + 1). Primary magma compositions for the Steens Formation do not provide compelling evidence for a subducted slab component, instead suggesting derivation from primitive mantle sources more similar to those of other Mesozoic continental flood basalts (CFB; e.g., Deccan, North Atlantic Igneous Province). Onset of sulfide saturation in the CRBG occured at lower MgO (<7 wt%) than in other CFB (- 8 wt%) leading to the high Os contents in the Steens Formation. Collectively, the Steens Formation exhibits decreasing Os contents, ?Ndi values and increasing 187Os/188Os with decreasing MgO. These geochemical signatures are consistent with increasing crustal contamination to parent melts with time, a feature that is also shared for the CRBG as a whole. Calculations based on Os and Nd isotopes of likely mantle and crust components to different formations of the CRBG indicates a progressive increase in the quantities of crustal contamination from -1 to 2% from Steens Formation magmatism to more than 6% during Grande Ronde and Wanapum eruptions. These results would indicate increasing crustal contamination and enhanced potential cryptic degassing of CO2 in the later, more voluminous stages of CRBG magmatism, after -16.5 Ma. Unless mantle-derived melts can produce sufficient greenhouse gas emission, there is likely an offset between the inception of the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum at 17 Ma and maximum CO2 release, indicating that CRBG eruption was a contributing factor to climate change at that time, but was not the trigger for it.

This issue is especially important over regions with complex topography, which enhances rainfall variability when associated with weather patterns. The state of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ), southeastern Brazil, is characterized by altitudes ranging from the mean sea level up to 2500 m.a.s.l, in mountain ranges and valleys covering significant parts of the region. Time series data of annual maximum daily rainfall were obtained from 110 stations with a data coverage of at least 20 years, from 1960 to 2010. The Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) normal, lognormal, exponential, gamma, Gumbel, Weibull, and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) were fitted to maximum rainfall series. Goodness-of-fit tests (Chi-squared - chi(2) and Anderson-Darling) revealed that the Gumbel, GEV, and log-normal were found to be the best choices. However,the Gumbel and GEV PDFs were the best ranking by the chi(2) and Anderson-Darling test, respectively. Extreme rainfall events with different recurrence intervals (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years) were calculated based on the Gumbel and GEV Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The differences between extreme values from Gumbell and GEV function increased as the shape parameter increases from zero, with higher probability and extreme value. Five regions with homogeneous patterns of extreme rainfall were identified using clustering analysis (Ward's method) and different recurrence intervals. Overall, the regions with higher values of extreme rainfall in all scenarios and CDFs were the ones close to the coast, within 40 km, and south of Serra dos Orgaos mountain range, located in the middle of the state. The mountain range separates the state in two halves, concentrating higher values of extreme rainfall in the lower part, where the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state's capital, is located. Scenarios for both CDF (GEV and Gumbel) indicated daily rainfall events up to 200 mm, with recurrence intervals of 50 to 100 years. In addition, the southernmost part of the state is subjected to rainfall extremes up to 260 mm in scenarios of 50 to 100 years of recurrence interval. This region, and the state's capital, are characterized by complex topography and a high fraction of population living in slums over hills, or lowlands near the ocean, increasing the vulnerability to events such as landslides and floods associated with extreme rainfall.

This is a tectonically and volcanically inactive dryland setting, comprising an eroded Plio-Pleistocene composite volcano overlying a submarine shield volcano. We mapped 228 alluvial fans, titianifing fan (F) and catchment (C) morphological properties (area [A], gradient [G], relief [R], length [L]). Fans and catchments of varying size and gradient are distributed around the island coastal margins (6%) and along interior valley sides (94%). Regression results (i.e. +ve/-ve slopes of best fit lines) conformed to broader fan research but with weak correlations, and coefficient-exponent values outside, or at the lower end of values reported from non-volcanic settings. Analysis of fan area and gradient vs catchment area regression residuals revealed fans were dominated by small-steep gradient (28%) and large-low gradient forms (39%). Fan building space is a fundamental control, specifically linked to volcano structure, but with interplay between rock strength, base level, and climate. Fans around the volcanic edifice flanks are uncommon due to steep flank slopes. Where flank margin fans occur they are typically small and steep forms due to marine erosion. Fans along flank incised valleys are common. Large low gradient fans are associated with a major volcanic riftaligned valley structure, with extensive erosion into altered and weathered edifice-core lithologies. Smallsteep gradient fans are associated with edifice flank valleys. Steeper and narrower valley forms reflect incision into stronger lithologies of the composite volcano flanks, restricting fan building space. Fans located within the volcano central depression are amongst the largest and lowest gradient types, building into the eroded and unconfined edifice core space. Coalescence, apex-toe incision, toe erosion and catchment stream channel backfilling displayed by most fans suggest landscape erosion dominates during more arid periods (e.g. interglacials), with the dryland setting generating limited sediment and insufficient flood runoff for transport and fan deposition. Fan building likely occurs during wetter periods linked to Quaternary climate variability. Quatemary eustatic variations are relevant for the volcano edifice margins where sea level changes control fan building space and erosion. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Coastal retreat, erosion, and storm surges are posing serious threats to archaeological and historical structures built along the coastal zones of this region. In order to assess the coastal changes by the end of 2100 under the expected sea level rise of about 1 m, we need a detailed determination of the current coastline position based on high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). This paper focuses on the use of very high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery for the generation of ultra-high-resolution mapping of the coastal archaeological area of Pyrgi, Italy, which is located near Rome. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of a DSM and an orthophoto with an accuracy of 1.94 cm/pixel. The integration of topographic data with two sea level rise projections in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios for this area of the Mediterranean are used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100. The effects of the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from two nearby continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations located as close as possible to the coastline are included in the analysis. Relative sea level rise projections provide values at 0.30 +/- 0.15 cm by 2050 and 0.56 +/- 0.22 cm by 2100 for the IPCC AR5 8.5 scenarios and at 0.13 +/- 0.05 cm by 2050 and 0.17 +/- 0.22 cm by 2100, for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 2.6 scenario. These values of rise correspond to a potential beach loss between 12.6% and 23.5% in 2100 for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, while, during the highest tides, the beach will be provisionally reduced by up to 46.4%. In higher sea level positions and storm surge conditions, the expected maximum wave run up for return time of 1 and 100 years is at 3.37 m and 5.76 m, respectively, which is capable to exceed the local dune system. With these sea level rise scenarios, Pyrgi with its nearby Etruscan temples and the medieval castle of Santa Severa will be exposed to high risk of marine flooding, especially during storm surges. Our scenarios show that suitable adaptation and protection strategies are required.

Agroecosystem resilience in response to extreme winter flooding	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Extreme weather; Nutrient cycling; PLFAs; Waterlogging; Flooding	SOIL COMPACTION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; WATER INFILTRATION; PLANTS; INVERTEBRATES; EARTHWORMS; PATTERNS; STRESS; GROWTH; FORMS	Evidence suggests that climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. excessive rainfall, heat, wind). The winter of 2013-14 saw exceptional levels of rainfall across the UK leading to extreme and prolonged flooding (up to 3 months with floodwater depths up to 3 m) in several low-lying agricultural areas (e.g. Somerset Levels, Thames Valley). The impact of extreme flooding and the speed of ecosystem recovery at the field-scale, however, remain poorly understood. The main objectives of this study were therefore to: (1) assess the effect of this extreme winter flooding event on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological quality indicators at 15 flood-affected sites (arable and grassland), (2) determine if these changes in soil health were reversible in the short term ( < 1 year), and (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of different mechanical interventions (sward-lifting, subsoiling, slot-seeding and aerating) to accelerate the amelioration of the damage caused by winter flooding at 2 of the 15 sites. Once the floodwater had receded (April 2014), we found that several of the measured soil quality indicators were negatively affected in the flooded areas in comparison with non flooded areas. This included a decrease in soil bulk density (by 19%), soil pH (by 0.4 units), and available P (by up to 42%). Flooding increased soil microbial biomass (60%), induced a shift in soil microbial community structure and reduced earthworm numbers. After 8 months of recovery, only soil pH remained significantly reduced (by 0.3 units) in the flooded areas in comparison to the unflooded areas. Flooding had a negative impact on the overlying vegetation at the arable sites (biomass production was reduced by between 19 and 34%) but had no major impact at the grassland sites in the long-term. In the flood amelioration experiment, the subsoiled plots produced grass with a higher nutrient content (e.g. N - up to 35%, Ca - up to 19% and Mg - up to 58%). However, the four different interventions appeared to have little positive impact on most of the soil quality indicators measured. In conclusion, extreme winter flooding was found to induce short-term alterations in key soil quality indicators and to destroy winter crops, although these effects did not persist in the longer term. Our results therefore indicate that the temperate agroecosystems evaluated here were highly resilient to winter flood stress and that recovery to a pre-flood state could be achieved within 1 year. Improved management strategies are still needed to speed up the rate of recovery after flood events to facilitate a faster return to agricultural production.

Reservoirs prevent downstream sediment transport and have become a major sediment sink. In this study, sediment deposition during the last 115 years in the Urft Reservoir in western Germany is reconstructed. The Urft Reservoir is the oldest reservoir in the Eifel Mountains and was almost completely drained in 2020. This enabled a detailed mapping of the lake bottom using an unmanned aerial system and the computation of a high-resolution digital surface model. Topographic maps with a nominal resolution of 1:1000 from the time prior to the construction of the dam (around 1900) were used to construct a pre-reservoir elevation model. A digital elevation model of difference (DoD) was calculated from these two datasets for the reservoir floor (0.72 km2). Based on the DoD, a net sediment accumulation of 1.16 x 106 m3 was calculated alongside a propagated volume error of 6.91 x 105 m3, resulting in a mean accumulation of 1.54 m. Conservative vertical error propagation results in an average level of detection (LoD) of 1.8 m. In contrast, the comparison of the DoD with 47 cores in the upper part of the reservoir showed a mean difference of -0.11 m, indicating a high, independently assessed accuracy of the DoD. Three depositional hotspots were identified in the reservoir. One is close to the Urft dam where very fine sediments are draped across the pre-reservoir topography. Two areas are related to reservoir management. Sediment deposition in the Urft Reservoir has been comparably low in comparison to other regions globally, resulting in a 3.25% +/- 1.93% loss of reservoir volume between 1905 and 2020. To analyse the effect of strong flooding events, a subset of the reservoir was analysed after an extreme event in July 2021, but accumulation did almost entirely not exceed the LoD. In this study, digital elevation models based on historical maps and present-day photogrammetric datasets were used to analyse sediment accumulation during the last 115 years in a large reservoir in central Europe. Although the spatial pattern of the sediment accumulation is quite heterogeneous, the overall sediment accumulation during this period is relatively low. This might be related to a stable vegetation cover in the catchment.image	[Stauch, Georg; Doerwald, Lukas] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Phys Geog & Geoecol, Aachen, Germany; [Esch, Alexander] Eifel Rur Water Board WVER, Duren, Germany; [Walk, Janek] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Vienna, Austria	RWTH Aachen University; University of Vienna	Stauch, G (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Phys Geog & Geoecol, Aachen, Germany.	gstauch@geo.rwth-aachen.de	Walk, Janek/Y-7342-2018; Stauch, Georg/O-2776-2013	Walk, Janek/0000-0002-3283-7214; Dorwald, Lukas/0000-0002-4022-9665; Stauch, Georg/0000-0002-8046-140X	This research was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under grant STA 1042/9-1.

Migration timing and tributary use of spawning flannelmouth sucker (<i>Catostomus latipinnis</i>)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						classification tree; Colorado River basin; environmental cues; movement; telemetry	SAN-JUAN RIVER; COLORADO RIVER; NATIVE FISHES; LIFE-HISTORY; HUMPBACK CHUB; BLUE SUCKER; MOVEMENT; HABITAT; GROWTH; DISTRIBUTIONS	Spawning phenology and associated migrations of fishes are often regulated by factors such as temperature and stream discharge, but flow regulation of mainstem rivers coupled with climate change might disrupt these cues and affect fitness. Flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) persisting in heavily modified river networks are known to spawn in tributaries that might provide better spawning habitat than neighboring mainstem rivers subject to habitat degradation (e.g., embedded sediments, altered thermal regimes, and disconnected floodplains). PIT tag data and radio telemetry were used to quantify the timing and duration of flannelmouth sucker tributary spawning migrations in relation to environmental cues in McElmo Creek, a tributary of the San Juan River in the American Southwest. We also tested the extent of the tributary migration and assessed mainstem movements prior to and after tributary migrations. Additionally, multiyear data sets of PIT detections from other tributaries in the Colorado River basin were used to quantify interannual and cross-site variation in the timing of flannelmouth sucker spawning migrations in relation to environmental cues. The arrival and residence times of fish spawning in McElmo Creek varied among years, with earlier migration and a 3-week increase in residence time in relatively wet years compared to drier years. Classification tree analysis suggested a combination of discharge- and temperature-determined arrival timing. Of fish PIT tagged in the fall, 56% tagged within 10 km of McElmo Creek spawned in the tributary the following spring, as did 60% of radio-tagged fish, with a decline in its use corresponding to increased distance of tagging location. A broader analysis of four tributaries in the Colorado River basin, including McElmo Creek, found photoperiod and temperature of tributary and mainstem rivers were the most important variables in determining migration timing, but tributary and mainstem discharge also aided in classification success. The largest tributary, the Little Colorado River, had more residential fish or fish that stayed for longer periods (median = 30 days), whereas McElmo Creek fish stayed an average of just 10 days in 2022. Our results generally suggest that higher discharge, across years or across sites, results in extended use of tributaries by flannelmouth suckers. Conservation actions that limit water extraction and maintain natural flow regimes in tributaries, while maintaining open connection with mainstem rivers, may benefit migratory species, including flannelmouth suckers.

Large-scale hydropower impacts and adaptation strategies on rural communities in the Amazonian floodplain of the Madeira River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dams; Tropical rivers; Coping strategies; Small-scale fishery; Livelihoods assets	ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; HYDROELECTRIC DAMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISHERIES; VULNERABILITY; RESETTLEMENT; BRAZIL; BASIN	Understanding social and environmental impacts and household adaptation strategies in the face of expansions in energy infrastructure projects is essential to inform mitigation and interventions programs that promote well-being. Here we conducted surveys in seven communities distributed across varying degrees of proximity to a hydropower dam complex in the Brazilian Amazon along about 250 km of the floodplain of the Madeira River. Based on interviews with 154 fishers from these communities, we examine how fishers perceived changes in fisheries yields, changes in the composition of fish species, and whether and how adaptation strategies had evolved 8-9 years after the dams' construction. Most respondents (91%) indicated declines in yields after the dams for both upstream and downstream zones. Multivariate analyses revealed statistically significant differ-ences in the composition of species yields in pre-and post-dam periods for all communities and in both upstream and downstream zones (p < 0.001). The composition of yields diversified after the dams, with an apparent decline in yields of species of greatest market value (e.g., catfishes Brachyplatystoma spp., Pseudoplatystoma spp., and jatuarana Brycon spp.), and increases in yields of a set of other smaller bodied and faster growing species (e. g., 'branquinhas' Psectrogaster spp., Potamohinna spp., and sardines Triportheus spp.). Both downstream and upstream fishers indicated that fishing profits decreased since the dams' construction (76.8% and 67.9%, respectively). To cope with these changes, the majority of both upstream and downstream fishers (>70%) stated they have had to devote more time to fishing after the dams were built. The time fishers spend traveling to fishing locations also increased for upstream communities (77.1%), but not for downstream communities. Thirty-four percent of the interviewees changed the gear they use to fish after the dams construction, with twice as many mentioning uses of non-selective gear, such as gillnets, and declining use of traditional fishing gears such as castnets and a trap ("covi"). Fish consumption overall decreased: fish was consumed 'everyday' before the dams, but 1-2 times per week or rarely after the dams were built. Although the species that declined were those of high economic value, 53% of fishers stated fish prices have increased overall after the dams. These results shed light on the potential challenges faced by fishers and which adaptation strategies they have evolved to maintain livelihoods since the construction of the dams.

Fragility of transport assets exposed to multiple hazards: State-of-the-art review toward infrastructural resilience	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Review						Fragility functions; Reliability in quantitative risk analysis; Highway and roadway infrastructure; Numerical modelling; Earthquakes; Landslides; Liquefaction; Flooding; Scouring; Multiple hazards	SOIL-STRUCTURE INTERACTION; SEISMIC RISK-ASSESSMENT; HIGHWAY BRIDGES; ROAD NETWORK; VULNERABILITY EVALUATION; PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; NATURAL HAZARDS; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Vulnerability is a fundamental component of risk and its understanding is important for characterising the reliability of infrastructure assets and systems and for mitigating risks. The vulnerability analysis of infrastructure exposed to natural hazards has become a key area of research due to the critical role that infrastructure plays for society and this topic has been the subject of significant advances from new data and insights following recent disasters. Transport systems, in particular, are highly vulnerable to natural hazards, and the physical damage of transport assets may cause significant disruption and socioeconomic impact. More importantly, infrastructure assets comprise Systems of Assets (SoA), i.e. a combination of interdependent assets exposed not to one, but to multiple hazards, depending on the environment within which these reside. Thus, it is of paramount importance for their reliability and safety to enable fragility analysis of SoA subjected to a sequence of hazards. In this context, and after understanding the absence of a relevant study, the aim of this paper is to review the recent advances on fragility assessment of critical transport infrastructure subject to diverse geotechnical and climatic hazards. The effects of these hazards on the main transport assets are summarised and common damage modes are described. Frequently in practice, individual fragility functions for each transport asset are employed as part of a quantitative risk analysis (QRA) of the infrastructure. A comprehensive review of the available fragility functions is provided for different hazards. Engineering advances in the development of numerical fragility functions for individual assets are discussed including soil-structure interaction, deterioration, and multiple hazard effects. The concept of SoA in diverse ecosystems is introduced, where infrastructure is classified based on (i) the road capacity and speed limits and (ii) the geomorphological and topographical conditions. A methodological framework for the development of numerical fragility functions of SoA under multiple hazards is proposed and demonstrated. The paper concludes by detailing the opportunities for future developments in the fragility analysis of transport SoA under multiple hazards, which is of paramount importance in decision-making processes around adaptation, mitigation, and recovery planning in respect of geotechnical and climatic hazards.

J	Sodnik, J; Mikos, M; Bezak, N				Sodnik, Jost; Mikos, Matjaz; Bezak, Nejc			Torrential Hazards' Mitigation Measures in a Typical Alpine Catchment in Slovenia	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						torrential hazards; debris flows; flash floods; extreme events; rainfall; mitigation; flexible net barriers; check dams; monitoring system	RAINFALL INTENSITY; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; DURATION CONTROL; FLOOD	Featured Application This study presents an overview of the several mitigation measures, including several check dams and flexible net barriers constructed in a typical Alpine torrential catchment in northern Slovenia (Europe) in order to protect infrastructure (i.e., ski resort cabin lift station, access road to the station, downstream settlements) against sediment-related disasters due to torrential hazards, such as flash floods and debris floods, debris flows, and shallow landslides. This newly introduced combination of technical countermeasures in Slovenia withstood the extreme floods in August 2023. Different sediment-related disasters due to torrential hazards, such as flash floods, debris flows, and landslides, can occur in an Alpine torrential catchment. When protecting infrastructure and human lives, different structural and non-structural protection measures can be used to mitigate permanent and future risks. An overview of the mitigation measures constructed near the Krvavec ski resort in northwest Slovenia (Central Europe) is presented. In May 2018, an extreme debris flood occurred in this area, causing significant economic damage. After the May 2018 event, different field investigations (i.e., geological and topographic surveys) and modeling applications (e.g., hydrological modeling, debris flow) have been conducted with the purpose of preparing the required input data for the design of protection measures against such disasters in future-due to climate change, more disasters are expected to happen in this torrential watershed. The mitigation includes the restoration of local streams, the construction of a large slit check dam for sediment retention, the construction of several smaller check dams and the construction of 16 flexible net barriers with an estimated similar to 8000 m(3) retention volume for controlling in-channel erosion in steep torrential streams. Additionally, in order to observe and monitor potential future extreme events, an extensive monitoring system has been established in the investigated area. This monitoring system will cover measurements of flexible net corrosion, the estimation of concrete abrasion at check dams, periodical geodetic surveys using small drones (UAV), hydro-meteorological measurements using rainfall gauges and water level sensors. The recent extreme floods of August 2023 also hit this part of Slovenia, and this combination of technical countermeasures withstood the event and prevented large amounts of coarse debris from being transported to the downstream section and devastating infrastructure, as was the case in May 2018 during a less extreme event. Therefore, such mitigation measures can also be used in other torrential catchments in the Alpine environment.

Modelling and quantifying extreme rainfall and its temporal changes in such environments could thus provide crucial information for design, insurance, management, ecology and climate adaptation. Rain gauge networks in the area are relatively sparse, and often characterized by missing data, which hamper the use of extreme-value methods for estimating extreme precipitation quantiles. In this study, we adopted the Simplified Metastatistical Extreme Value approach for the estimation of extreme return levels based on ordinary events (i.e., all the independent realizations of the variable of interest), which was shown to be more accurate than traditional extreme-value methods in the presence of short data records. We examined data from 66 rain gauges covering diverse hydro-climatic regions across Ghana with the aim of (i) validating the robustness of the statistical approach, (ii) characterising the climatic and altitudinal controls on the occurrence, frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes, and (iii) quantifying recent changes in the characteristics of extremes. We found that a two-parameter Weibull distribution well approximates the tail of the daily rainfall distribution throughout the area. Our statistical approach can quantify extremes with largely reduced uncertainties (7-17% uncertainty in the 100-year return levels computed using 10 years of data versus 11-62% of extreme-value based methods). Extreme precipitation statistics (daily intensity distribution, number of wet days, extreme rainfall quantiles) are found to significantly depend on latitude, so that the four latitudinally layered hydro-climatic regions typically adopted in the area well represent spatial variations. Elevation significantly affects the tail heaviness of the daily intensity distribution and thus extreme rainfall quantiles. Temporal changes during the period 1978-2018 are found to be non-homogeneous in the area as well as within the four hydro-climatic regions, but are homogeneous in three altitude-based regions. We report contrasting trends in extreme return levels in low-elevation (<200 m a.s.l.) and hilly regions, related to contrasting changes in the daily intensity distribution. Statistically significant positive trends in extreme daily rainfall amounts are observed in the inland low-elevation region of the Volta river basin, which call for further investigation of changes in future precipitation extremes in this extremely important hydrological region in SubSaharan Africa.

By raising the incised streambeds and connecting to historical floodplains, the restoration aimed to raise groundwater levels to create subsurface saturation conditions to sustain grazing forage and hay production without flood irrigation; diverted flows from the Big Wood River previously used for flood irrigation were instead routed through the restored systems. The restoration used natural channel design methods to reconstruct 5.2 km of Black Slough and 8.4 km of Crystal Creek to emulate a downstream reference reach (Willow Creek); within the relic incised channels, off-channel oxbow ponds and wetlands were created while filling other segments. Additionally, screened gravels were placed in the reconstructed channels. We monitored before-after restoration changes in channel morphology, groundwater levels, wetlands, instream flows, spawning substrates and redds, fish populations, and invertebrates for the restored creeks and reference reach over 10+ years. Following restoration, average groundwater levels increased by 0.35 m, mean annual flows at Willow Creek (receiving stream) increased from 0.64 to 1.11 m(3)/s, and average days per year that baseflows were below 0.28 m(3)/s decreased from 44.5 to 5.4 despite a decrease in average annual precipitation (16.97 to 11.53 cm). Moreover, residual pool depths increased (0.90 m), spawning substrate sizes increased (0.1 to 19.0 mm), and egg-to-fry trout survival rates increased from 90%. Six years after restoration, fish diversity increased from three to seven species, matching reference conditions. We also found dramatic increases in Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout redd counts (7 to 161 and 17 to 143, respectively) and relative abundance (0.013 to 1.166 trout/m and 0.029 to 0.222 trout/m, respectively). Invertebrate indices of restoration effectiveness were positive for both restored streams but negative for the reference reach. Overall, this study exemplifies how restoration reduced consumptive water use, created sustainable streams with hydrological connections and ponds and wetlands, and improved trout populations.

J	Semeniuk, CA; Semeniuk, V				Semeniuk, C. A.; Semeniuk, V.			Geoheritage values of consanguineous wetland suites on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Australian Earth Science Convention	JUN, 2016	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA			wetlands; geoheritage; geodiversity; consanguineous suites; Swan Coastal Plain; Western Australia	SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA; BASIN WETLANDS; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	A wide range of wetland types occur on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia. They vary from basins, and flats, to slopes and channels, and vary in size, shape, water characteristics, sediment types, stratigraphy, vegetation, origin, and maintenance processes. The wetlands range from large linear lakes to small round or irregular seasonally damp wetland basins to seasonally flooded flats, to seasonally flooded or permanently flowing channels. Salinity ranges from fresh to saline to hyposaline; and recharge mechanisms from perching of surface-water to wetting and inundation by groundwater, as determined by regional features such as geology, geomorphology, soils, climate and hydrology, and local physical/chemical processes. The Swan Coastal Plain presents a bewildering array, diversity, and complexity of wetlands, but patterns and ordering can be recognised if the wetlands are aggregated into natural groups. The wetlands, in fact, have been aggregated into natural groupings termed consanguineous suites', resulting in some 30 different formally named wetland suites related to geomorphic setting varying, for instance, from interdune depressions on a beach-ridge plain (the Becher Suite), to karst-formed linear lakes in limestone-ridge country (the Yanchep Suite), to irregular to round, semi-interconnected basins on a quartz sand subdued dune system (the Jandakot Suite), to linear and round basins formed along the hydrological contact between limestone and quartz sand (the Bibra Suite), among others. The variety of wetland types on the Swan Coastal Plain represents geodiversity that needs to be addressed in geoheritage assessments of the State of Western Australia. Further, as repositories of Holocene to Pleistocene sedimentary sequences, the wetlands present significant reservoirs of information on wetland history, climate changes, and hydrochemical history, and are templates on wetland maintenance and functioning, diagnostic for their geologic/geomorphic setting useful for management of wetlands in Western Australia, nationally, and globally. From a global perspective, the diversity and array of consanguineous suites of the Swan Coastal Plain is unique. An understated aspect of the approach in identifying consanguineous suites of wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain is that in their geological, geomorphological, and hydrological/hydrochemical setting they provide profound insights into gradual and uninterrupted wetland development, sedimentary filling and ecological functioning because, for a given east-west transect, they are located in the same climate setting but in different geologic/geomorphic and hydrochemical settings. They appear to be unrepresented globally, and therefore, in terms of geoheritage, are internationally significant.	[Semeniuk, C.

J	Wu, JF; Chen, XH				Wu, Jiefeng; Chen, Xiaohong			Spatiotemporal trends of dryness/wetness duration and severity: The respective contribution of precipitation and temperature	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Dryness/wetness; Duration and severity; Precipitation; Temperature; Contribution; Pearl River basin (PRB)	PEARL RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT; SEA-LEVEL; CHINA; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; EXTREMES; PROJECTIONS	This study explores the respective contributions of precipitation and temperature variability to the trends of the duration and severity of the dryness/wetness, and takes the Pearl River basin (PRB) in the southern China as a study example. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPED, which uses the monthly precipitation and temperature as input variables, was calculated based on the monthly precipitation and temperature records of 42 meteorological gauges during 1960-2015 in the PRB. The run theory was then applied to extract the dryness/wetness characteristics including the drought duration and severity and the wetting duration and severity. In addition, a simple algorithm for quantifying the respective contribution of the precipitation and temperature variability to the dryness/wetness trends was proposed; the algorithm determines the changes in the slopes magnitude (linear regression) for the dryness/wetness characteristics that were identified from different SPEI scenarios (i.e. the precipitation and temperature groups of observed, one of them detrended, and both detrended) using the run theory method. Our results showed that the increasing trends of drought duration and severity were more apparent in the northwestern areas with high elevation (> 1000 m) than the southeastern areas with low elevation (< 500 m), whereas the change trends of the wetness duration and severity exhibited opposite results. The variability of the precipitation and temperature played different roles in the trends of the dryness/wetness characteristics; the effects of the temperature changes on these trends were larger than the effects of the precipitation changes, i.e., an increase in the temperature clearly affected the change trends of duration and severity for the dryness/wetness. In the PRB, a slight increase in the average precipitation resulted in decreases in the trends of drought duration and severity of 9.89% and 19.63% respectively and increases in the trends of wetting duration and severity of 1.59% and 11.52%. However, a marked increase in the average temperature resulted in increases in the trends of drought duration, drought severity, wetting duration, and wetting severity of 48.38%, 55.16%, 46.21%, and 34.40%, respectively. Thus, in light of global warming, the government should focus more attention on the evolution of the dryness/wetness characteristics because increases in severe drought occurrences and flood severities and secondary disasters may result in more severe losses.

J	Navarro, G; Molina, JA				Navarro, Gonzalo; Antonio Molina, Jose			A floristic-ecological classification of the shrublands of the dry Bolivian Altiplano	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA			English	Article						Andean region; diagnostic species; Fabiana densa; Lampayo castellani; Lobivio ferocis-Fabianion densae; numerical classification; orotropical climate; Parastrephia lepidophylla; Parastrephion lepidophylkte; plant-community type; shrubland	VEGETATION; CLIMATE	Aims: To identify shrubland types of the Bolivian Altiplano based on their floristic composition and on ecological factors. Location: Central and southern Bolivian Altiplano (Bolivia, central-western South America). Methods: Vascular plants were recorded in a field survey of 101 releves (10 m(2)). Releves were subjected to hierarchical agglomerative classification to define numerical vegetation groups. Classification techniques were based on the beta-flexible linkage method (beta = -0.25) with Sorensen distance. The highest crispness values defined the level of the main number of clusters identified. Diagnostic species were identified by means of the phi coefficient of fidelity. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test and a Z test were performed to assess the key ecological drivers of diversity in the Altiplano shrubland vegetation. Results: Based on numerical analyses of phytosociological releves, our work proposes four vegetation types of shrublands in the dry central and southern Bolivian Altiplano. They correspond to the following: tolillares - thickets of Fabiana densa - of the central-southern Altiplano with Junellia seriphioides; tolillares of the central-northern Altiplano with Lobivia pentlandii; lampayares - thickets of Lampayo castellani - with Parastrephia quadrangularis; and tolares - thickets of Parastrephia sp. pl . - with Parastrephia lepidophylla and Junellia minima. The bioclimatic variables were the ones best explaining the distribution patterns of the shrubland vegetation in the dry Bolivian Altiplano. Specifically, they separate the tolillares of the central-northern Altiplano with Lobivia pentlandii - at localities with a higher annual precipitation, annual ombrothermic index, and ombrothermic index of the wettest quarter - from the tolillares of the central-southern Altiplano with Junellia seriphioides. These bioclimatic gradients also position lampayares at localities with a lower than average value of annual precipitation, annual ombrothermic index, and ombrothermic index of the wettest quarter. Significant differences were found when comparing the topographic position, the degree of soil drainage and the frequency of flooding between the vegetation of tolillares on the one hand, and the vegetation of lampayares and tolares, on the other. Lampayares were exclusively related to sandy soils. Conclusions: Our four groups characterize variation within the habitat and elucidate bioclimatic gradients and soil features with related habitats. This knowledge could provide basic information on the vulnerability of different Altiplano shrubland habitats to climatic fluctuations, as this area is highly vulnerable to extreme periods of drought associated with the regional effects of climate change as well as to anthropogenic factors.

J	Habibi, H; Awal, R; Fares, A; Temimi, M				Habibi, Hamideh; Awal, Ripendra; Fares, Ali; Temimi, Marouane			Performance of Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) product in monitoring precipitation under extreme events in Harris County, Texas	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS); Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE); Flood Warning System (FWS); Extreme rainfall events	TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; HURRICANE HARVEY; RAINFALL; MODEL; PREDICTION; IMPACT; SENSITIVITY; CALIBRATION; NETWORK	With an increase in intensity and frequency of extreme precipitations as a result of climate change, it is necessary to develop effective strategies for emergency flood management plan. It is critical to integrate the use of high-resolution hydro-meteorological data (e.g., precipitation) as input for hydrologic modeling to accurately predict and reduce the negative impact of floods. The Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system has been developed by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) to produce high-resolution spatio-temporal precipitation data. While the MRMS data are available at relatively high spatial (1 km) and temporal (2 min) resolutions across the continental United States (CONUS), MRMS's accuracy in measuring actual precipitation needs to be investigated across some urban areas such as Harris County, TX. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate i) the performance of the MRMS system compared to other precipitation products (rain gauge network, Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE)) at different spatial (5, 10, 15, 30 km) and temporal aggregations (5, 10,15, 30, 60 min) during four major flooding events of May 2015 (Memorial Day flood), April 2016 (Tax Day Flood), August 2017 (Hurricane Harvey), and September 2019 (Tropical Storm Imelda) in Harris County, Texas; and ii) the effects of temporal and spatial aggregation scales on the performance of the MRMS system using a suite of statistical parameters. Point-to-grid comparisons were conducted between 142 rain gauges and MRMS system data during four extreme flood events. Overall, the MRMS system captured precipitation reasonably well with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.78, correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.21 mm, critical success index (CSI) of 0.65, probability of detection (POD) of 0.98, and false alarm ratio (FAR) of 0.34 over Harris County at 15 min and 15 km temporal and spatial resolutions. The results indicate that MRMS product tends to underestimate higher precipitation rates and overestimate light precipitation. Coarser temporal resolutions from 5 min to 1 h resolved some of the overestimation issues. Temporal aggregation increased R-2, CC, CSI, and error variances and decreased FAR. However, increasing spatial resolution from 1 to 30 km increased R-2, CC, and CSI and reduced RMSE and FAR. A comparison of MPE QPE and MRMS products at hourly temporal resolution with gauge observations showed that both products estimate rainfall accurately for the four events. Still, on average, MRMS product has a slightly better agreement with rain gauge observations at 1-hr temporal resolution.

The moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by 7% with a temperature increase of 1 degrees C. A higher moisture content results in frequent and violent rainfall events, and the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall and flooding events in certain countries and regions is gradually aggravated. Simulated extreme precipitation experiments with precipitation intensities of 50, 100, and 200 mm and precipitation time on 3th, 6 th, and 9 th day were set to study the effects of extreme precipitation and flooding events on the degradation performance of open algae-bacteria symbiotic (ABS) system for anaerobic digestion effluent (ADE). The experimental results showed that the precipitation time had an obvious impact on the open algae-bacteria symbiotic system. The daily COD (chemical oxygen demand) degradation rates in the algae-bacteria symbiotic system on the fourth day decreased from 12.64% (unaffected by precipitation) to 2.94, 2.38, and 1.90%, respectively, under the conditions of rainfall on the third day and precipitation intensities of 50, 100, and 200 mm. At the end of the experiments, the COD contents in the ADE increased from 355.09 mg/L (unaffected by precipitation) to 435.77, 413.67, and 403.54 mg/L, respectively. The degradation effects of COD, TN (total nitrogen), and TP (total phosphorus) in the open algae-bacteria symbiotic system were affected by extreme precipitation (200 mm) and flooding. On the third day of the heavy rainfall event, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla in the samples of the symbiotic system between algae and bacteria. Among them, the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was the highest, accounting for 15.33, 21.33 and 19.97%, respectively. As the symbiotic system operated stably, their proportions decreased to 13.58, 12.13, and 17.85% on the ninth day. At the class level, the abundance of Beta-proteobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria was relatively high in the samples of the symbiotic system.

Because many projected changes due both to climate and human actions stand to increase sediment supplied to world rivers, it is imperative that our understanding of river response to influxes of sediment be comprehensive, underpinned by sound theory and augmented by empirical observations. To that end, here we review the literature concerning the geomorphic response of low-gradient, braided and meandering alluvial river channels to increases in sediment supply. We define such rivers as those with a gradient <0.002 that flow within a self-formed floodplain and are semi-confined or unconfined in terms of capacity for lateral adjustment. The intent of this review is both to provide managers, practitioners, and scientists with a readily referenceable summary of changes observed in a multitude of settings and to create an empirically supported conceptual framework that can be used in concert with existing models to contextualize and anticipate geomorphic response to a sediment influx. Upon analysis, several ideas emerge from the literature. First, channel adjustment following a sediment supply increase occurs across a series of nested response scales, which are separated by thresholds defined by aspects of the sediment influx. Second, the crossing of these thresholds is primarily a function of the influx grain size distribution and volume relative to the antecedent bed grain size and sediment load. Third, we term these thresholds, which represent the sediment input parameters necessary to drive change to occur at successively larger scales, influx effectiveness thresholds. Last, future work must focus on further quantification of these thresholds by explicit measurement of various metrics, including influx vol-umes and characteristics and antecedent sediment loads and parameters, and examination of additional con-trolling factors such as system trajectory and biotic influences. The synthesis and framework presented here should ideally assist in enhanced understanding and improved prediction of geomorphic adjustment following a sediment supply increase as well as steer future studies towards thorough investigations of the various dynamics necessary to further increase our knowledge of channel response(s) to changing sediment inputs.

J	Cheng, JQ; Yin, SY				Cheng, Junqi; Yin, Shuyan			Evaluation of Population-Food Relationship from the Perspective of Climate Productivity Potential: A Case Study of Eastern Gansu in Northwest China	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						cultivated land; population carrying capacity; climate production potential	IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; MAIZE	Suffering from the double blow of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and floods, food security issues have once again become a source of concern. Eastern Gansu is an important dry farming area in northwestern China, and agricultural production has been greatly affected by climate change. Based on the climate data of 17 national meteorological stations in eastern Gansu from 1961 to 2020 and the data on population, grain planting area and grain production in each region from 1986 to 2019, using the Thornthwaite Memorial model, this paper analyzed the climate production potential (T-SPV), population carrying capacity and population carrying capacity index in eastern Gansu, and then revealed the relationship between population and food in eastern Gansu. The findings and results revealed that: (1) over the past 60 years, the temperature in eastern Gansu has been increasing and precipitation has been decreasing; (2) T-SPV has been increasing. Moreoever, the spatial distribution was significantly different, showing a trend of decreasing from the southeast to the northwest. Lintao, Huining, and Jingtai displayed a decreasing trend, while other areas exhibited an increasing trend. Precipitation was the main limiting factor for T-SPV; (3) Grain production continued to increase due to changing hydrothermal conditions and improved production efficiency. Cultivated land-population carrying capacity and climate production potential-population carrying capacity (T-SPV-population carrying capacity) both exhibited a significant increasing trend (p < 0.01). Cultivated land-population capacity increased from southeast to northwest, and all stations expressed an increasing trend. T-SPV-population carrying capacity increased from southeast to northwest, and the whole region displayed an increasing trend. Even in extremely reduced production years, T-SPV-population carrying capacity was also greater than cultivated land-population carrying capacity. This revealed that, under ideal conditions, T-SPV-population carrying capacity can fully meet the needs of the current population. (4) The population carrying capacity index showed a significant downward trend (p < 0.01). It showed a trend of decreasing from south to north, and whole area underwent a decreasing trend consistently, indicating that the population-food relationship in eastern Gansu tended to be balanced. This result was conducive to correct assessment of the relationship between people and food in the study area, and provided a reference for formulating food policies.

Understanding the contribution of different agricultural practices to supply ESs would help inform choices about the most beneficial land use management. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g., climate change, food and water security, or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits. Some actions farmers can implement in the new Rural Development Programs (RDP 2021-2022 and 2023-2027) can be considered as NbS and could affect the quantity, quality, and time of some ESs related to water regulation and supply, N adsorption and erosion protection. This study aims to evaluate these ESs in different scenarios in the upper Foglia river basin (Italy) and at a local scale (farming), and to highlight the issue to compensate farmers for the production of public goods which benefit the whole society (ESs) by the implementation of RDP's actions. These scenarios highlight how actions have positive effects on ecosystem services and their economic value related to land use management, on maintaining agricultural practices by integrating Water Frame Directive (2000/60/EC), Directive 2007/60/EC on the management of flood risks and highlighting the potential role of farmers in a high diversity landscape. This study highlights a new way to evaluate the processes of natural capital in the production of public goods, which benefits the whole society (ESs), by emphasizing the economic and environmental role of farmers in producing them and putting on the table data to trigger a PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) mechanism. To facilitate decision making, robust decision support tools are needed, underpinned by comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and spatially modeling in which agriculture can be a strategic sector to optimize food production and environmental protection in harmony with the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy.

Extreme Runoff of Chemical Species of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Threatens a Florida Barrier Island Lagoon	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Indian River Lagoon; nitrogen; phosphorus; dissolved organic nitrogen; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; Aureoumbra lagunensis	INDIAN RIVER LAGOON; DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN; TEXAS BROWN TIDE; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; AUREOUMBRA-LAGUNENSIS; WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; NUTRIENT; CARBON; STORM	Extreme runoff of stormwater to poorly flushed barrier island lagoons often adds excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that can promote subsequent, sometimes intense, harmful algal blooms (HABs). Successful management of such estuaries requires special appreciation of when and how to control concentrations and fluxes of chemical species of N and P during high flow. Toward that end, monthly surveys and episodic rain-event sampling were carried out from December 2015 to March 2018 for two contrasting tributaries of the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), a barrier island lagoon in Florida. One tributary, South Prong Saint Sebastian River, flows through predominantly agricultural, forested and open land, whereas the second tributary, Crane Creek, traverses mainly residential-commercial land. Concentrations of some N and P species in these tributaries increased with increased flow and could be described with statistically significant equations for concentration versus flow rate, thereby supporting flow-rate-dependent flux determinations. Drainage basin yields (fluxes per square km) varied with land cover/use. Calculated annual yields of dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved inorganic P (DIP) averaged similar to 70% greater for South Prong Saint Sebastian River from high flow through thicker, more organic- and P-rich soils. In contrast, yields of nitrate + nitrite were 100% higher for Crane Creek from widespread application of N-fertilizer to thin layers of turfgrass overlying sand, plus runoff of N-rich reclaimed water. Two major weather events highlighted our study and foreshadow impacts from climate change. Seven months of drought from November 2016 to May 2017 were followed in September-October 2017 by excess rain, runoff and flooding from Hurricane Irma. Consequently, >50% of freshwater fluxes and similar to 60% of N and P fluxes from South Prong Saint Sebastian River, Crane Creek and other IRL tributaries occurred during 2 months in 2017. Lagoon-wide inputs provided enough bioavailable N and P to help support a nanoeukaryotic bloom for >5 months, with chlorophyll a values >50 mu g L-1. The bloom was co-dominated by the brown tide alga, Aureoumbra lagunensis, and an unidentified nanoeukaryotic green alga. Decreased salinity, low concentrations of dissolved inorganic N and P, and decreasing dissolved organic P (DOP), combined with biological factors, diminished the IRL bloom by mid-2018.</p>	[Trefry, John H.; Fox, Austin L.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn & Marine Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA	Florida Institute of Technology	Trefry, JH (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn & Marine Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.	jtrefry@fit.edu		Fox, Austin/0000-0003-0684-0425	Florida Legislature as part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Grant [NS005]; Open Access Subvention Fund; John H.

Many AISs, however have now been degraded. A systematic analysis of AISs on their typologies, causes of degradation, and their ecosystem services is lacking.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to synthesize the knowledge on AISs on their typologies, status and causes of degradation, ecosystem services and functions, and identify gaps in research in Asia and Africa.METHOD: A critical review of peer-reviewed journal papers, conference and workshop proceedings, book chapters, grey literature, and country reports was conducted. Qualitative and quantitative information from journal papers were used to conceptualize the typologies and analyze the status and causes of degradation, and ecosystems services and functions provided by the AISs.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Based on the review, we classified AISs into three groups by source of irrigation water: Rainwater harvesting system (RHS) with small reservoirs, ground water based system, and floodwater based system. The RHSs, which used to receive reliable rainfall and managed by well cohesive social organi-zations for their maintenance and functioning in past, have now been silting due to extreme rainfall pattern and breakdown of the cohesive organizations in recent decades. In ground water based systems, indiscriminate development of deep tube wells causing siltation of channels has been a major challenge. In floodwater irrigation systems, irregular rainfall in the highlands and the breakage of irrigation structures by destructive floods were the main causes of degradation. Lack of maintenance and increased soil erosion, inadequate skilled manpower, and declining support from the government for repair and maintenance were the main causes of degradation of all AISs.The main ecosystem service provided by all AISs is water for agriculture. In tank-and pond-based systems, fish farming is also practiced. Tank irrigation systems provide various types of provisioning, regulatory, cultural and supporting services, especially in India and Sri Lanka. Ground water based systems provide water for domestic purposes and various cultural services. Floodwater based systems provide water for power generation and wildlife habitat maintenance and help in flood control.SIGNIFICANCE: The knowledge generated through the review provide evidence-based information, and help aware governments, private sectors and development agencies for improved policy planning and decision making, and prioritizing the restoration, rehabilitation, and management of various AISs.

Against the backdrop of climate change, in most cities in Jiangsu Province of China, significant trends of increasing intensities of heavy rainfall are apparent. The parameters of the rainstorm intensity formula are no longer applicable in the current context of significantly stronger rainstorms. To adapt to this change, we first contrasted the fitting accuracy of the Gumbel distribution, the exponential distribution, and the Pearson III distribution for the rainstorm intensity formula in Jiangsu. It was found that the Gumbel distribution has the smallest relative mean square error in most cities, proving that it provides the best estimation of rainstorm intensity formula parameters. Therefore, the rainstorm intensity formula parameters for 13 cities was revised using the Gumbel distribution based on the rainfall data from 1991 to 2020. Then, the precipitation with a 100-year return period was calculated using the revised formula. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of storm hyetographs that have been designed for Jiangsu, we designed short-duration rainstorm hyetographs for 13 cities using the Chicago hyetograph method and the Pilgrim and Cordery (PC) method. The results show that most of the short-duration rainstorms lasted between 45 and 120 min and were dominated by single-peaked patterns, with the peak position typically occurring in the first half of the rainfall cycle. The peak coefficient distribution of short-duration rainstorms shows that short-duration rainstorms in the south reached their peak rainfall intensity earlier than those in the north. On this basis, using the Chicago method and PC method, short-duration storm hyetographs were designed, which could be used in the design of drainage systems to provide support in effectively reducing urban flood threats. By comparing the hyetographs with real short-duration rainstorm patterns, it was found that the precipitation process designed using the PC method was most similar to the actual precipitation process. However, the PC method was found to be highly dependent on local precipitation data, whereas only the rain peak coefficient is required to design the Chicago rainstorm hyetograph. Therefore, we primarily recommend hyetographs designed using the PC method for Jiangsu Province's 13 major cities, while we recommend the Chicago hyetograph for the surrounding areas of the 13 cities that have no meteorological stations or lack data.

However, due to the limitation of instruments and the disturbance induced by wave motions superimposed on water levels, it was difficult to detect the high-frequency oscillation of the submerged beach bed level. In this study, an observation, lasting for 12 days and covering the middle tide to the following spring tide, was conducted on a meso-macro tidal beach, Yintan Beach, to simultaneously detect the characteristics and influence mechanism of bed level changes at intra-tidal and tidal cycle scales. The collected data included water depth, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), waves, high-frequency three-dimensional (3-D) velocity, and the distance of the seabed to the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) probe, which were measured by an optical backscatter sensor, two Tide & Wave Recorder-2050s, and an ADV, respectively. The results showed that the tidal cycle-averaged bed level decreased by 58.8 mm, increased by 12.6 mm, and increased by 28.9 mm during neap, middle, and spring tides in succession, respectively, compared with the preceding tidal regimes. The net erosion mainly resulted from large incident wave heights and the consequent strong offshore-directed sediment transport induced by undertows. Moreover, the variations in the bed level were more prominent during a neap to middle tides than during middle to spring tides, which were jointly caused by the wave-breaking probability regulated by water depth and the relative residence times of shoaling wave, breaker, and surf zones that were determined by relative tidal range. In terms of the intra-tidal bed level, it displayed an intra-tidal tendency of increase during floods and decrease during ebb tides, i.e., the intra-tidal bed level changes were controlled by water depth, which modulated the effects of waves on sediment resuspension and vertical sediment exchange. To be specific, waves and SSC were responsible for the intra-tidal bed level changes under low-energy wave conditions, while mean current and bedform exerted important influences on the variations of the intra-tidal bed level under moderate wave conditions, which broke the foregoing interrelation between bed level, waves, and SSC. This study, therefore, emphasizes the usage of ADV measurement to investigate bed level changes in sandy coasts.

Thus, filling in rainfall gaps becomes necessary to complete databases. This article proposes the use of satellite products (TRMM-Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, CHIRPS-Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations and CMORPH-CPC Morphing Technique) to fill gaps in the rainfall historical series. The simple regression method, using satellite rainfall estimates, was tested to fill the missing data from 164 rainfall gauge stations in the Amazon region. Large dispersions were observed between rainfall data, with R-2 ranging from 0.383 to 0.844, the best results were found in areas with less rainfall. As well, the greatest performance of the products was verified in the dry period, with r and d higher than 0.899 and 0.950, respectively. The product with the best representation in the region was CHIRPS, which had the lowest monthly values of mean absolute error (0.979 mm) and root mean square error (3.656 mm). The results confirm that the satellite estimates satisfactorily represent the seasonal variation of rainfall in the region, despite presenting cases of overestimation and underestimation of data. The higher performance of CHIRPS can be explained by the higher spatial resolution (0.05 degrees), allowing for more accurate weather forecasts. In fact, CHIRPS has the CHPclim model, which adds other factors to the good product performance. These characteristics justify the better performance of the CHIRPS product for filling gaps in daily rainfall data in the Amazon region, favoring the best monthly rainfall estimates for each region state analyzed. Recommendations for Resource Managers Satellite products have been increasingly used for estimating rainfall data in regions with a low number of installed rainfall gauge stations. Thus, the assessment and selection of these products needs to be elaborated for the best decision making of water resource managers. Rainfall data are important to recognize the occurrence patterns for prediction of the climatic behavior of a region. Sectors such as agriculture and disaster prevention (droughts, floods, erosion of watersheds, and river silting) need knowledge of rainfall for planning, management, and mitigation. Knowledge of rainfall behavior is very important in the Amazon region. In this case, the dry season and temperatures have been increasing due to global climate change. These changes establish conditions for more intense fires, which increases the deforestation of the region.

Recent research regarding the Ca2+ sensor CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN 10 (CBL10) has resulted in important advances in understanding the function of this signaling component during abiotic stress tolerance. Under saline conditions, CBL10 function was initially understood to be linked to regulation of Na+ homeostasis, protecting plant shoots from salt stress. During this process, CBL10 interacts with the CBL-interacting protein kinase 24 (CIPK24, SOS2), this interaction being localized at both the plasma and vacuolar (tonoplast) membranes. Interestingly, recent studies have exposed that CBL10 is a regulator not only of Na+ homeostasis but also of Ca2+ under salt stress, regulating Ca2+ fluxes in vacuoles, and also at the plasma membrane. This review summarizes new research regarding functions of CBL10 in plant stress tolerance, predominantly salt stress, as this is the most commonly studied abiotic stress associated with the function of this regulator. Special focus has been placed on some aspects that are still unclear. We also pay particular attention on the proven versatility of CBL10 to activate (in a CIPK-dependent manner) or repress (by direct interaction) downstream targets, in different subcellular locations. These in turn appear to be the link through which CBL10 could be a key master regulator of stress signaling in plants and also a crucial participant in fruit development and quality, as disruption of CBL10 results in inadequate Ca2+ partitioning in plants and fruit. New emerging roles associated with other abiotic stresses in addition to salt stress, such as drought, flooding, and K+ deficiency, are also addressed in this review. Finally, we provide an outline of recent advances in identification of potential targets of CBL10, as CBL10/CIPKs complexes and as CBL10 direct interactions. The aim is to showcase new research regarding this master regulator of abiotic stress tolerance that may be essential to the maintenance of crop productivity under abiotic stress. This is particularly pertinent when considering the scenario of a projected increase in extreme environmental conditions due to climate change.

An analysis of the relationship between protected areas and the economic growth of Brazilian Amazon municipalities	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Conservation policy; Tropical rainforest; Strictly-protected areas; Multiple-use protected areas; Indigenous lands; Local development	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION; POVERTY; BIODIVERSITY; EDUCATION; IMPACT; DEGAZETTEMENT	The Brazilian Amazon harbours 70 % of the world's tropical forests and is essential to the country's economy because it maintains biodiversity, sustains the livelihoods of the indigenous people and local communities, and provides ecosystem services such as water production, soil stabilization, flood prevention, and climate regulation. In the last three decades, the Brazilian government has established a regional protected area (PA) network that currently covers approximately 48 % of the region. Despite their importance, some sectors of the Brazilian society have argued that the expansion of the PM across the region hampers the local economic development, because they make less area available for non-forest economic activities such as large-scale agriculture, mining, and power generation. In this study, we analysed the relationship between local economic growth and PA coverage in 516 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004 to 2014. We modelled the impact of the coverage of the three types of PM (strictly-protected, multiple-use, and indigenous lands) on the (i) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the real gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita), and (ii) real gross value added per capita (GVA per capita) of the agriculture, industry, services, and government sectors in each municipality. The models also considered the following control variables at the municipal level: area, age, per capita GPD in 2004 (or per capita GVAs in 2004), population growth rate between 2004 and 2014, education index, deforested area outside PA per capita, deforested area inside PA per capita, degraded area outside PA per capita, degraded area inside PA per capita, and presence of illegal mining within PA. We applied spatial Durbin error models (SDEM) to analyse the direct, indirect, and total impacts of the PM on the local economic growth. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between the local economic growth and PA coverage in any of the three PA groups evaluated. Only the total impact of the GVA per capita of the industry was negatively correlated with the coverage of the strictly-protected PM. Our findings do not support the arguments used by some interest groups of the Brazilian society that the social and environmental gains generated through the expansion of PM across the region constrain the overall local economic growth.

J	Kang, DH; Nam, DH; Song, YS; Kim, BS				Kang, Dong Ho; Nam, Dong Ho; Song, Young Seok; Kim, Byung Sik			A Proposed Method for Calculating the Rainfall Threshold Based on the Multi-Method to Provide Heavy Rain Disaster Impact Information	WATER			English	Article						impact forecast; threshold rainfall; multi-method; G2G (grid to grid)	MODEL	Recently, Korea has been affected by various disasters caused by climate change and the resulting changes in weather, which have been taking an increasing toll on the country. A review of weather phenomena and their socioeconomic impact identified weather disasters as one of the most damaging categories of disasters. As such, this study suggests a method for calculating the rainfall threshold to predict the impact of heavy rain. In order to calculate the rainfall threshold based on the multi-method, the entire territory of South Korea was divided into 1 km by 1 km grids, and a method for calculating the rainfall threshold was proposed by grouping them into four categories: standard watershed, urban areas, rivers, and inundation traces. This study attempted to verify the results of the rainfall threshold in standard watersheds and urban areas. The results were verified using the data from events during the heavy rain in Seoul in 2022 and 2018, the heavy rain in Busan in 2020, and Typhoon Mitag in October 2019. As a result of the verification and calculation, a rainfall threshold was found on the grid where the actual flooding damage occurred in Busan, where heavy rain caused a large amount of urban flooding in July 2020. The application of the rainfall threshold on the grid caused enough damage to flood vehicles. After this application, it was found that flooding of more than 0.2 m affected vehicles. During early September in the Gangneung grid, flooding damage was caused by Typhoon Haishen, which affected traffic. In this damaged grid, it was also found that flooding of more than 0.2 m occurred according to the rainfall impact limit. In this study, since there were no quantitative data, verification was performed using qualitative data such as news and SNS. Therefore, quantitative verification methods using flooding sensors and CCTVs need to be carried out in the future. After verification using qualitative data, we found that the time when the actual flooding damage occurred and the flooding patterns were well ascertained. The rainfall threshold calculation method and the rainfall prediction information developed in this study are expected to be applicable to impact forecasting, which can provide people affected by heavy rainfall with information on how the rainfall will affect them, as well as simple rainfall forecasts.

This study focuses on the forecasting of drought using selected Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based models to enable decision-makers to improve regional water management plans and disaster mitigation/reduction plans. Four ANN models were developed in this study, viz., one conventional ANN model and three hybrid ANN models: (a) Wavelet based-ANN (WANN), (b) Bootstrap based-ANN (BANN), and (c) Wavelet-Bootstrap based-ANN (WBANN). The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the best drought index identified for the study area, was used as a variable for drought forecasting. Three drought indices, such as SPEI-3, SPEI-6 and SPEI-12 respectively representing "short-term", "intermediate-term", and "long-term" drought conditions, were forecasted for 1-month to 3-month lead times for six weather stations over the study area. Both statistical and graphical indicators were considered to assess the performance of the developed models. For the hybrid wavelet model, the performance was evaluated for different vanishing moments of Daubechies wavelets and decomposition levels. The best-performing bootstrap-based model was further used for analysing the uncertainty associated with different drought forecasts. Among the models developed for drought forecasting for 1 to 3 months, the performances of the WANN and WBANN models are superior to the simple ANN and BANN models for the SPEI-3, SPEI-6, and SPEI-12 up to the 3-month lead time. The performance of the WANN and WBANN models is the best for SPEI-12 (MAE = 0.091-0.347, NSE = 0.873-0.982) followed by SPEI-6 (MAE = 0.258-0.593; NSE = 0.487-0.848) and SPEI-3 (MAE = 0.332-0.787, NSE = 0.196-0.825) for all the stations up to 3-month lead time. This finding is supported by the WBANN analyze uncertainties as narrower band width for SPEI-12 (0.240-0.898) as compared to SPEI-6 (0.402-1.62) and SPEI-3 (0.474-2.304). Therefore, the WBANN model is recommended for the early warning of drought events as it facilitates the uncertainty analysis of drought forecasting results.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor, the GRACE Follow-On (GFO), have furnished comprehensive monthly TWS data since April 2002. However, there are 35 months of missing data over the entire GRACE/GFO observational period. To address this gap, we developed an operational approach utilizing singular spectrum analysis and principal component analysis (SSA-PCA) to fill these missing data over mainland China. The algorithm was demonstrated with good performance in the Southwestern River Basin (SWB, correlation coefficient, CC: 0.71, RMSE: 6.27 cm), Yangtze River Basin (YTB, CC: 0.67, RMSE: 3.52 cm), and Songhua River Basin (SRB, CC: 0.66, RMSE: 7.63 cm). Leveraging two decades of continuous time-variable gravity data, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations in TWS across ten major Chinese basins. According to the results of GRACE/GFO, mainland China experienced an average annual TWS decline of 0.32 +/- 0.06 cm, with the groundwater storage (GWS) decreasing by 0.54 +/- 0.10 cm/yr. The most significant GWS depletion occurred in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) at -2.07 +/- 0.10 cm/yr, significantly substantial (similar to 1 cm/yr) depletions occurred in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), SRB, Huaihe River Basin (HHB), Liao-Luan River Basin (LRB), and Southwest River Basin (SWB), and moderate losses were recorded in the Northwest Basin (NWB, -0.34 +/- 0.03 cm/yr) and Southeast River Basin (SEB, -0.24 +/- 0.10 cm/yr). Furthermore, we identified that interannual TWS variations in ten basins of China were primarily driven by soil moisture water storage (SMS) anomalies, exhibiting consistently and relatively high correlations (CC > 0.60) and low root-mean-square errors (RMSE < 5 cm). Lastly, through the integration of GRACE/GFO and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data, we unraveled the contrasting water storage patterns between northern and southern China. Southern China experienced drought conditions, while northern China faced flooding during the 2020-2023 La Nina event, with the inverse pattern observed during the 2014-2016 El Nino event. This study fills in the missing data and quantifies water storage variations within mainland China, contributing to a deeper insight into climate change and its consequences on water resource management.

However, spatial planning of WSUD is not an easy task, not only due to the complex urban environment, but also the fact that not all locations in the catchment are equally effective for flood mitigation. In this study, we developed a new WSUD spatial prioritisation framework that applies global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to identify priority subcatchments where WSUD implementation will be most effective for flood mitigation. For the first time, the complex impact of WSUD locations on catchment flood volume can be assessed, and the GSA in hydrological modelling is adopted for applications in WSUD spatial planning. The framework uses a spatial WSUD planning model, the Urban Biophysical Environments and Technologies Simulator (UrbanBEATS), to generate a grid-based spatial representation of catchment, and an urban drainage model, the U.S. EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), to simulate catchment flooding. The effective imperviousness of all subcatchments was varied simultaneously in the GSA to mimic the effect of WSUD implementation and future developments. Priority subcatchments were identified based on their influence on catchment flooding computed through the GSA. The method was tested for an urbanised catchment in Sydney, Australia. We found that high priority subcatchments were clustering in the upstream and midstream of the main drainage network, with a few distributed close to the catchment outlets. Rainfall frequency, subcatchment characteristics, and pipe network configuration were found to be important factors determining the influence of changes in different subcatchments on catchment flooding. The effectiveness of the framework in identifying influential subcatchments was validated by comparing the effect of removing 6% of the Sydney catchment's effective impervious area under four WSUD spatial distribution scenarios. Our results showed that WSUD implementation in high priority subcatchments consistently achieved the largest flood volume reduction (3.5-31.3% for 1% AEP to 50% AEP storms), followed by medium priority subcatchments (3.1-21.3%) and catchmentwide implementation (2.9-22.1%) under most design storms. Overall, we have demonstrated that the proposed method can be useful for maximising WSUD flood mitigation potential through identifying and targeting the most effective locations.

Nevertheless, the long-term changes in the nutrient contents and their causes in the lower Yellow River (LYR) remain unclear, and the nutrients characteristics during the years with and without WSRS have yet to be compared. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the variations in the nutrient contents and limitations at the Lijin station on the LYR over the past decade, especially during the annual WSRS period, and to compare the water quality characteristics at Lijin between the years with and without WSRS. The results reveal that WSRS significantly changed the seasonal nutrient concentrations (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon) at the Lijin station. The fluxes of these nutrients during WSRS (excluding 2016 and 2017) accounted for 11.64-40.63% of the total annual fluxes. The N concentration in the LYR was higher than that in some global rivers, while the concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved silica (DSi) were lower than the average levels in other rivers. In addition, higher values of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), DSi and the Redfield ratio indicated that the growth of phytoplankton at the Lijin station was strongly restricted by P. However, during the 2 years without WSRS (2016 and 2017), the proportions of the nutrient fluxes in June were less than 66% of those in the WSRS period in other years. Additionally, there was a potential Si limitation in June in these 2 years. Furthermore, due to the occurrence of floods upstream of the Yellow River and the low-level operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, the fluxes of nutrients during WSRS in 2018 were approximately 0.90-4.20 times those during the same period in 2009-2015 and 6.30-35.76 times those in June 2016 and June 2017. This study shows that WSRS effectively changes the nutrient balance in the LYR and provides a reference for the multi-objective collaborative optimization of WSRS to improve siltation and control flood in the LYR.

Agricultural cycles are keyed to the flood arrival, peak, and recession, and fish populations depend on inundated floodplains for their regeneration. However, as factors like climate change and hydropower infrastructure development are altering the Mekong's hydrology, the inundation dynamics of its deltaic floodplains are shifting as well. Several studies have assessed the general changes of river discharge and flood extent on a basin-or delta-wide scale. Yet the sustainable development of this region is relying on dynamics at more local and specific scales, which have not been addressed so far. This paper presents a methodology to track the evolution of hydrological regimes and associated inundations in tropical deltas such as the upper Mekong delta in Cambodia, where it is applied over the past 30 years. Data scarcity and heterogeneity of the environment in this region necessitated the use of combined approaches. We established a link between water levels measured in situ and flood maps derived from optical and radar satellite images (Sentinel-1 and -2).The robustness of the link was assessed using Sentinel, Landsat imagery and the TanDEM-X (12 m) elevation model. This water level-flood link (WAFL) was then used to reconstruct a daily time series of inundation extents reaching back to the beginning of hydrological measurements in 1991 (30 years). On this basis, changes in the incidence, duration, and spatial distribution of floods were analysed. The results indicated that WAFL can be used to reconstruct inundation maps with an overall robustness of 87% in comparison to historical inundation maps derived from remote sensing imagery. Comparisons of WAFLderived flood extents with Landsat images further underscored the significant role of local infrastructure, sedimentation dynamics, and land cover to explain changes in inundation dynamics. WAFL-based analyses revealed that inundation durations have decreased by an average of 19 days when comparing the periods before and after 2008, which was identified as a break point in the hydrological time series. Furthermore, a drastic decrease in inundation the annual frequency with which individual pixels are flooded can be detected during the first half of the traditional flood season, with an average of-21% in early August, negatively impacting water-based livelihoods, from agriculture to fisheries.				christina.orieschnig@ird.fr	Massuel, Sylvain/K-1941-2016; Orieschnig, Christina Anna/ISB-1670-2023	Orieschnig, Christina Anna/0000-0001-5182-7110; Belaud, Gilles/0000-0001-7364-3195; Massuel, Sylvain/0000-0002-5352-0056	French Development Agency (AFD) [FSPI-2021]; Royal University of Agriculture	French Development Agency (AFD); Royal University of Agriculture	The authors thank the French Development Agency (AFD) for its support through the COSTEA project, the Wat-Health project (FSPI-2021) , and our esteemed colleagues at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia as well as the Royal University of Agriculture for their invaluable partnership and support during field work.		86	1	1	5	25	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0022-1694	1879-2707		J HYDROL	J.

Increasing inundation and saltwater intrusion (SWI) will likely adversely affect agricultural production and the associated beach access for tourism. This study uses an integrated surface ground water model to introduce a new approach for retardation of SWI that consists of placing aquifer fill materials along the existing shoreline using Coastal Land Reclamation (CLR). The modeling results suggest that the artificial aquifer materials could be designed to decrease SWI by increasing the infiltration area of coastal precipitation, collecting runoffs from the catchment area, and applying treated wastewater or desalinated brackish water-using coastal wave energy to reduce water treatment costs. The SEAWAT model was applied to verify that it correctly addressed Henry's problem and then applied to the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. In this study, to better inform Coastal Aquifer Management (CAM), we developed four modeling scenarios, namely, Physical Surface Barriers (PSB), including the artificial aquifer widths, permeability, and side slopes and recharge. In the base case scenario without artificial aquifer placement, results show that seawater levels would increase aquifer salinity and displace large amounts of presently available fresh groundwater. More specifically, for the Biscayne aquifer, approximately 0.50% of available fresh groundwater will be lost (that is, 41,192 m(3)) per km of the width of the aquifer considering the increasing seawater level. Furthermore, the results suggest that placing the PSB aquifer with a smaller permeability of < 100 m per day at a width of approximately 615 m increases the available fresh groundwater by approximately 45.20 and 43.90% per km of shoreline, respectively. Similarly, decreasing the slope on the aquifer-ocean side and increasing the aquifer recharge will increase freshwater availability by about 43.90 and 44.50% per km of the aquifer. Finally, placing an aquifer fill along the shallow shoreline increases net revenues to the coastal community through increased agricultural production and possibly tourism that offset fill placement and water treatment costs. This study is useful for integrated management of coastal zones by delaying aquifer salinity, protecting fresh groundwater bodies, increasing agricultural lands, supporting surface water supplies by harvesting rainfall and flash flooding, and desalinating saline water using wave energy. Also, the feasibility of freshwater storage and costs for CAM is achieved in this study.

Glaciers in the eastern and western parts of the Himalayan arc are retreating more rapidly as compared to other regions. This differential retreat is often attributed to climatic, topographic, and geologic influences. The glaciers in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh are believed to be relatively stable as compared to other parts of the western Himalaya. The present study ascertained the area changes and frontal retreat of 87 glaciers in the Pangong Region between 1990 and 2019 using satellite data. The geodetic mass changes were also assessed using SRTM and TanDEM-X digital elevation models of 2000 and 2012 respectively. Besides, the glacier outlines were delineated manually and compared with existing regional and global glacier inventories that are available over the region. The GlabTop model was used to simulate the glacier-bed overdeepenings of four glaciers that are associated with a proglacial lake. The study also analyzed the impact of topographic influences and varying debris cover on glacier recession. This analysis indicated deglaciation of 6.7 +/- 0.1% (0.23% a(-1)) from 1990 to 2019 over the Pangong Region with clean-ice glaciers showing a higher retreat (8.4 +/- 0.28%) compared to the debris-covered glaciers (5.7 +/- 0.14%). However, the overall recession is lower compared to other parts of northwestern Himalayas. The glacier recession showed a positive correlation with mean glacier slope (r = 0.3) and debris cover (r = 0.1) with bigger size glaciers having retreated at a lesser pace compared to smaller ones. This underpins the need for in-situ data about debris thickness to precisely ascertain the role of debris on glacier recession in the Trans-Himalayan Ladakh where debris thickness data is absent. The mean glacier elevation did not indicate any influence on glacier recession. From 2000 to 12, the glaciers lost an ice mass amounting to 0.33 +/- 0.05 m we. per year. The formation of four new proglacial lakes, although small (<6 ha), need to be monitored using remote sensing data while the infrastructure development activities should not be permitted given glacial lake outburst flood risk.

Yet, little is known about the morphological complexity and changes of large braided channels owing to the scarcity of hydrological and topographical data. In this study, we provided the first insight into these issues using compiled long-term (several decades) climatic and suspended sediment data, and Landsat images of braided channels in two nested headwater watersheds (i.e., Tuotuo and Tongtian river watersheds) in the SRYR. Analysis of annual and monthly mean temperature, precipitation, and water discharges illustrated the nature of the hydrological regime and their response to glacier melting in the two watersheds. Examination of annual mean suspended sediment loads and concentrations (C) led to two sediment rating curves and generally similar C values between the two watersheds. Among a suite of morphological indices for braided rivers, braiding intensity may be quantified using four different ones. After comparing the indices, we showed that they had similar ability of characterizing braiding patterns and adopted branch count index (BIT3) for further analysis. We found that BIT3 was linearly correlated with active valley width (W-R) during both flood and dry seasons for the 17 selected braided reaches distributed within the two nested watersheds. In addition, braiding density, defined as the ratio of BIT3 to W-R, remained approximately unchanged irrespective of elevations and locations of these reaches, indicating clearly that morphological structures of braided channels are spatially uniform in the SRYR. Along the main channels of the two nested watersheds over the entire study period, BIT3 always reached the maximum as R-W, defined as the ratio of water body to exposed active riverbed area, was around 0.43. Furthermore, R-W was always positively correlated with the associated water discharge (Q). Variable degrees of braiding adjustment in response to changes of hydrological regime were represented by hysteresis loops between BIT3 and Q. These results revealed relatively homogeneous morphologic properties of braided channels across the two nested watersheds and provided an important benchmark for future morphodynamic research on braided rivers in the SRYR.

These changes are expected to be influenced by the interplay of climate variability and human activities. Quantitatively evaluating these effects is crucial for framing climate variability adaptation measures and the assessment and management of regional water resources. Materials and methods Based on the annual rainfall, runoff, and sediment load data taken over the period from 1974 to 2013 and using data from 112 flood events, this study investigates the runoff and sediment load variations at the annual scale and distinguishes the impacts of climate variability and human activities at the event scale. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test are employed to detect the trends and abrupt change points of the annual runoff and sediment load. Rainfall and land surface conditions play a dominant role in the runoff and sediment yield of flood events. However, vegetation recovery, which benefits from the Grain-for-Green project and the construction of check dams has greatly changed the land surface condition, resulting in a reduction in streamflow energy, hydrological connectivity, and flood peaks. Therefore, for two flood events with similar rainfall conditions but different runoff and sediment yield, the differences in the runoff and sediment load within paired events may be attributed to the changes in the land surface condition induced by human activities. Results and discussion The results showed that the annual runoff and sediment load has significantly decreasing trends (p < 0.05). The abrupt changing point was detected in 1996, dividing the runoff and sediment load series into a baseline period (1974-1995) and a changing period (1996-2013). At the flood event scale, the hysteresis analysis showed that the counter-clockwise and figure-eight loops are the main patterns for both of the periods. The relationships between the runoff depth (H) and sediment yield (SY) varied greatly in 2007-2013 compared with those during 1974-1989. Human activities accounted for an average of 47 and 81% for the changes in the runoff and sediment load, respectively, and the remainder was attributable to climate variability. Conclusions Human activities have a greater effect on the sediment load reduction in the Xichuan River catchment, while climate variability accounted for more of the runoff changes.

To explore the role of snow cover for the land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and water vapor in alpine tundra ecosystems, we combined 3 years (2019-2021) of continuous eddy covariance flux measurements of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) from the Finse site in alpine Norway (1210 ma.s.l.) with a ground-based ecosystem-type classification and satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and MODIS. While the snow conditions in 2019 and 2021 can be described as site typical, 2020 features an extreme snow accumulation associated with a strong negative phase of the Scandinavian pattern of the synoptic atmospheric circulation during spring. This extreme snow accumulation caused a 1-month delay in melt-out date, which falls in the 92nd percentile in the distribution of yearly melt-out dates in the period 2001-2021. The melt-out dates follow a consistent fine-scale spatial relationship with ecosystem types across years. Mountain and lichen heathlands melt out more heterogeneously than fens and flood plains, while late snowbeds melt out up to 1 month later than the other ecosystem types. While the summertime average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was reduced considerably during the extreme-snow year 2020, it reached the same maximum as in the other years for all but one of the ecosystem types (late snowbeds), indicating that the delayed onset of vegetation growth is compensated to the same maximum productivity. Eddy covariance estimates of NEE and ET are gap-filled separately for two wind sectors using a random forest regression model to account for complex and nonlinear ecohydrological interactions. While the two wind sectors differ markedly in vegetation composition and flux magnitudes, their flux response is controlled by the same drivers as estimated by the predictor importance of the random forest model, as well as by the high correlation of flux magnitudes (correlation coefficient r D 0 :92 for NEE and r D 0 :89 for ET) between both areas. The 1-month delay of the start of the snow-free season in 2020 reduced the total annual ET by 50% compared to 2019 and 2021 and reduced the growing-season carbon assimilation to turn the ecosystem from a moderate annual carbon sink (31 to -6 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) to a source (34 to 20 gCm(-2) yr(-1)). These results underpin the strong dependence of ecosystem structure and functioning on snow dynamics, whose anomalies can result in important ecological extreme events for alpine ecosystems.

Polders are low-lying areas of land that have been reclaimed from the sea or from freshwater bodies and are protected from flooding by dikes or other types of flood-protection structures. The water regime in polders is typically managed using a system of canals, pumps, and sluices to control the flow of water in and out of the area. In this study, the temporal changes in water salinity in the polder-type agricultural floodplain within the Neretva River Delta (NRD), Croatia, were analyzed by applying multivariate statistics and forecast modelling. The main aim of the study was to test the model that can be used in practice to forecast, primarily, water suitability for irrigation in a coastal low-lying agricultural catchment. The specific aim of this study was to use hydrochemistry data series to explain processes in water salinity dynamics and to test the model which may provide accurate salinity prediction, or finally select the conditions in which the model can be applied. We considered the accuracy of the model, and it was validated using independent data sets. To describe different patterns of chemical changes in different water classes due to their complex hydrological connectivity, multivariate statistics (PCA) were coupled with time-series analysis and Vector Autoregression (VAR) model forecasting. The multivariate statistics applied here did not indicate a clear connection between water salinity of the surface-water bodies and groundwater. The lack of correlation lies in the complex hydrological dynamics and interconnectivity of the water bodies highly affected by the artificial maintenance of the groundwater level within the polder area, as well as interventions in the temporal release of freshwater into the drainage canal network. Not all individual water classes contributed equally to the dominant patterns of ionic species identified by PCA. Apparently, land use and agricultural management practices in the different polders lead to uneven water chemistry and the predominant contributions of specific ions, especially nutrients. After applying the Granger causality test to reveal the causal information and explain hidden relationships among the variables, only two surface-water and two groundwater monitoring locations displayed a strong causal relationship between water electrical conductivity (ECw) as an effect and sea level as a possible cause. The developed models can be used to evaluate and emphasize the unique characteristics and phenomena of low-lying land and to communicate their importance and influence to management authorities and agricultural producers in managing and planning irrigation management in the wider Mediterranean area.

This is particularly important when considering the combined impact of climate change and human activities. This paper presents an analysis of the changes in sedimentation and erosion of mouth isobaths and underwater deltas over different periods using nautical chart data (1950-2019) and analyzes the factors driving changes in sedimentation and erosion during different periods from 1950 to 2020 based on the runoff-sediment discharge of the Minjiang River (MR) and extreme climate factors such as typhoons, especially the driving factors that caused a sudden change in the sedimentation and erosion process between 1998 and 2005. The results indicate that runoff-sediment characteristics are crucial in driving sedimentation and erosion changes. In the past 70 years, the underwater delta of the MRE has mainly experienced four stages: deposition (1950-1992) -erosion (1993-1998) -deposition (1998-2011) -erosion (2011-2019). Taking the impoundment operation of the Shuikou Reservoir in 1993 as the node, the sediment load of the Minjiang River into the sea began to decrease sharply, and then the estuary quickly showed a state of erosion. The change of sediment flux into the sea is the main driving factor for the evolution of erosion and deposition in the Minjiang River Estuary (MRE). The critical value of the erosion-deposition transition is about 570.3 x 104 t/yr. After the estuary entered a state of erosion in 1993-1998, significant siltation suddenly occurred in 1998-2005. The reason for the siltation in this period may be related to the frequent transit typhoons and flood events in 1998-2005. Therefore, the change of river sediment supply into the sea is the main driving factor controlling the erosion and deposition evolution of the Minjiang River estuary on a long time scale of more than 10 years, which reflects the influence of large-scale human activities on the river and estuary area in the past half century. Extreme climate events are the incentive to adjust the estuary landform in the short term. Extreme climate events will not fundamentally change the process of estuarine geomorphological evolution under the background of sediment supply reduction.

Moreover, this study furthers the application of stochastic physics to evaluate the environmental controls and drivers of flood response. Physically-based climate and time-varying harvesting data are used as covariates to drive the nonstationary flood frequency distribution parameters to detect, attribute, and quantify the effect of harvesting on floods in the snow-dominated Deadman River (878 km2) and nested Joe Ross Creek (99 km2) watersheds. Harvesting only 21% of the watershed caused a 38% and 84% increase in the mean but no increase in variability around the mean of the frequency distribution in the Deadman River and Joe Ross Creek, respectively. Consequently, the 7-year, 20-year, 50-year, and 100-year flood events became approximately two, four, six, and ten times more frequent in both watersheds. An increase in the mean is posited to occur from an increase in moisture availability following harvest from suppressed snow interception and increased net radiation reaching the snowpack. Variability was not increased because snowmelt synchronization was inhibited by the buffering capacity of abundant lakes, evenly distributed aspects, and widespread spatial distribution of cutblocks in the watersheds, preventing any potential for harvesting to in-crease the efficiency of runoff delivery to the outlet. Consistent with similar recent studies, the effect of logging on floods is controlled not only by the harvest rate but most importantly the physiographic characteristics of the watershed and the spatial distribution of the cutblocks. Imposed by the probabilistic framework to understanding and predicting the relation between extremes and their environmental controls, commonly used in the general sciences but not forest hydrology, it is the inherent nature of snowmelt-driven flood regimes which cause even modest increases in magnitude, especially in the upper tail of the distribution, to translate into surprisingly large changes in frequency. Contrary to conventional wisdom, harvesting influenced small, medium, and very large flood events, and the sensitivity to harvest increased with increasing flood event size and watershed area.

Due to the lack of long-term monitoring of glacial lake and glacier changes in the region and the surrounding surface, the spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics and triggering factors of the disaster still need to be determined. Here, we combine multi-temporal optical remote sensing image interpretation, surface deformation monitoring with synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/InSAR, meteorological observation data, and corresponding soil moisture change information to systematically analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and triggering factors of this GLOF disaster. Optical images taken between 1987 and 2020 indicate that the glacial lake's initial area of 0.39 km(2) quickly grew to 0.56 km(2), then plummeted to 0.26 km(2) after the catastrophe. Meanwhile, we found obvious signs of slippage beside the lateral moraine at the junction of the glacier's terminus and the glacial lake. The pixel offset tracking (POT) results based on SAR images acquired before and after the disaster reveal that the western lateral moraine underwent a 40 m line of sight (LOS) deformation. The small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) results from 2017 to 2021 show that the cumulative deformation of the slope around the lateral moraine increased in the rainy season before the disaster, with a maximum cumulative deformation of -52 mm in 120 days and gradually stabilized after the disaster. However, there are three long-term deformation areas on the slope above it, showing an increasing trend after the disaster, with cumulative deformation exceeding -30 mm during the monitoring period. The lateral moraine collapse occurred in a warm climate with continuous and intense precipitation, and the low backscatter intensity prior to the slide suggests that the soil was very moist. Intense rainfall is thought to be the catalyst for lateral moraine collapse, whereas the lateral moraine falling into the glacier lake is the direct cause of the GLOF. This study shows that the joint active-passive remote sensing technique can accurately obtain the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and triggering factors of GLOF. It is helpful to understand the GLOF event caused by the slide of lateral moraine more comprehensively, which is essential for further work related to glacial lake hazard assessment.

Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants actively respond to combinatorial stress remains limited. Among the least studied stress combination is that of flooding and herbivory, despite the growing importance of these stressors in the context of climate change. We investigated plant chemistry and gene expression changes in two heirloom tomato varieties: Cherokee Purple (CP) and Striped German (SG) in response to flooding, herbivory by Spodoptera exigua, and their combination. Results Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in tomato plants subjected to flooding and/or herbivory included several mono- and sesquiterpenes. Flooding was the main factor altering VOCs emission rates, and impacting plant biomass accumulation, while different varieties had quantitative differences in their VOC emissions. At the gene expression levels, there were 335 differentially expressed genes between the two tomato plant varieties, these included genes encoding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase-like, and phytoene synthase (Psy1). Flooding and variety effects together influenced abscisic acid (ABA) signaling genes with the SG variety showing higher levels of ABA production and ABA-dependent signaling upon flooding. Flooding downregulated genes associated with cytokinin catabolism and general defense response and upregulated genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and gibberellin biosynthesis. Combining flooding and herbivory induced the upregulation of genes including chalcone synthase (CHS), PAL, and genes encoding BAHD acyltransferase and UDP-glucose iridoid glucosyltransferase-like genes in one of the tomato varieties (CP) and a disproportionate number of heat-shock proteins in SG. Only the SG variety had measurable changes in gene expression due to herbivory alone, upregulating zeatin, and O-glucosyltransferase and thioredoxin among others. Conclusion Our results suggest that both heirloom tomato plant varieties differ in their production of secondary metabolites including phenylpropanoids and terpenoids and their regulation and activation of ABA signaling upon stress associated with flooding. Herbivory and flooding together had interacting effects that were evident at the level of plant chemistry (VOCs production), gene expression and biomass markers. Results from our study highlight the complex nature of plant responses to combinatorial stresses and point at specific genes and pathways that are affected by flooding and herbivory combined.

J	Jordan, C; Visscher, J; Schlurmann, T				Jordan, Christian; Visscher, Jan; Schlurmann, Torsten			Projected Responses of Tidal Dynamics in the North Sea to Sea-Level Rise and Morphological Changes in the Wadden Sea	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						sea-level rise; climate change; morphological changes; tidal dynamics; North Sea; Wadden Sea; hydrodynamic model	IDEALIZED MODEL; WATER LEVELS; IMPACT; BASINS; FLOOD; TIDES; LONG	This study explores the projected responses of tidal dynamics in the North Sea induced by the interplay between plausible projections of sea-level rise (SLR) and morphological changes in the Wadden Sea. This is done in order to gain insight into the casual relationships between physical drivers and hydro-morphodynamic processes. To achieve this goal, a hydronumerical model of the northwest European shelf seas (NWES) was set-up and validated. By implementing a plausible set of projections for global SLR (SLRRCP8.5 of 0.8 m and SLRhigh-end of 2.0 m) by the end of this century and beyond, the model was run to assess the responses of the regional tidal dynamics. In addition, for each considered SLR, various projections for cumulative rates of vertical accretion were applied to the intertidal flats in the Wadden Sea (ranging from 0 to 100% of projected SLR). Independent of the rate of vertical accretion, the spatial pattern of M2 amplitude changes remains relatively stable throughout most of the model domain for a SLR of 0.8 m. However, the model shows a substantial sensitivity toward the different rates of vertical accretion along the coasts of the Wadden Sea, but also in remote regions like the Skagerrak. If no vertical accretion is assumed in the intertidal flats of the Wadden Sea, the German Bight and the Danish west coast are subject to decreases in M2 amplitudes. In contrast, those regions experience increases in M2 amplitudes if the local intertidal flats are able to keep up with the projected SLR of 0.8 m. Between the different scenarios, the North Frisian Wadden Sea shows the largest differences in M2 amplitudes, locally varying by up to 14 cm. For a SLR of 2.0 m, the M2 amplitude changes are even more amplified. Again, the differences between the various rates of vertical accretion are largest in the North Frisian Wadden Sea (> 20 cm). The local distortion of the tidal wave is also significantly different between the scenarios. In the case of no vertical accretion, tidal asymmetry in the German estuaries increases, leading to a potentially enhanced sediment import. The presented results have strong implications for local coastal protection strategies and navigation in adjacent estuaries. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Jordan, Christian; Visscher, Jan; Schlurmann, Torsten] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, Hannover, Germany	Leibniz University Hannover	Jordan, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, Hannover, Germany.	jordan@lufi.uni-hannover.de	Schlurmann, Torsten/AAE-8223-2019	Jordan, Christian/0000-0003-0618-2549; Schlurmann, Torsten/0000-0002-4691-7629					57	3	3	2	10	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		2296-7745		FRONT MAR SCI	Front.

Spatial and Seasonal Variations of C, Nutrient, and Metal Concentration in Thermokarst Lakes of Western Siberia Across a Permafrost Gradient	WATER			English	Article						permafrost; lake; trace metals; carbon; season; thermokarst; Western Siberia	TRACE-ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS; ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHERN QUEBEC; THAWING PERMAFROST; CYCLIC DEVELOPMENT; DISSOLVED CARBON; SURFACE WATERS; CO2; DYNAMICS	Thermokarst lakes and ponds formed due to thawing of frozen peat in high-latitude lowlands are very dynamic and environmentally important aquatic systems that play a key role in controlling C emission to atmosphere and organic carbon (OC), nutrient, and metal lateral export to rivers and streams. However, despite the importance of thermokarst lakes in assessing biogeochemical functioning of permafrost peatlands in response to climate warming and permafrost thaw, spatial (lake size, permafrost zone) and temporal (seasonal) variations in thermokarst lake hydrochemistry remain very poorly studied. Here, we used unprecedented spatial coverage (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zone of the western Siberia Lowland) of 67 lakes ranging in size from 10(2)to 10(5)m(2)for sampling during three main hydrological periods of the year: spring flood, summer baseflow, and autumn time before ice-on. We demonstrate a systematic, all-season decrease in the concentration of dissolved OC (DOC) and an increase in SO4, N-NO3, and some metal (Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Sr, U, Sb) concentration with an increase in lake surface area, depending on the type of the permafrost zone. These features are interpreted as a combination of (i) OC and organically bound metal leaching from peat at the lake shore, via abrasion and delivery of these compounds by suprapermafrost flow, and (ii) deep groundwater feeding of large lakes (especially visible in the continuous permafrost zone). Analyses of lake water chemical composition across the permafrost gradient allowed a first-order empirical prediction of lake hydrochemical changes in the case of climate warming and permafrost thaw, employing a substituting space for time scenario. The permafrost boundary shift northward may decrease the concentrations and pools of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Li, B, Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ni, Cu, As, Rb, Mo, Sr, Y, Zr, rare Earth elements (REEs), Th, and U by a factor of 2-5 in the continuous permafrost zone, but increase the concentrations of CH4, DOC, NH4, Cd, Sb, and Pb by a factor of 2-3. In contrast, the shift of the sporadic to isolated zone may produce a 2-5-fold decrease in CH4, DOC, NH4, Al, P, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ga, Zr, Nb, Cs, REEs, Hf, Th, and U. The exact magnitude of this response will, however, be strongly seasonally dependent, with the largest effects observable during baseflow seasons.

Floods have gained global significance owing to their devastating impact and their capacity to cause economic and human loss. Accurate flood forecasting and the identification of high-risk areas are essential for preventing flood impacts and implementing strategic measures to mitigate flood-related damages. In this study, an assessment of the susceptibility to riverine flooding in India was conducted utilizing Multicriteria Decision making (MCDM) and an extensive geospatial database was created through the integration of fourteen geomorphological, meteorological, hydroclimatic, and anthropogenic factors. The coupled methodology incorporates a Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model, which utilizes Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFN) to determine the Importance Weights (IWs) of various parameters and their subclasses based on the Saaty scale. Based on the determined IWs, this study identifies proximity to rivers, drainage density, and mean annual rainfall as the key factors that contribute significantly to the occurrence of riverine floods. Furthermore, as the Geographic Information System (GIS) was employed to create the Riverine Flood Susceptibility (RFS) map of India by overlaying the weighted factors, it was found that high, moderate, and low susceptibility zones across the country span of 15.33%, 26.30%, and 31.35% of the total area of the country, respectively. The regions with the highest susceptibility to flooding are primarily concentrated in the Brahmaputra, Ganga, and Indus River basins, which happen to encompass a significant portion of the country's agricultural land (334,492 km2) potentially posing a risk to India's food security. Approximately 28.13% of built-up area in India falls in the highly susceptible zones, including cities such as Bardhaman, Silchar, Kharagpur, Howrah, Kolkata, Patna, Munger, Bareilly, Allahabad, Varanasi, Lucknow, and Muzaffarpur, which are particularly susceptible to flooding. RFS is moderate in the Kutch-Saurashtra-Luni, Western Ghats, and Krishna basins. On the other hand, areas on the outskirts of the Ganga, Indus, and Brahmaputra basins, as well as the middle and outer portions of the peninsular basins, show a relatively low likelihood of riverine flooding. The RFS map created in this research, with an 80.2% validation accuracy assessed through AUROC analysis, will function as a valuable resource for Indian policymakers, urban planners, and emergency management agencies. It will aid them in prioritizing and executing efficient strategies to reduce flood risks effectively.

The concept of flood drainage rights (FDR), or the legal rights of regions to drain floodwaters into river reaches, is used in watershed planning in China. Quantifying the allocation of FDR remains challenging, where some previous methods have resulted in unreasonable or impractical allocation plans due to incomplete consideration of driving factors or the use of unscientific allocation methods. This study ex-plores the allocation plan of FDR in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Watershed in China. Climatic variability and change have caused frequent flooding in portions of the basin, with significant societal and economic implications. First, we comprehensively analyzed factors driving FDR for regions in the watershed. Following the conceptual flood resilience strategy currently being advocated for the region, we considered natural, socioeconomic, governance, resilience, and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of FDR and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors. Second, we quantified FDR values for flood-prone regions in the middle and lower river reaches of this major river basin. We introduced a specific deep learning method, called the variational autoencoder (VAE) model, to quantify FDR allocation, providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi-objective, high-dimensional, nonlinear, and non-normal distribution of factors driving FDR allocation. Next, using data from 2005 to 2019, this model was applied to the study area. The allocation of FDR (summing to 100%) across five flood-prone provinces of the watershed includes Inner Mongolia (9.36%), Shaanxi (10.00%), Shanxi (10.95%), Henan (32.58%), and Shan-dong (37.12%). Using the harmony evaluation method based on harmony theory, we compared the new VAE allocation method with three conventional allocation methods. The VAE allocation method has the highest degree of harmony, suggesting that it is the most practical for FDR allocation and is a reasonable allocation for flood management. Such FDR can work with water conservancy engineering facilities as part of a comprehensive management system toward protecting public health, minimizing economic losses, and preserving functions of development and natural lands within floodplains of the Yellow River.

A total of 89 AMS C-14 measurements on samples from 66 horizons, including animal cartilage, shell and total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediments show apparent C-14 ages between 500 and 4000 yr BP. Among these AMS dates, (DC)-C-14 values measured in 78 samples from 62 horizons vary in the range of -64.3 parts per thousand to -383.8 parts per thousand. The C-14(TOC) ages much older than predicted from our sedimentation model are influenced by the input of terrigenous sediments, changes in ocean circulation, biological input and carbon remineralization. Three strong old C-14(TOC) excursions at 1964-69, 1884-87 and 1819-21 CE indicate higher old carbon input caused by some unusual events (e.g., oil spill, flood event and earthquake). On multi-decadal timescales, the (DCTOC)-C-14 shifts in three zones were mainly caused by changes in fossil carbon emission from the seafloor, fraction of marine productivity to terrigenous input of organic carbon (OC) and the atmospheric nuclear bomb testing input of C-14 into the SBB. On interannual to decadal timescales, variations of (DCTOC)-C-14 correspond to El Nino-Southern Oscillation effects. During the La Nina period, stronger upwelling and northerly California Current bring nutrient-enriched water into SBB and lead to higher productivity hence more marine OC with higher (DCTOC)-C-14. In addition, reduced terrigenous input of OC with lower (DC)-C-14 under less coastal rainfall during La Nina could further elevate the (DCTOC)-C-14. Lower scanning XRF (K+Ti)/2 (indicating lower terrigenous input), higher scanning XRF Sr/Ti as well as acid-leachable elements (reflecting higher biogenic components), and higher (DCTOC)-C-14 occur during La Nina. During the El Nino period, the phenomena are opposite. Spectrum analyses of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the (DCTOC)-C-14 as well as the comparison of SOI and SBB-8-2012 records support our scenarios.

Crayfish connections: Linking ecology and hydrogeology in Alabama's Black Prairie using crayfish distribution patterns	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						community composition; floodplain pool; groundwater; local biodiversity; primary burrower	PRIMARY BURROWING CRAYFISH; DECAPODA CAMBARIDAE; CONSERVATION STATUS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; HISTORY; WETLAND; ROLES; SCALE	Floodplain ecosystems host diverse surface-water habitats (e.g., lotic, lentic, ephemeral) and groundwater features that support high levels of species diversity. Our understanding of species-habitat relationships within these complex ecosystems, however, remains incomplete, potentially hindering conservation efforts. Understanding associations between burrowing crayfish and habitat features of floodplains is particularly valuable because crayfish, through burrowing, play an important role in establishing aquatic-terrestrial connections which enhance local biodiversity. Species of crayfish that persist in floodplains must burrow deep enough to access shallow groundwater. Consequently, burrow presence may indicate a preference for specific surface and subsurface habitat characteristics. The primary goal of our study was to evaluate specific habitat attributes as predictors of burrowing crayfish presence/absence, and our secondary goal was to evaluate species-specific habitat associations with respect to the same environmental variables. We evaluated burrowing crayfish presence/absence and crayfish species composition with respect to groundwater depth, flood frequency (standing surface water), soil characteristics, and tree size in the Bogue Chitto Creek catchment, Dallas County, Alabama, U.S.A. Active burrows were expected at sites with access to water (a shallow water table) and at sites with environmental variables more conducive to burrow stability (fine-grained soils and mature trees). Species composition was predicted to vary with groundwater depth and flood frequency. Groundwater depth was the primary driver of burrowing crayfish presence/absence in our system; active burrows were more likely to be present in areas with relatively shallow groundwater depths. Within occupied sites, differences in crayfish species composition were significantly associated with the degree of flooding during the 1-year study period. Species associated with a high dependence on surface waters were collected alongside species dependent on burrowing to access groundwater, suggesting that the environmental features of floodplains satisfy a diverse set of requirements. In particular, sites offering a mosaic of accessible groundwater depths and floodplain pools may provide critical habitat for diverse assemblages of burrowing crayfish species. Our study revealed a strong association between the presence/absence of active crayfish burrows and the depth to groundwater, a result that supports using burrowing crayfish as indicators of accessible groundwater. This will be increasingly important in the context of how climate change might influence water availability and local species diversity.

Effect of inundation on greenhouse gas emissions from temperate coastal wetland soils with different vegetation types in southern Australia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Coastal wetland; Soil organic carbon; Inundation; Redox potential; Greenhouse gases; Woody vegetation; Herbaceous vegetation	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSION; ORGANIC-MATTER MINERALIZATION; YELLOW-RIVER ESTUARY; FRESH-WATER MARSH; CARBON-DIOXIDE; METHANE EMISSIONS; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; N2O EMISSIONS; IN-SITU; HYDROELECTRIC DAMS	Predicted sea level fluctuations and sea level rise with climate change will lead to inundation of coastal and estuarine soils. Coastal wetlands usually contain large amounts of organic matter, which can be potential sources of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; CO2, CH4, N2O) during decomposition, but there are limited studies on the effects of sea level variation on GHGs in coastal wetlands. We measured the effect of brackish water inundation and wetting and drying cycles on GHG emissions from coastal wetland soil cores that supported four different vegetation types: Apiurn gravedens (AG), Leptospermurn lanigerurn (LL), Phragmites australis (PA) and Paspalum distichurn (PD) from the estuarine floodplain of the Aire River in south-western Victoria, Australia. Intact soil cores were incubated under either dry, flooded, or a 14 day wet-dry cycle treatments for a total of 56 days at a constant temperature of 23 degrees C. CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were investigated in closed chambers and measured with gas chromatography. In the dry treatment, a positive correlation was found between soil organic carbon (SOC) and CO2 flux, and between SOC and CH4 flux. Higher SOC is indicative of higher amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) which acts as a source of substrate for microbes to produce CO2 or CH4 emissions under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The NO2 and NO3 concentrations were positively correlated with N2O emissions in the wet-dry cycle treatment. NO2- and NO3- provide a supply of substrate for denitrification. The flooded treatment decreased cumulative CO2 emissions by 34%,25% and 14% at the LL PA, PD sites, respectively, and decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 42%, 39% and 43% at the AG, LL and PA sites, compared to the dry treatment. The wet-dry cycle treatment and dry treatment decreased cumulative CH4 emissions for all vegetation types compared to the flooded treatment. The redox potential (Eh) was negatively correlated with CH4 flux and positively correlated N2O flux at all sites. This study highlights the significance of sea level fluctuations when estimating GHG flux from coastal and estuarine floodplains which are highly vulnerable to inundation, and the role of SOC and mineral N as important drivers affecting GHG flux.

Lake ecosystems are no exception and are expected to cope with the consequences of extreme climatic events (hereafter ECE), such as storms, floods, and droughts. These events have significant potential to alter the hydrological characteristics (HC) influencing the physical, chemical, and biological behavior of lake ecosystems. Considering such ecosystem's high-value services and benefits, it is the need of the hour to monitor and evaluate the impact of ECE on lake ecosystems. The second-largest brackish water system in the world, Chilika Lake, situated at the shore of the Bay of Bengal (BoB), has encountered a total of 1306 tropical cyclonic storms in the last 131 years. Since most tropical cyclones lead to heavy floods, this could be devastating for the ecosystem and its services. Hence, in order to bridge the knowledge gap, the present study was carried out to understand its impact, based on the available field data of more than two decades (1999 to 2020) and historical records of ECE and HC since 1840 and 1915 respectively from the literature. The study revealed that the ECE attributed to short-term changes in HC which were reflected through an immediate change in trophic state index (TSI, indicator of lake health) and trophic switchover (net autotrophic to heterotrophic) between net sink and source of carbon dioxide (CO2) in specific regions. This study showed that both the ECE as well as a human intervention (opening of the new mouth) had an integrated role in the maintenance of HC within the lake as indicated by the variability of salinity level which is the lifeblood of the Chilika. Major ECE factors which controlled the salinity in Chilika were freshwater input through cyclone-induced flash flooding and seawater exchange through varying mouth conditions, i.e., opening of the new mouth, shifting, and widening of existing mouths due to cyclone impacts. The impact of the cyclone-induced flash flood was sustained for a couple of months to years depending on the magnitudes. As evidenced from the historical data available for ECEs, respective mouth variability, and salinity regime, ECE was found to maintain the salinity regime of the lake in the long run. Since the hydrological characteristics are found to be maintained through ECE as well as human intervention, the Chilika Lake recorded a substantial increase in fishery, seagrasses, Irrawaddy dolphins, migratory birds, and reduction in weed infestation. This study highlights the importance of historical data collection through a continuous systematic lake monitoring program which would enable understanding the ecosystem functioning and behavior with ECE-induced changing environmental conditions which is also a key component for formulating a sustainable management action plan for lake ecosystems around the globe.

However, these active processes are often neglected in flood management because calculations are based on static parameters. The aim of this study is to analyse the processes that contribute to rising local flood levels in a regulated channel and on an artificially confined floodplain of a lowland river. Our goals were to evaluate the role of cross-sectional channel changes, overbank floodplain aggradation, and riparian land-cover changes on local flood level increases since the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century and to assess the height changes of artificial levees. The research was performed in a low-gradient river (Lower Tisza, Hungary), which was regulated in the late nineteenth century; thus, the effects of century-long processes on flood levels could be evaluated. The results suggest that along the 92 km-long reach, the channel was narrowed by 9% and its cross-sectional area decreased by an average of 2%; however, the narrowing was over 30% in some locations. Because of these changes, flood levels increased by an average of 13 cm (maximum = 134 cm) since 1931. Because the artificial levee was constructed in the mid-nineteenth century, the mean overbank floodplain accumulation reached 1.2 m (maximum = 2.6 m), flood levels decreased by an average of 112 cm. During the same period, the land cover of the floodplain changed considerably, increasing the vegetation roughness (i.e., Manning's n) from 0.048 to 0.11. Based on our modelled data, the higher vegetation roughness increased flood levels by 42 cm (Scenario A) or 139 cm (Scenario B), on average, based on the increased vegetation roughness (by 10% or 30%, respectively). By overlapping these data, the results showed that since the river regulation work in the late nineteenth century, the actual flood level increased by an average of 175 cm (maximum = 350 cm) in the case of Scenario A and 272 cm (maximum = 443 cm) in the case of Scenario B. The latter is more consistent with the actual flood stage measurements. As these processes are still active, further increases in the flood level could be expected. In addition, the height of artificial levees decreased by an average of 23 cm (maximum = 75 cm); thus, some levee sections became more susceptible to overtopping during record high floods, especially along the eastern levee. Based on this approach, local hydrological managers can identify the processes that contribute more to peak flow level increases at a given location and determine the correct actions at the correct locations, which could lead to decreases in peak flow levels.

This calls for accurate elevation data for flood risk assessments, especially in the densely populated Southeast Asian deltas. However, in data-poor countries such as Myanmar, where high accuracy elevation data are not accessible, often only global satellite-based digital elevation models (DEMs), suffering from low vertical accuracy and remote sensing artefacts, can be used by the public and scientific community. As the lack of accurate elevation data hampers the assessment of flood risk, studying available information on land elevation and its reliability is essential, particularly in the context of sea level rise impact. Here, we assess the performance of 10 global DEMs in the Ayeyarwady Delta (Myanmar) against the new, local, so-called AD-DEM, which was generated based on topographical map elevation data. To enable comparison, all DEMs were converted to a common vertical datum tied to local sea level. While both CoastalDEM v2.1 (Kulp and Strauss, 2021) and FABDEM (Hawker et al., 2022) perform comparably well, showing the highest correspondence in comparison with AD-DEM and low-elevation spot heights, FABDEM outperforms CoastalDEM v2.1 by the absence of remote sensing artefacts. The AD-DEM provides a high-accuracy, open and freely available, and independent elevation dataset suitable for evaluating land elevation data in the Ayeyarwady Delta and studying topography and flood risk at large scale, while small-scale investigations may benefit from a FABDEM locally improved with data from the AD-DEM. Based on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of sea level rise, the consequences of DEM selection for assessing the impact of sea level rise in the Ayeyarwady Delta are shown. We highlight the need for addressing particularly low-lying populated areas within the most seaward districts with risk mitigation and adaptation strategies while also the more inland delta population should be made aware of facing a higher risk of flooding due to relative sea level rise in the next similar to 100 years.

These biologically diverse landscapes are a principal source of subsistence to 16 million people, including various ethnographic groups. This paper focuses on a case study involving Hutsul communities, an ethnographic group of traditional pastoral highlanders, in the Southeastern Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine. Given ecosystem, climatic, and cultural challenges, especially the rise of illegal logging, commercial harvesting, increased frequencies of flooding, and now a war, Hutsul communities face extensive threats to maintaining socio-ecological resilience in the region. A contributing factor to the region's centuries-long resilience is traditional ecological knowledge upholding food sovereignty as seen through traditional foods derived from Carpathian Mountain ecosystems. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is as a dynamic, generationally-held knowledge base, where language, gathering practices, landscape and culture inform livelihoods. In this article, we seek to answer the following series of questions within Hutsul communities: (1) What does TEK look like in the region? (2) What are the regional environmental challenges? (3) Given these challenges, what are coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies grounded in TEK, ensuring a resilient food sovereign system? Mixed methodologies guided by community-based participatory action research methods (CBPAR) between 2017 and 2019 provide a rich, context-driven perspective on regional TEK. Radiating out from the historical, cultural Hutsul capital, Verkhovyna, 40 experts (including knowledge holders, elders, foresters, and community members) were interviewed in 8 neighboring villages. We, along with Hutsul experts, explore the presence of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in Hutsulshchyna by identifying 108 culturally important species including wild plants (74 species), cultivated plants (23 species), fungi (9 species) and lichens (2 species); these species are gathered in 10 habitats with varying degrees of human interaction. We analyze species' presence in traditional foods in the past and present day, as well as contextualize regional environmental challenges impacting TEK practices, and responses to these challenges (coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies). Despite various regional challenges, we conclude that TEK provides a resilient foundation for supporting food sovereignty as seen through the presence of traditional foods.

Owing to the scarcity of data, this particular subject has captured less attention in Rwanda. However, semi-distributed hydrological models have become standard tools used to investigate hydrological processes in data-scarce regions. Thus, this study aimed to develop a hydrological modeling system for the Nyabarongo River catchment in Rwanda, and assess its hydrological response to rainfall events through discharged flow and volume simulation. Initially, the terrain Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was pre-processed using a geospatial tool (HEC-GeoHMS) for catchment delineation and the generation of input physiographic parameters was applied for hydrological modeling system (HEC-HMS) setup. The model was then calibrated and validated at the outlet using sixteen events extracted from daily hydro-meteorological data (rainfall and flow) for the rainy seasons of the country. More than in other events, the 15th, 9th, 13th and 5th events showed high peak flows with simulated values of 177.7 m(3)s(-1), 171.7 m(3)s(-1), 169.9 m(3)s(-1), and 166.9 m(3)s(-1), respectively. The flow fluctuations exhibited a notable relation to rainfall variations following long and short rainy seasons. Comparing the observed and simulated hydrographs, the findings also unveiled the ability of the model to simulate the discharged flow and volume of the Nyabarongo catchment very well. The evaluated model's performance exposed a high mean Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 81.4% and 84.6%, with correlation coefficients (R-2) of 88.4% and 89.8% in calibration and validation, respectively. The relative errors for the peak flow (5.5% and 7.7%) and volume (3.8% and 4.6%) were within the acceptable range for calibration and validation, respectively. Generally, HEC-HMS findings provided a satisfactory computing proficiency and necessitated fewer data inputs for hydrological simulation under changing rainfall patterns in the Nyabarongo River catchment. This study provides an understanding and deepening of the knowledge of river flow mechanisms, which can assist in establishing systems for river monitoring and early flood warning in Rwanda.

Quantifying the impacts of future sea level rise on nesting sea turtles in the southeastern United States	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						coastal nesting; coastal squeeze; global change; sea level rise; sea turtle; storm surge	CONFER FITNESS BENEFITS; SITE SELECTION; LOGGERHEAD TURTLES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARETTA-CARETTA; SAND CHARACTERISTICS; CHELONIA-MYDAS; LONG-TERM; BEACH; TEMPERATURE	Sandy beaches, a necessary habitat for nesting sea turtles, are increasingly under threat as they become squeezed between human infrastructure and shorelines that are changing as a result of rising sea levels. Forecasting where shifting sandy beaches will be obstructed and how that directly impacts coastal nesting species is necessary for successful conservation and management. Predicting changes to coastal nesting areas is difficult because of a lack of consensus on the physical attributes used by females in nesting site choice. In this study, we leveraged long-term data sets of nesting localities for two sea turtle species, loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, and green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, within four barrier island National Seashores in the southeastern United States to predict future nesting beach area based on where these species currently nest in relation to mean high water. We predicted the future location of nesting areas based on a sea level rise scenario for 2100 and quantified how impervious surfaces will inhibit future beach movement, which will impact both the total available nesting area and the percentage of nesting area predicted to flood following a hurricane-related storm surge. Contrary to our expectations, those barrier islands with the greatest levels of human infrastructure were not projected to experience the greatest percentage of sea turtle nesting area loss due to sea level rise or storm surge events. Notably, loss of nesting beach areas will not have equal impacts across the four Seashores; the Seashore projected to have the least amount of total nesting area lost and percentage nesting area lost currently has the highest nesting densities of our two study species, suggesting that even low levels of beach loss could have substantial impacts on future nesting densities and disproportionate impacts on the population growth of these species. Our novel method of estimating current and future nesting beach area can be broadly applied to studies requiring a bounded area that encompasses the part of a beach used by nesting coastal species and will be useful in comparing future global nesting densities and population trajectories under projected future sea level rise and storm surge activity.

To assess these responses, surface soil samples (0-1 cm) and intact soil cores (10 cm depth) were collected from an urban meadow in Baton Rouge, LA subsequent to an unprecedented flood during August 2016. During the flood, a topographically low region of the meadow (LM) was inundated for at least several days, while an elevated area (upper meadow or UM) was not flooded. Microbial community composition and diversity at each site were assessed for soils collected from cores at various depths over the upper 10 cm before and after 3 days of experimental flooding ex situ. Cores from LM and UM were also used to assess methane fluxes before and after the experimental flooding. The results indicated that methane fluxes differed between LM and UM sites, and that they were affected by flooding. LM cores emitted methane prior to flooding, and rates increased substantially post-flooding: UM cores consumed methane to levels below ambient atmospheric concentrations prior to flooding, but emitted methane post-flooding. In contrast both LM and UM microbial communities were resistant to short-term flooding, with no significant changes observed at either site, or at any depth interval from the surface to 10 cm. However, LM and UM soil communities differed significantly, with distinct distributions of Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Thaumarchaeota among others. Based on responses of soil cores to experimental flooding, the differences between sites in microbial communities did not appear to be residual effects of the August, 2016 flood, but rather appeared to arise from physical, chemical, and biological variables that change along a 4-m elevation gradient. Collectively, the results suggest that the composition and diversity for some urban soils might be insensitive to short-term flooding, but that important biogeochemical processes, e.g., methane fluxes, might respond rapidly.

J	Kushnir, Y; Stein, M				Kushnir, Yochanan; Stein, Mordechai			Medieval Climate in the Eastern Mediterranean: Instability and Evidence of Solar Forcing	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						Mediterranean; climate change; climate variability; extreme events	DEAD-SEA; LONG-TERM; FERTILE CRESCENT; SAHEL RAINFALL; MIDDLE-EAST; NILE FLOODS; NEAR-EAST; EL-NINO; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT	This paper examines the hydroclimate history of the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region during the 10th to 14th centuries C.E., a period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), a time of significant historical turmoil and change in the region. The study assembles several regional hydroclimatic archives, primarily the Dead Sea reconstructed lake level curve together with the recently extracted deep-lake sediment record, the Soreq Cave speleothem record and its counterpart, the EM marine sediment record and the Cairo Nilometer record of annual maximum summer flood levels in lower Egypt. The Dead Sea record is a primary indicator of the intensity of the EM cold-season storm activity while the Nilometer reflects the intensity of the late summer monsoon rains over Ethiopia. These two climate systems control the annual rainfall amounts and water availability in the two regional breadbaskets of old, in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The paleoclimate archives portray a variable MCA in both the Levant and the Ethiopian Highlands with an overall dry, early-medieval climate that turned wetter in the 12th century C.E. However, the paleoclimatic records are markedly punctuated by episodes of extreme aridity. In particular, the Dead Sea displays extreme low lake levels and significant salt deposits starting as early as the 9th century C.E. and ending in the late 11th century. The Nile summer flood levels were particularly low during the 10th and 11th centuries, as is also recorded in a large number of historical chronicles that described a large cluster of droughts that led to dire human strife associated with famine, pestilence and conflict. During that time droughts and cold spells also affected the northeastern Middle East, in Persia and Mesopotamia. Seeking an explanation for the pronounced aridity and human consequences across the entire EM, we note that the 10th-11th century events coincide with the medieval Oort Grand Solar Minimum, which came at the height of an interval of relatively high solar irradiance. Bringing together other tropical and Northern Hemisphere paleoclimatic evidence, we argue for the role of long-term variations in solar irradiance in shaping the early MCA in the EM and highlight their relevance to the present and near-term future.

J	Yadav, A; Upreti, H; Singhal, GD				Yadav, Aditi; Upreti, Hitesh; Singhal, Gopal Das			Crop water stress index and its sensitivity to meteorological parameters and canopy temperature	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							SCHEDULING IRRIGATION; INFRARED THERMOMETRY; BASE-LINES; WHEAT; DRIP; MANAGEMENT; IMAGERY; CWSI	The adverse impacts of climate change and the disparity between water availability and demand in agriculture necessitate the development of water-efficient irrigation schedules. The empirically derived crop water stress index (CWSI) is a popular tool for the detection of water stress in crops and the scheduling of water-efficient irrigation regimes. But the sensitivity of the empirical CWSI to the input parameters, i.e., air temperature (Ta), canopy temperature (Tc), and relative humidity (RH), is rarely studied. This study is conducted on wheat crops in the Uttar Pradesh province of India where four irrigation scheduling strategies/treatments are experimented with to study CWSI and its sensitivity to Tc and meteorological parameters (Ta and RH). Two irrigation scheduling strategies correspond to drip irrigation and the remaining two correspond to flood irrigation. The mean CWSI values, derived by empirical approach, are 0.11 and 0.03 for drip irrigated treatments and 0.29 and 0.31 for flood irrigated treatments. To observe the sensitivity of the empirical CWSI to the input parameters, initially, the accuracies of the research-grade equipment, used for taking Tc, Ta, and RH observations, are used as error values in the input parameters. This resulted in 3.5 to 7% errors in the empirically derived CWSI values. A maximum error of 2.7% was observed in CWSI values when an error of 10% was introduced in the RH data. The maximum error in CWSI (52%) was observed for the case when a combined error in Ta, Tc, and RH by -1 degrees C, 1 degrees C, and 10%, respectively, were introduced. A random error in the range -1 to 1 degrees C in Tc resulted in a maximum CWSI error of 21%. Out of the three input parameters, CWSI was found to be least sensitive to RH and with sensitivity to both Ta and Tc showing similar trends. A common pattern of decreasing error in CWSI values for increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was observed for all the studied cases. The results show that the water stress, as reflected by the CWSI values, was significantly lower for the drip irrigation treatments as compared to the flood irrigation treatments. Also, small errors in the input parameters may combine to result in significant errors in empirically derived CWSI. Hence, data quality is critical for the studies that utilize CWSI for irrigation scheduling, especially in humid climatic conditions.

J	Ahmed, T; Creedon, L; Gharbia, SS				Ahmed, Tasneem; Creedon, Leo; Gharbia, Salem S.			Low-Cost Sensors for Monitoring Coastal Climate Hazards: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	SENSORS			English	Review						coastal hazards; low-cost sensors; climate change	FROM-MOTION PHOTOGRAMMETRY; COASTVIEW PROJECT; STORM-SURGE; SEA-LEVEL; BEACH; ZONE; GPS; SHORELINE; NETWORK; TIDE	Unequivocal change in the climate system has put coastal regions around the world at increasing risk from climate-related hazards. Monitoring the coast is often difficult and expensive, resulting in sparse monitoring equipment lacking in sufficient temporal and spatial coverage. Thus, low-cost methods to monitor the coast at finer temporal and spatial resolution are imperative for climate resilience along the world's coasts. Exploiting such low-cost methods for the development of early warning support could be invaluable to coastal settlements. This paper aims to provide the most up-to-date low-cost techniques developed and used in the last decade for monitoring coastal hazards and their forcing agents via systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature in three scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect. A total of 60 papers retrieved from these databases through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol were analysed in detail to yield different categories of low-cost sensors. These sensors span the entire domain for monitoring coastal hazards, as they focus on monitoring coastal zone characteristics (e.g., topography), forcing agents (e.g., water levels), and the hazards themselves (e.g., coastal flooding). It was found from the meta-analysis of the retrieved papers that terrestrial photogrammetry, followed by aerial photogrammetry, was the most widely used technique for monitoring different coastal hazards, mainly coastal erosion and shoreline change. Different monitoring techniques are available to monitor the same hazard/forcing agent, for instance, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), time-lapse cameras, and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for monitoring coastal morphological changes such as beach erosion, creating opportunities to not only select but also combine different techniques to meet specific monitoring objectives. The sensors considered in this paper are useful for monitoring the most pressing challenges in coastal zones due to the changing climate. Such a review could be extended to encompass more sensors and variables in the future due to the systematic approach of this review. This study is the first to systematically review a wide range of low-cost sensors available for the monitoring of coastal zones in the context of changing climate and is expected to benefit coastal researchers and managers to choose suitable low-cost sensors to meet their desired objectives for the regular monitoring of the coast to increase climate resilience.

Influence of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on temperature mean and precipitation extremes indices in Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stratospheric aerosol injection; GeoMIP; Africa; Temperature; Precipitation; Climate extremes	REGIONAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; INJECTION; RESPONSES; DROUGHT; EVENTS; TRENDS	Purpose Three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models involved in the G4 experiment of the Geoengineering Model Inter-comparison Project (GeoMIP) project were used to investigate the impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) on the mean surface air temperature and precipitation extremes in Africa. Design/methodology/approach This impact was examined under G4 and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenarios on the total precipitation, the number of rainy days (RR1) and of days with heavy rainfall (R20 mm), the rainfall intensity (SDII), the maximum length of consecutive wet (CWD) and dry (CDD) days and on the maximum rainfall in five consecutive days (Rx5day) across four regions: Western Africa (WAF), Eastern Africa (EAF), Northern Africa and Southern Africa (SAF). Findings During the 50 years (2020-2069) of SAI, mean continental warming is -0.40 degrees C lower in G4 than under RCP4.5. During the post-injection period (2070-2090), the temperature continues to increase, but at a lower rate (-0.19 degrees C) than in RCP4.5. During SAI, annual rainfall in G4 is significantly greater than in RCP4.5 over the high latitudes (especially over SAF) and lower over the tropics. The termination of SAI leads to a significant increase of rainfall over Sahel and EAF and a decrease over SAF and Guinea Coast (WAF). Practical implications Compared to RCP4.5, SAI will contribute to reducing significantly regional warming but with a significant decrease of rainfall in the tropics where rainfed agriculture account for a large part of the economies. After the SAI period, the risk of drought over the extratropical regions (especially in SAF) will be mitigated, while the risk of floods will be exacerbated in the Central Sahel. Originality/value To meet the Paris Agreement, African countries will implement mitigation measures to contribute to keep the surface air temperature below 2 degrees C. Geoengineering with SAI is suggested as an option to meet this challenge, but its implication on the African climate system needs a deep investigation in the aim to understand the impacts on temperature and precipitation extremes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the potential impact of SAI using the G4 experiment of GeoMIP on temperature and precipitation extremes of the African continent.

By facilitating oxygen penetration into anoxic layers, bioturbation alters the overall sediment biogeochemistry. In intertidal systems, the type and role of interactions among sediment microorganisms, animals, plants and abiotic factors are complex and not well understood. Such interactions are known to promote nutrient provision and cycling, and their dynamics and relationships may be of particular importance in arid microtidal systems characterized by minimal nutrient input. Focusing on an arid mangrove ecosystem on the central Red Sea coast, we investigated the effect of crab bioturbation intensity (comparing natural and manipulated high levels of bioturbation intensity) on biogeochemistry and bacterial communities of mangrove sediments, and on growth performance of Avicennia marina, over a period of 16 months. Along with pronounced seasonal patterns with harsh summer conditions, in which high sediment salinity, sulfate and temperature, and absence of tidal flooding occur, sediment bacterial diversity and composition, sediment physicochemical conditions, and plant performance were significantly affected by crab bioturbation intensity. For instance, bioturbation intensity influenced components of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphate cycling, bacterial relative abundance (i.e., Bacteroidia, Proteobacteria and Rhodothermi) and their predicted functionality (i.e., chemoheterotrophy), likely resulting from enhanced metabolic activity of aerobic bacteria. The complex interactions among bacteria, animals, and sediment chemistry in this arid mangrove positively impact plant growth. We show that a comprehensive approach targeting multiple biological levels provides useful information on the ecological status of mangrove forests. IMPORTANCE Bioturbation is one of the most important processes that governs sediment biocenosis in intertidal systems. By facilitating oxygen penetration into anoxic layers, bioturbation alters the overall sediment biogeochemistry. Here, we investigate how high crab bioturbation intensity modifies the mangrove sediment bacterial community, which is the second largest component of mangrove sediment biomass and plays a significant role in major biogeochemical processes. We show that the increase in crab bioturbation intensity, by ameliorating the anoxic condition of mangrove sediment and promoting sediment bacterial diversity in favor of a beneficial bacterial microbiome, improves mangrove tree growth in arid environments. These findings have significant implications because they show how crabs, by farming the mangrove sediment, can enhance the overall capacity of the system to sustain mangrove growth, fighting climate change.

The area has been studied since 2015 by an Iranian-French archaeological mission. The archaeological excavations carried out at the Mirak N degrees 8 mound uncovered a 7 m-thick pedo-sedimentary sequence, in which two sequences corresponding to contrasting depositional environments have been observed. Sequence I, comprising alternating horizons of poorly pedogenised clayey silt intercalated with sand layers, is interpreted as an alluvial pedo-sedimentary body deposited in a wetland (floodplain) environment during cold periods, periodically interrupted by shallow sheet flooding deposits. According to the stratigraphy, OSL dates and sedimentological analyses, there is a long sedimentary hiatus before the occurrence of sequence II which corresponds to calcareous aeolian deposits typical of a desert environment. The Mirak N degrees 8 deposits were affected by several stages of incipient aridisol formation with desiccation cracks implying a gradually increasing prevalence of more arid conditions. According to the OSL data, the Mirak N degrees 8 sequence was deposited from the Late Pleistocene to the Late Holocene (52ka to 0.4ka). In this sequence, upper Palaeolithic remains were recovered at distinct levels and it can be presumed that the most recent archaeological layer is made up of palimpsests resulting from repeated human occupations. Results from various mineralogical and sedimentological analyses (XRD, FTIR, SEM, optical microscopy) show very minor differences in mineralogy throughout the record regardless of the type of depositional regime, suggesting a local, and most probably polygenic, sedimentary source. Both alluvial and aeolian accumulations were subjected after deposition to a variety of post-sedimentary pedogenesis processes indicated by pedogenic features characteristic of calcareous, gypsiferous aridisols (Bk, By), including ferruginous root coatings, evaporates and little-developed pedo-structures and horizons. Apparent differences in colour between the two sequences at Mirak N degrees 8 can be attributed to deposition in environments with varying iron contents and oxygenizing conditions, presumably related to higher groundwater levels and Fe-reducing conditions, especially for the units deposited during the late Pleistocene as opposed to the generally warm and dry conditions of the Holocene.

The planting area of cold region rice is expanded rapidly in recent years due to the high market values, also resulting in increasing water shortages and eco-environmental problems on a regional scale. Pursuing high benefits and increasing water use efficiency become more significant both for stakeholders and managers. To understand the yield variation and water-saving potential, the specific rice model-ORYZA2000 was adopted to predict the responses of rice growth/yield and water use to the various climatic and irrigation conditions in a typical cold region of northeast China. Field experiments were conducted for the Japonica rice in cold regions (JRC) during 2018 and 2019, with detailed observations on rice growth and development. The ORYZA2000 was calibrated and validated using two-year experimental data. Simulated ponded water depth, various organ development and yield fitted well with field observations. A set of recommended values of crop parameters for JRC was obtained through the systematic parametrization, showing very specific and different characters from the varieties in warmer regions. The irrigation scheduling module was modified for adapting to the various irrigation regimes. After that, the scenario simulation with 30-year different climatic data (i.e. 1990?2019) and three different irrigation regimes (i.e. traditional flood irrigation (TFI), shallow-wet irrigation (SWI) and controlled irrigation (CTI)) were conducted using the calibrated model. Status evaluation and scenario analyses indicated that the crop yield of JRC varied significantly due to relatively large fluctuations of photothermal conditions in different years. The interannual potential yield varied from 6790 to 9516 kg ha-1, with an average of 8210 kg ha-1. Evaluation on watersaving scenarios indicated that adopting SWI and CTI regimes could averagely save up to 90 mm and 140 mm (20% and 30%) of irrigation water in dry years, respectively, compared with TFI regime. Overall, the obtained set of parameters for JRC could efficiently complement the parameter database for rice modeling in cold regions; meanwhile, the yield and water-saving evaluation could provide very useful information and the basis for supporting the future JRC production and water-saving management.

Future regulated flows of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon foretell decreased areal extent of sediment and increases in riparian vegetation	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sediment connectivity; remote sensing; dams; land cover change; riparian vegetation; Colorado River	BORDERING AEOLIAN DUNEFIELDS; CONTROLLED FLOODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FINE SEDIMENT; LANDSCAPE; CORRIDOR; DYNAMICS; ARIZONA; CONNECTIVITY; VARIABILITY	Sediment transfer, or connectivity, by aeolian processes between channel-proximal and upland deposits in river valleys is important for the maintenance of river corridor biophysical characteristics. In regulated river systems, dams control the magnitude and duration of discharge. Alterations to the flow regime driven by dams that increase the inundation duration of sediment, or which drive the encroachment of vegetation into areas formerly composed of labile sediment and result in channel narrowing, may reduce sediment transfer from near-channel deposits to uplands via aeolian processes. Employing spatial methods developed by Kasprak et al (2018 Prog. Phys. Geogr.), here we use data describing the areal extent of bare (i.e. subaerially exposed and non-vegetated) sediment along 168 km of the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam in Grand Canyon, USA, in conjunction with inundation extent modeling to forecast how future flows of this highly regulated river will drive changes in the areal extent of sediment available for aeolian transport. We also compare modern bare sediment area to that which presumably would have existed under pre-dam hydrographs. Over the next two decades, the planned flow regime from Glen Canyon Dam will result in slight decreases in bare sediment area (-1%) on an annual scale. This is in contrast to pre-dam years, when unregulated low flows led to marked increases in bare sediment area as compared to the current discharge regime. Our findings also indicate that similar to 75% of bare sediment in the study reach is inundated continuously at present, owing to increased baseflows in the post-dam flow regime; consequently, any reductions in flows below modern-day low discharges have the potential to expose large areas of bare sediment. We use vegetation modeling to quantify areas susceptible to vegetation encroachment under future flows, finding that 80% of bare sediment area is suitable for colonization by invasive tamarisk under the current flow regime. Our findings imply that the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, a system marked by widespread erosion of sediment resources and encroachment of riparian vegetation in the post-dam period, is likely to continue to see decreasing bare sediment extent over the coming decades in the absence of direct intervention through flow regime modification or widespread vegetation removal.

The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) reforecast data released by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has a long-term data archive and relatively stable systematic error, which shows great potential in hydrologic applications. This paper aims to bias correct the GEFS reforecast precipitation forecasts and analyze the impact of bias-corrected ensemble precipitation forecasts on the improvement of summer streamflow prediction skill. Driven by the GEFS reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) distributed hydrological model is applied to simulate the 2000-2010 summer streamflow over the Huaihe River basin. The results show that the GEFS reforecast data generally underestimates the precipitation amount with the increasing leadtime and the streamflow simulation tends to underestimate the peak due to the spatial precipitation error. In this study, both the frequency matching method (FMM) and the analog method are applied to calibrate the GEFS reforecast ensemble precipitation forecasts. The searching criteria of the analog method has been improved based on the basin-scale areal precipitation. After bias correction, the FMM method mainly improves the forecast skill of light rain and moderate rain for the 1-8 d leadtime. By contrast, the analog method improves probabilistic precipitation forecasts and increases ensemble spread to alleviate the underdispersion of raw ensemble forecasts for the 1-8 d leadtime. The analog method can also improve spatial distributions with the downscaling information from the observed precipitation, producing better probabilistic precipitation forecasts. The streamflow prediction using bias-corrected precipitation forecasts better resembles the observed streamflow. The analog-corrected precipitation forecasts can effectively improve the streamflow simulations for the 1-5 d leadtime, with the maximum improvements at the 2-3 d leadtime. The FMM method only improves the streamflow predictions for the 2 d leadtime. For the heavy flood events caused by extreme rainstorms in the summer of 2003, the ensemble mean forecasts have limited forecast skill, but probabilistic precipitation forecasts show great potential in predicting the magnitude of extreme rainfall events. Meanwhile, the ensemble streamflow predictions using the analog-corrected precipitation forecasts have larger ensemble spread and a higher Nash coefficient of extreme streamflow. The encouraging results suggest that the reforecast ensemble dataset exhibits a great value to improve hydrometeorological predictions for operational applications.

In this paper, the precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP) and precipitation concentration index (PCI) were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variation in precipitation concentration characteristics in China from 1960 to 2015. In addition, the cross-wavelet transform was used to analyse the possible dependencies and spatial characteristics between these three precipitation concentration indices (PCD, PCP and PCI) and monsoon indices (East Asian summer monsoon index, EASMI; South Asian summer monsoon index, SASMI; and South China Sea summer monsoon index, SCSSMI) of nine river basins in China. The results show that the spatial distribution of precipitation concentration indices in China has obvious north-south and east-west variability. China's precipitation concentration indices are generally declining, with weak volatility. Among these indices, the PCD (P < 0.05) and PCI (P < 0.01) have decreased significantly at rates of - 0.005/10 year and - 0.006/10 year, respectively, while there has been no obvious decrease in the PCP. Compared with the PCD before 1978, the PCD in the rainy season after 1978 has decreased. In most areas, the rainy season is concentrated in July every year; however, the rainy season has been delayed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and has advanced mainly in the other basins. The PCI has declined since 1978, indicating a decreasing contribution of heavy precipitation to the total annual precipitation, but this change in the PCI has occurred mainly at high-value stations (PCI > 0.7), and the PCI at low-value stations has increased. Most of China's precipitation concentration indices and monsoon indices, as well as the NWRB, have small-scale (2-4 years) or medium-scale (12-15 years) oscillation periods. The oscillation periods between the precipitation concentration indices and monsoon indices in the Yangtze and Pearl River basins are more significant than those in other basins. The results of this study can help to understand the differences among the precipitation concentration characteristics in different basins in China and the intrinsic relationship between these characteristics and the summer monsoon and provide a reference for further research.

Assessing the effect of extreme heat on species requires an understanding of their adaptive capacity for mitigating physiological damage. Where long-term exposure to extreme heat in natural populations provides sufficient selection pressure, populations should exhibit signals of adaptive thermotolerance to temperature extremes. Using quantitative proteomics, we tested this idea in the widespread and commercially important tree species Eucalyptus grandis (Flooded Gum). Seedlings from six natural populations of E. grandis spanning a 2,000 km gradient were exposed to a four-day extreme heat treatment (42-24 degrees C day-night cycle) in experimental growth chambers. Populations differed in their long-term exposure to extreme heat conditions, defined both as the number of days annually >= 15 degrees C above mean annual temperature (MAT), and average number of days annually with temperature maxima >= 35 degrees C between 1960 and 1990. Long-term exposure to extreme heat conditions in the field predicted the protein-level response of E. grandis to experimental heatwaves. Relationships between long-term extreme heat exposure and protein increases were positive and linear for all combinations of extreme heat (days >= 15 degrees C above MAT, mean days with temperature maxima >= 35 degrees C annually) and expression (all differentially expressed proteins, isolated heat shock proteins, proteins involved in molecular stress responses). Although extreme climate events are typically rare (e.g., 1 day 15 degrees >= MAT per 5 years in some populations in our study), E. grandis populations sampled from across a 2,000 km range exhibit a clear capacity to increase expression of proteins involved in heat stress in response to simulated heatwave exposure. Presumably, they respond similarly under natural heatwave conditions. We show that a long-lived species with a broad environmental niche exhibits adaptive variation in protein response to temperature extremes at the population level. This implies that restoration, translocation and silvicultural programmes should consider the molecular response of source populations to climatic extremes to maximize success under future climates. Tree populations with low exposure to extreme heat conditions may be limited in their ability to respond to heatwave events, potentially limiting their adaptive capacity to withstand novel climate conditions.

J	Yu, SW; Liu, ZZ; Yang, YJ				Yu, Shiwei; Liu, Zhizhao; Yang, Yuanjian			Variation Trends of Asymmetrical Precipitable Water Vapor Outside the Tropical Cyclone Center Over the WNP and WSP Ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							VERTICAL WIND SHEAR; MICROWAVE RADIOMETER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VALIDATION; INTENSITY; SLOWDOWN	Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is one of the crucial driving forces for tropical cyclone (TC) genesis. Under the impact of global warming, TCs have changed their way to concentrate PWV from the ambient atmosphere. This study starts with the asymmetric characteristics of PWV in the TC's north and south sides using altimetry-satellite-based PWV profiles paired with 367 TCs over the western Pacific Ocean between 2008 and 2020. The results suggest that the TC-concentrated PWV has a north-leaning and south-leaning property over the western North Pacific (WNP) and western South Pacific (WSP), respectively. Moreover, it is observed that the radius of TC-concentrated PWV has broadened by 5.44% (5.83%) over the WNP (WSP) from 2008 to 2020. In contrast, the PWV gradient has decreased by 23.5% (17.5%) over the WNP (WSP). Our findings highlight that the TC-concentrated PWV can be used as an important indicator of TC responses to global warming. Global warming has deepened people's impression in tropical cyclone (TC) in the recent decades. For instance, the asymmetrical properties of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the TC's north and south sides have a sensitive response to global warming. The sea surface temperature warmed at a rate of 0.047 (0.045) & DEG;C per year over the western North (South) Pacific Ocean between 2008 and 2020, which directly results in an increase of 0.16 (0.31) kg & BULL;m-2 yr-1 in PWV. This makes it easier for TCs to concentrate more water vapor into the TC's vortex area. Statistically, the TC-concentrated PWV radius expanded by 5.44% (5.83%) or 4.0 (4.7) km & BULL;yr-1 over the western North (South) Pacific Ocean during the period 2008-2020. This finding provides another clue to TC's slowdown of translation speed and the increased TC-induced flood risk in the recent decades. The tropical cyclone (TC)-concentrated precipitable water vapor (PWV) features a north-leaning (south-leaning) property for TCs over western North Pacific (WNP) (western South Pacific (WSP)) ocean basinsThe TC-concentrated PWV area outstretches by 5.44% (5.83%) between 2008 and 2020 over WNP (WSP) ocean basinsThe spatial gradient of TC-concentrated PWV decreased by 23.5% (17.5%) between 2008 and 2020 over WNP (WSP) ocean basins	[Yu, Shiwei; Liu, Zhizhao] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanjian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing, Peoples R China	Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology	Liu, ZZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.	lszzliu@polyu.edu.hk	Liu, Zhizhao/C-7406-2012	Liu, Zhizhao/0000-0001-6822-9248; YU, Shiwei/0000-0002-8258-7241; Yang, Yuan-Jian/0000-0003-3486-6286	Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) [15205821/B-Q84W]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [1-ZVVC-ZVN6]	Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University)	The grant supports from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) projects (15205821/B-Q84W) are highly appreciated.

Yet few studies have projected flood and drought risk, owing to large uncertainties, strong non-linearities, and complex spatial-temporal dynamics. Here, we develop an integrative global risk analysis framework encapsulating future changes in flood and drought hazards as well as associated exposure and vulnerability dimensions. Flood characteristics are quantified by fitting a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to the annual flow maxima time series, while drought properties are characterized by the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI). The drivers of drought and flood risk changes at the global and regional scales are explored, and the wide cascade of uncertainties in the risk assessment is decomposed. We find a substantial increase in both flood and drought risk towards the end of the century over most of the globe, driven by compounding changes in exposure, vulnerability, and hazard. A shift from a fossil-fueled development to a sustainable one decreases the global area facing a risk doubling from 61% to 33% for flood and from 41% to 23% for drought. South America and Africa are identified as hotspot regions where a concomitant, large increase in both flood and drought risk are projected. The hazard quantification method is ubiquitously the dominant uncertainty source for drought risk changes, while the contribution of uncertainty sources for flood risk changes is highly variable in space. Plain Language Summary The number of natural hazards has accelerated sharply in the past few decades, with hydrology-related catastrophes being responsible for >50% of the total fatalities. The risk of extreme events thus warrants investigation in order to formulate efficient adaptation and risk management policies. Here, we scrutinize changes in flood and drought risk over the global land area for the end-21st-century to identify leverage points in reducing the risk. Our results show an increase in both flood and drought risks over most of the area. South America and Africa are identified as hotspot regions where a concurrent, large increase in both flood and drought risks are projected, necessitating integrated policies and practices for deliberate and effective disaster risk reduction in these regions. Our findings provide a basis for better decision-making to curb the growing impacts of the extremes and socioeconomic developments.

In this study, the hydrologic components of river discharge in the Manas River Basin were simulated using an energy balance snowmelt model called ?UEBGrid.? The model can identify surface water inputs from rain, evaporation and snow and glacial melting. The 3-h downscaled China meteorological forcing dataset and available geographic information related to basin topography, and vegetation characteristics were used to drive the model. The surface water inputs from rain, snowmelt and glacier ice melt to the river discharge during the rain-on-snow flood on 20 July 2004, and the snowmelt flood on 29 March 2011, were explored. Detailed analyses of the temporal distributions of the three surface water inputs and their contributions to river discharge during two typical floods at a 3-h scale are presented herein. The results show that (1) changes in the hydrologic components were connected to variations in either air temperature or precipitation or a combination of the two. In early spring, sharply rising temperatures likely accelerated the snow melting rate and caused the area to be prone to flooding. In late July, torrential rainfall was the most common cause of flooding. The increased rainfall in the preceding period increased the runoff rate, thereby reducing the runoff delay time by approximately one day. (2) In the flooding example, the contributions of rain, snowmelt and glacier ice melt to the river discharge varied strongly by flood type and showed obvious seasonal characteristics. The surface water inputs to the mountain front discharge were 90% sourced from snowmelt, less than 10% sourced from the glacial melt and less than 1% sourced from effective rainfall during spring flooding. In contrast, the surface water inputs were 90% sourced from effective rainfall and 10% sourced from glacial melt during the torrential rainfall flooding process. These results can help us understand the water sources and magnitude of river discharge when floods occur. Hourly surface water inputs from rain, snowmelt and glacier ice melt to river discharge that lead to hydrologic extremes (flood events) may be of value for flood predictions, climate change risk assessments and other related applications. This study can aid in preventing flood hazards and mitigating flood disasters.

We performed a suite of numerical simulations using a high-resolution setup of the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrology model for the UIB. This model takes into account the balance of both water and surface energy budgets within each grid cell and incorporates sub-grid variability of topography to represent the effects of orographic precipitation and temperature lapse rate essential for hydrological modelling in the complex Himalayan terrain. While river discharges over non-mountainous basins are known to be generally sensitive to precipitation variations, it is noted that both precipitation and snowmelt processes critically influence seasonal river discharge in the UIB during the northern summer through surface temperature and wind-speed variations. Our study found that a marginal difference in temperature forcing can create large difference in snowmelt over UIB during summer season, which in turn increases the uncertainty in the summer monsoon river discharge. This analysis highlights the equally important need for the incorporation of realistic temperature data as that of precipitation product for the better simulation of land surface processes during various seasons, especially during summer, over snow covered UIB. Further analysis of daily simulations of the VIC model during 2010-2012 indicates that low and medium intensity river discharges tend to be associated with relatively lower spread among the ensemble members, as compared to the high intensity discharges which exhibit large ensemble spread. In particular, we noted a large increase in the spread of high flow simulations over the UIB during the flood episodes in the summer of 2010, arising from uncertainties in the precipitation forcing across multiple datasets. Our results emphasize the need for improved representation of precipitation and hydrological processes over the Himalayan region in weather and climate models for better management of water resources and flood forecasting in the UIB region under a changing climate.

Disturbance legacies increase and synchronize nutrient concentrations and bacterial productivity in coastal ecosystems	ECOLOGY			English	Article						bacterioplankton; dissolved organic carbon; Florida Coastal Everglades; global climate change; long-term ecological research; nitrogen; phosphorus; wetlands	SEA-LEVEL RISE; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; FRESH-WATER; ORGANIC-MATTER; GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SOUTHERN EVERGLADES; SALTWATER INTRUSION; PHOSPHORUS; FLORIDA; WETLAND	Long-term ecological research can resolve effects of disturbance on ecosystem dynamics by capturing the scale of disturbance and interactions with environmental changes. To quantify how disturbances interact with long-term directional changes (sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), we studied 17 yr of monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity across freshwater-to-marine estuary gradients exposed to multiple disturbance events (e.g., droughts, fire, hurricanes, and low-temperature anomalies) and long-term increases in water levels. By studying two neighboring drainages that differ in hydrologic connectivity, we additionally tested how disturbance legacies are shaped by hydrologic connectivity. We predicted that disturbance events would interact with long-term increases in water levels in freshwater and marine ecosystems to increase spatiotemporal similarity (i.e., synchrony) of organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activities. Wetlands along the larger, deeper, and tidally influenced Shark River Slough (SRS) drainage had higher and more variable DOC, TN, and TP concentrations than wetlands along the smaller, shallower, tidally restricted Taylor River Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph) drainage. Along SRS, DOC concentrations declined with proximity to coast, and increased in magnitude and variability following drought and flooding in 2015 and a hurricane in 2017. Along TS/Ph, DOC concentrations varied by site (higher in marine than freshwater wetlands) but not year. In both drainages, increases in TN from upstream freshwater marshes occurred following fire in 2008 and droughts in 2010 and 2015, whereas downstream increases in TP occurred with coastal storm surge from hurricanes in 2005 and 2017. Decreases in DOC:TN and DOC:TP were explained by increased TN and TP. Increases in bacterioplankton productivity occurred throughout both drainages following low-temperature events (2010 and 2011) and a hurricane (2017). Long-term TN and TP concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity were correlated (r > 0.5) across a range of sampling distances (1-50 km), indicating spatiotemporal synchrony. DOC concentrations were not synchronized across space or time. Our study advances disturbance ecology theory by illustrating how disturbance events interact with long-term environmental changes and hydrologic connectivity to determine the magnitude and extent of disturbance legacies. Understanding disturbance legacies will enhance prediction and enable more effective management of rapidly changing ecosystems.

It involved the building of a rain-spray system simulator and worktops to support the experimental units. Three green roof modular-tray systems were studied, M-4L, M-17L and F-17L, with a mix of succulent plant species. The volume and delay of total runoff were sampled for both dry and wet soil-moisture stages for a simulated rainstorm of 155 mm/h and duration of 7 min, which approaches the value of the design rainfall of 10-year return-period and an observed rainfall event that caused flooding in 2011 in the area where the experiments took place. These results were compared to three bare-soil similar experimental units and with a control unit consisting of a corrugated fibre-cement roof sheet. In addition, classic rainfall runoff parameterization, also important for catchment analysis, such as the rational coefficient method (C) and Curve Number (CN) were also applied. The results showed to be consistent. Overall, module F-17L presented the best performance with regard to both water retention and delay of total runoff. The average percentage of retention, considering all module types, was 58% of the total induced water volume, and the average delay for total runoff was approximately 12 min. In some tests, for the wet soil stage, the bare soil units performed better than the vegetated units. Soil moisture analysis revealed that considering the same period of time, the bare soil units lost more water through evaporation than the vegetated units through evapotranspiration. The average values of C for vegetated units for the wet and dry soil stages were equal to 0.66 and 0.27, respectively. The CN values were high, ranging from 88 to 97. Although fairly new on the market in Rio de Janeiro, modular-tray green roof systems are easy to build and hydrologically effective, mainly in the dry soil stages, performing as well as other extensive green roof systems. The values obtained for C and CN may be useful for the modelling of catchment rainfall and runoff especially for scenarios involving green roofs, as well as for establishing regulatory benchmarks towards more resilient and sustainable cities.

As the main factor controlling the topographic evolution of the channel, the water and sediment-supply conditions of the Yellow River have undergone significant changes since the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) in 2002 by the joint operation of large reservoirs. Hence, it is necessary to conduct systematic research and evaluation on how the regulation scheme influences the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel. This study used the elevation data of 79 fixed profiles collected between 1992 and 2012 from the channel downstream from Gaocun in the Yellow River to establish a digital elevation model. The elevation model was used to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of channel scouring and deposition in the study area and to determine the main controlling factors. The results show that on an inter-annual scale, the channel scouring and deposition pattern began to change from substantial deposition to rapid erosion after 2002. On a seasonal scale, the overall characteristic was erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season; however, the erosion rate in the flood season increased and the deposition rate in the dry season decreased after 2002. From the spatial perspective, the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002. The WSRS altered the regimes of water and sediment of the river and therefore dominated scouring and deposition in the downstream channel. Since the implementation of the WSRS, continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41% of coarse-grained sediments for the Yellow River, and formed an important source of sediments entering the sea. However, because of the formation of an armor layer of coarse-grained sediments on the downstream riverbed surface due to continuous scouring after the implementation of the WSRS, the erosion flux of the river channel in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has shown a significant decrease since 2005. This study provides a typical case study for the response of the topographic evolution of rivers to water and sediment changes under the influence of intense human activities.

J	Liu, H; Zheng, L; Jiang, L; Liao, MW				Liu, Hai; Zheng, Liang; Jiang, Liang; Liao, Mingwei			Forty-year water body changes in Poyang Lake and the ecological impacts based on Landsat and HJ-1 A/B observations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Dense long time series data; Poyang Lake; Dynamic changes; Influencing factors; Ecological impact	YANGTZE-RIVER; SEDIMENT DISCHARGE; FLOOD FREQUENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEVEL; SEA; DAM	With global warming and aggravation due to human activities, many lakes on Earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems, such as shrinking areas and declining water quality. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. The ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention. It is necessary to use long-term frequent satellite observations to investigate the Poyang Lake due to its high-frequency fluctuations characteristics. However, most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time, which cannot reflect the long-term change to the Poyang Lake water, no satellite mission currently fits such requirements. Based on HJ-1A/B and Landsat data from 1989 to 2018, the dynamic changes in water quantity in Poyang Lake are monitored in this paper, and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed. The results show that in terms of the water area change trend, on the annual scale, the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends. The water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068.33 km(2) and smallest in 2014 at 899.68 km(2); the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25,810 million m(3) and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m(3). On the monthly scale, the water area was the smallest in January, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from January to July; subsequently, a decreasing trend was observed from August to January. The water volume was smallest in February, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from February to July; then, a decreasing trend was observed from August to February. The water volume of Poyang Lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation, and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0.603 (P < 0.05). In summer, the water volume is affected by the water level in the Yangtze River; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period, which are also important factors affecting the water volume change. In terms of the impact of water volume on ecology, the relationship between water volume and NH3-N concentration is obvious, with a correlation coefficient of - 0.679 (P < 0.01). A large water volume will increase the lake water level, reduce the habitats for migratory birds, and provide food to fewer migratory birds.

This work presents the geochemical characteristics of dissolved Sr and hydrochemistry, and estimates chemical weathering rate together with elemental Sr flux during the flood season of the Mun River, the largest tributary of Mekong River. Hydrochemistry analysis indicates the dominance of Cl- and HCO3- for major anions with the average of 34.6 and 43.0 mg/L, respectively, and Na+ and Ca2+ together dominated the cationic composition with the average of 22.9 and 10.5 mg/L, respectively. The ion concentrations during flood season were lower than that in dry season, implying tremendous river runoff due to extreme rainfall. The dissolved Sr ranges 6.1-237.5 mu g/L with higher contents in the upper Mun. Sr contents in flood season are lower and less fluctuated than that in dry season, whereas the divergence between up and downstream becomes larger. Sr-87/Sr-86 ranges 0.7100-0.7597, slightly higher than global average. Elemental molar ratio analysis partly corroborates the inference from correlation analysis, but Sr-87/Sr-86 does not correlate with Na/Ca, indicating additional influence except for the weathering of evaporites and silicates. Comparing to regional wastewater and rainwater, the lower reaches exhibits superimposed impact of agricultural inputs on weathering to dissolved loads, especially in downstream with more tributary convergence. Extreme rainfall during flood season and extensive agricultural production activities may interfere in altering riverine solutes. Silicate weathering rate and CO2 consumption rate are calculated as well as the yearly Sr-87 in excess to the Mekong River and finally to the Pacific Ocean with a Sr flux of 1.98 x 10(3) tons/year, indicating significant influence on seawater strontium isotope evolution in the long run. Together with tropical climate and high-intensity precipitation, the accelerated chemical weathering process seems inevitable. Therefore, the impact of agricultural interference in the pan-Mekong River basin needs more systematic and multi-angle research to provide a comprehensive insight on better watershed management under tropical climatic conditions.

Results have shown that the midlatitude responses are dominated by dynamic effects. Poleward of around 60 degrees N, the dynamic and thermodynamic effects cancel each other, resulting in relatively small responses. The response uncertainty can be characterized by leading uncertainty modes, with the responses over the Pacific and Atlantic projecting onto the northeastward extension and equatorward shift mode, respectively. In addition, the responses seem to be mean state-dependent: under the same forcing, models with more poleward-located climatological ARs tend to show stronger equatorward shifts over the Atlantic; over the Pacific, models with more westward-located climatological AR core tend to show stronger northeastward extensions. These relationships highlight the importance of improving the AR climatology representation on reducing the response uncertainty to Arctic sea ice loss. Plain Language Summary It has been hypothesized that Arctic sea ice loss can influence midlatitude weather extremes. Atmospheric rivers (ARs), a type of extreme weather, are characterized by intense water vapor transport in the atmosphere. When these "rivers" in the sky make landfall and encounter mountain barriers, they can produce torrential rainfall and even cause floods. However, how Arctic sea ice loss may influence ARs remains largely unknown. Using data from climate model simulations driven by Arctic sea ice loss, we found that sea ice loss can cause ARs to occur at lower latitude regions over the Atlantic. Over the Pacific, ARs will occur more often at regions closer to the North American west coast. Although the above-mentioned responses are quite consistent across models, model-to-model differences in the responses exist. We further found that such inter-model differences in the responses are related to how well models simulate the AR climatology. Therefore, improving the model's ability to capture the AR characteristics in the present climate can potentially help us make better predictions on how ARs will change under future Arctic sea ice loss. Key Points Midlatitude AR response to Arctic sea ice loss dominated by the effects driven by the changes in the westerly jet AR response to sea ice loss characterized by northeastward extension over the Pacific and equatorward shift over the Atlantic The responses in ARs are related to climatological AR characteristics	[Ma, Weiming; Chen, Gang; Alviz, Noah] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Peings, Yannick] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA	University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Irvine	Ma, WM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.	mawei@atmos.ucla.edu	Chen, Gang/CAA-8593-2022	Chen, Gang/0000-0003-4934-1909; Alviz, Noah/0000-0002-6551-7647	National Science Foundation; NASA [80NSSC21K1522]; Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0019407]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0019407] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)	National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))	The authors thank Rosie Eade at Met Office for the use of the HadGEM3 data, Lantao Sun at Colorado State University for the use of the CESM2 data and Guillaume Gastineau at Institut Pierre Simon Laplace for the use of the IPSL-CM6A data.

A way forward is to optimally combine the global network of earth system observations with advanced numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to generate consistent spatio-temporal maps of land, ocean, and atmospheric variables of interest, which is known as a reanalysis. While the current generation of NWP models output runoff at each grid cell, they currently do not produce river discharge at catchment scales directly and thus have limited utility in hydrological applications such as flood and drought monitoring and forecasting. This is overcome in the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; http://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 28 June 2020) by coupling surface and sub-surface runoff from the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) land surface model used within ECMWF's latest global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) with the LISFLOOD hydrological and channel routing model. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the GloFAS-ERA5 global river discharge reanalysis dataset launched on 5 November 2019 (version 2.1 release). The river discharge reanalysis is a global gridded dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degrees at a daily time step. An innovative feature is that it is produced in an operational environment so is available to users from 1 January 1979 until near real time (2 to 5 d behind real time). The reanalysis was evaluated against a global network of 1801 daily river discharge observation stations. Results found that the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis was skilful against a mean flow benchmark in 86% of catchments according to the modified Kling-Gupta efficiency skill score, although the strength of skill varied considerably with location. The global median Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.61 with an interquartile range of 0.44 to 0.74. The long-term and operational nature of the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides a valuable dataset to the user community for applications ranging from monitoring global flood and drought conditions to the identification of hydroclimatic variability and change and as raw input for post-processing and machine learning methods that can add further value.

Quantifying drought's influence on moist soil seed vegetation in California's Central Valley through remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Central Valley; drought; machine learning; managed wetland; moist soil management; remote sensing; waterfowl food resources	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LAND-COVER; INDEXES; ACCURACY; WATER; AREA	California's Central Valley, USA is a critical component of the Pacific Flyway despite loss of more than 90% of its wetlands. Moist soil seed (MSS) wetland plants are now produced by mimicking seasonal flooding in managed wetlands to provide an essential food resource for waterfowl. Managers need MSS plant area and productivity estimates to support waterfowl conservation, yet this remains unknown at the landscape scale. Also the effects of recent drought on MSS plants have not been quantified. We generated Landsat-derived estimates of extents and productivity (seed yield or its proxy, the green chlorophyll index) of major MSS plants including watergrass (Echinochloa crusgalli) and smartweed (Polygonumspp.) (WGSW), and swamp timothy (Crypsis schoenoides) (ST) in all Central Valley managed wetlands from 2007 to 2017. We tested the effects of water year, land ownership and region on plant area and productivity with a multifactor nested analysis of variance. For the San Joaquin Valley, we explored the association between water year and water supply, and we developed metrics to support management decisions. MSS plant area maps were based on a support vector machine classification of Landsat phenology metrics (2017 map overall accuracy: 89%). ST productivity maps were created with a linear regression model of seed yield (n = 68,R-2 = 0.53, normalized RMSE = 10.5%). The Central Valley-wide estimated area for ST in 2017 was 32,369 ha (29,845-34,893 ha 95% CI), and 13,012 ha (11,628-14,396 ha) for WGSW. Mean ST seed yield ranged from 577 kg/ha in the Delta Basin to 365 kg/ha in the San Joaquin Basin. WGSW area and ST seed yield decreased while ST area increased in critical drought years compared to normal water years (Scheffe's test,P < 0.05). Greatest ST area increases occurred in the Sacramento Valley (similar to 75%). Voluntary water deliveries increased in normal water years, and ST seed yield increased with water supply.Zscores of ST seed yield can be used to evaluate wetland performance and aid resource allocation decisions. Updated maps will support habitat monitoring, conservation planning and water management in future years, which are likely to face greater uncertainty in water availability with climate change.

The most important difference between the three methods is the estimation of flood vulnerability for Progreso. The first method, proposed by Mexico's National Center for the Prevention of Disasters (CENAPRED) and used by the Mexican government is based mostly on economic asset (household goods) values and flood impacts. The second (CENAPREDv2) and third (FRI) methods are proposals for assessing risk that include 17 socioeconomic indicators. The former includes economic asset values, as is the case for CENAPRED, while the latter does not. The main results of this study show that the modeled 'Norte' event flooded 25% of Progreso's city blocks, with an estimated economic flood risk of $USD 16,266 (CENAPRED) and $USD 223,779 (CENAPREDv2), and flood damage of $USD 48,848 and $USD 671,918, respectively. When calculating flood risk (FRI) and flood damage (FRI_FD) without monetary terms, the risk categories along the back-barrier behind Progreso varied spatially from 'very low' to 'high', while areas along the coastal side presented a 'low' and 'very low' risk. These categories increased for the flood damage because the exceedance probability of the flood was not considered as it was for flood risk in the three methodologies. Therefore, flood damage provides the losses caused by a given flood event without considering how probable that loss may be. In conclusion, this study proposes that the selection of the applied method depends on the main objectives and specific interests when assessing flood risk. For instance, if economic damage is the main concern, then the CENAPRED method should be used as it identifies where the larger economic impacts could occur; when a socioeconomic approach is needed then the FRI should be applied, but if both economic damage and socioeconomic aspects are needed, the CENAPREDv2 is recommended. Besides considering economic aspects, the FRI method also includes social variables that can help to map the most vulnerable population in terms of mobility, education, communication access and others. Therefore, the proposed FRI method is very relevant for disaster risk managers and other stakeholders interested in disaster risk reduction.

Dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought. Dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, such as geology, soil type, and altitude. In this study, appropriate areas of dam site selection for water management were identified using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and multi-criteria decision making techniques. In addition, the proposed method of site suitability was evaluated by comparing it with the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A new validation method to evaluate the accuracy of AHP and fuzzy logic according to the preselected location of a darn was previously suggested in the study area (Bekhme darn) by the local government. Remote sensing data (Landsat imageries and ASTER DEM) and field/reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors needed to produce a suitability map for construction. The criteria considered were geological formation, soil type, fault line, tectonic line, altitude, slope, rainfall data (2000-2011), water discharge, land use/cover, road network, and material used for dam construction. Two mathematical models, namely, AHP and fuzzy logic, were applied in this study. The best model was selected by using location and cluster-based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site (i.e., Bekhme dam). Results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than AHP. In terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified, the AHP model determined 13,446,900 m(2) as a highly suitable area, whereas the fuzzy model identified 3,409,200 m(2) from the total area of 69,347,700 m(2). Finally, this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area. The total water capacities of proposed Dam 1, Dam 2, Dam 3, and Dam 4 are about 81.5, 239.3, 374.6, and 646.5 million m(3), respectively, when the dam height is 60 m. The proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications. The finding reveals that AHP model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area, whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas.

J	Prakash, V; Mishra, V				Prakash, Ved; Mishra, Vimal			Soil Moisture and Streamflow Data Assimilation for Streamflow Prediction in the Narmada River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrology; Hydrologic models; Model errors; Data assimilation	UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; INITIAL CONDITION; DATA SET; ENSEMBLE; FLOOD; MODEL; RAINFALL; FORECAST; SURFACE; INDIA	An accurate streamflow forecast is vital for flood prediction and early warning systems. Notwithstanding the rising frequency and intensity of floods during the summer monsoon season in India, efforts to examine the utility of data assimilation (DA) for streamflow prediction remain limited. We examine soil moisture and streamflow DA to improve streamflow simulations in the Narmada River basin, considered a testbed. Data assimilation was performed using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at four gauge stations in the basin. First, we used the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate the satellite soil moisture from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESACCI) to the initial state of the VIC model. We examined the usefulness of observed streamflow from the India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS) to improve the initial hydrological conditions of the VIC model in the streamflow DA during the summer monsoon (June-September) season from 1980 to 2018. The assimilation of ESA-CCI soil moisture showed less improvement in percent error reduction (PER) and efficiency index (EFF) (less than 2%) than the streamflow DA at all of the four gauge locations in the Narmada basin. On the other hand, the streamflow DA showed a significant improvement in PER and EFF (more than 10%) at all the gauge stations for both mean and high -flow conditions. Streamflow data assimilation improved errors in the magnitude and timing for the major floods in 1994 and 2013. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: India is considerably affected by floods during the summer monsoon. Floods have increased and are projected to become more frequent under the warming climate. Flood prediction and early warning systems are essential in reducing their impacts and exposure. In the present study, we are interested in examining the role of soil moisture and streamflow data assimilation on flood prediction in the Narmada River basin. Our results show that streamflow data assimilation is more effective in reducing errors and bias in streamflow prediction than soil moisture data assimilation. The hydrologic framework used for the Narmada basin can be extended and evaluated to other flood-prone basins in India.

Bison influences on composition and diversity of riparian plant communities in Yellowstone National Park	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						American bison; grazing impacts; herbivory; large herbivore disturbance; plant diversity; riparian ecosystems; streambank disturbance; ungulate impacts; Yellowstone National Park	WILD UNGULATE; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS; PREHISTORIC BISON; ELK; HERBIVORY; PREDATION; CATTLE; COTTONWOOD; RECOVERY; IMPACTS	Riparian zones are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the Intermountain West, USA, and provide valuable ecosystem services, including high rates of biotic productivity, nutrient processing, and carbon storage. Thus, their sustainability is a high priority for land managers. Large ungulates affect composition and structure of riparian/stream ecosystems through herbivory and physical effects, via trailing and trampling. Bison (Bison bison) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) have been characterized as "ecosystem engineers " because of their demonstrated effects on phenology, aboveground productivity of grasses, and woody vegetation structure. Bison have greatly increased in numbers during the last two decades and spend large periods of time in the broad open floodplains of the Northern Range of the Park, where they are hypothesized to have multiple effects on plant species composition and diversity. We sampled indicators of bison use as well as riparian vegetation composition, diversity, and structure along eight headwater streams within YNP's Northern Range. Total fecal density ranged from 333 to 1833 fecal chips and/or piles/ha, stubble heights ranged from 7 to 49 cm, and streambank disturbance ranged from 9% to 62%. High levels of bison use were positively correlated with exotic species dominance and negatively correlated with species richness, native species diversity, willow (Salix spp.) cover, and wetland species dominance. At three sites, the intensity of bison use exceeded recommended utilization thresholds to avoid degradation of streams and riparian zones on public lands. The influences of large herbivores, principally bison, on vegetation composition and structure suggest the cumulative effects of the current densities on the Northern Range are contributing to biotic impoverishment, representing the loss of ecosystem services that are provided by native riparian plant communities. In addition, contemporary levels of bison use may be exacerbating climate change effects as observed through ungulate-related shifts in composition toward plant assemblages adapted to warmer and drier conditions. However, the resilience of native riparian vegetation suggests that sites currently heavily utilized by bison would have the potential for recovery with a reduction in pressure by this herbivore.

Considering climate change and the recent emergence of other vector borne diseases in Europe, historical insight into the relationship between malaria and environmental factors in northern Europe is needed. This article describes malaria epidemiology in late-nineteenth century Denmark. Methods: We described the seasonality and spatial patterns of malaria, and the relationship of the disease with environmental factors such as soil types, clay content and elevation for the period 1862-1914. We studied demographic and seasonal patterns and malaria mortality in the high-morbidity period of 1862-1880. Finally, we studied the relationship between malaria seasonality and temperature and precipitation using a Spearman correlation test. Results: We found that the highest incidence occurred in eastern Denmark. Lolland-Falster medical region experienced the highest incidence (14.5 cases per 1000 pop.) and Bornholm medical region experienced the lowest incidence (0.57 cases per 1000 pop.). Areas with high malaria incidence also had high soil clay content, high agricultural production, and Lolland-Falster furthermore has a low elevation. Malaria incidence typically peaked in May and was associated with high temperatures in July and August of the previous year but not with precipitation. The case fatality rate was 0.17%, and the disease affected both sexes and all age groups except for infants. In 1873, a large epidemic occurred following flooding from a storm surge in November 1872. Conclusions: Malaria gradually declined in Denmark during our study period and had essentially disappeared by 1900. The high adult and low child morbidity in 1862-1880 indicates that malaria was not highly endemic in this period, as malaria is most frequent among children in highly endemic areas today.The association of high malaria incidence in spring with warmer temperatures in the previous summer suggests that transmission took place in the previous summers. The close geographical connection between malaria and soil types, agricultural production and elevation suggests that these factors are detrimental to sustain endemic malaria. Our findings of a close connection between malaria and environmental factors such as climate and geography provides insights to address potential reintroduction of malaria in temperate climates.

Investigation of basin characteristics: Implications for sub-basin-level vulnerability to flood peak generation	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood vulnerability; Hydrological modeling; Indicator-based method; GIS; Flood peak	FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; CURVE NUMBER METHOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; KASHMIR VALLEY; NEURAL-NETWORK; JHELUM BASIN; RUNOFF; RIVER	The potential of the sub-basins to generate peak flood plays crucial role in assessing the probable degree of damage to various exposures in hazard condition. In this study, a semi-distributed event-based hydrological model and theoretical indicator-based framework were integrated to evaluate the vulnerability of sub-basins to generate peak flood using the Geographical Information System (GIS). The flood peak discharge of each sub-basin corresponding to the 2014 extreme flood of the Jhelum river was related with different sub-basins characteristics (terrain, hydrological, land use, and soil) to assess vulnerability of flood peak which can be categorized into the class of vulnerability called "physical vulnerability". The determined characteristics of the sub-basins from the configured hydrological model were treated as "vulnerability indicators". The calibrated (2014) and validated (1992 and 1997) hydrological model showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.96 and (0.97, 0.98), respectively, at upstream gauging station Sangam against optimized curve number (CN) scaling factor of 0.98. However, the NSE values of 0.84 and 0.78 are obtained at the other two gauging stations, i.e., RamMunshi Bagh and Asham in the downstream after the calibration process at Sangam in the upstream. The Anantnag and Kulgam districts, exhibiting multiple sub-basins contributing to the Sangam gauging station, are falling into a high vulnerable category located in the Jhelum basin's southeastern part, Greater Himalayan Range. It was also revealed that sub-basins at the upstream of the Jhelum basin are more vulnerable compared to downstream area, where sub-basin W810, Anantnag district (Greater Himalaya), draining at Sangam gauging site is the most vulnerable. Further, hydrological characteristics control the most vulnerable sub-basin peak discharge rather than other characteristics such as terrain, soil, or land use. Outcomes of the study will be helpful in prioritizing the flood mitigation planning not only with respect to the hydrological boundary (sub-basin level) but also with administrative district boundaries. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any flood-prone river basin.

Due to the shortage of land resources in metropolitan areas, it is necessary to understand how to utilize the limited UGI area to maximize the waterlogging mitigation function. Less attention, however, has been paid to investigating the threshold level of waterlogging mitigation capacity. Additionally, various studies mainly focused on the individual effects of UGI factors on waterlogging but neglected the interactive effects between these factors. To overcome this limitation, two waterlogging high-risk coastal cities-Guangzhou and Shenzhen, are selected to examine the effectiveness and stability of UGI in alleviating urban waterlogging. The results indicate that the impact of green infrastructure on urban waterlogging largely depends on its area and biophysical parameter. Healthier or denser vegetation (superior ecological environment) can more effectively intercept and store rainwater runoff. This suggests that while increasing the area of UGI, more attention should be paid to the biophysical parameter of vegetation. Hence, the mitigation effect of green infrastructure would be improved from the "size" and "health". The interaction of composition and spatial configuration greatly enhances their individual effects on waterlogging. This result underscores the importance of the interactive enhancement effect between UGI composition and spatial configuration. Therefore, it is particularly important to optimize the UGI composition and spatial pattern under limited land resource conditions. Lastly, the effect of green infrastructure on waterlogging presents a threshold phenomenon. The excessive area proportions of UGI within the watershed unit or an oversized UGI patch may lead to a waste of its mitigation effect. Therefore, the area proportion of UGI and its mitigation effect should be considered comprehensively when planning UGI. It is recommended to control the proportion of green infrastructure at the watershed scale (24.4% and 72.1% for Guangzhou and Shenzhen) as well as the area of green infrastructure patches (1.9 ha and 2.8 ha for Guangzhou and Shenzhen) within the threshold level to maximize its mitigation effect. Given the growing concerns of global warming and continued rapid urbanization, these findings provide practical urban waterlogging prevention strategies toward practical implementations.

These lakes generally grow, coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This study assesses such hazards of Lower Barun Lake located near Mount Everest, Nepal. We model a series of scenarios, including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential GLOFs from the lake. To evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping, we characterize the initial avalanche-induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami-like events. Further, we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and GLOF events along the Barun-Arun river valley. Special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements. To estimate potential impacts at each location, two extreme-magnitude, two high-magnitude, two moderate-magnitude, and two low-magnitude GLOFs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake. As with most hydrological processes, the magnitude and frequency of GLOFs from Lower Barun Lake have an inverse, albeit uncertain, relationship, but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events' magnitude. The flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley. The extreme-magnitude and high-magnitude GLOF cases, where the moraine is incised, have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements. The moderate-magnitude and low-magnitude GLOFs, while the most frequent type, have limited volume and peak discharge, causing less impact downstream. Our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake, and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods.

J	Gao, L; Long, H; Tamura, T; Hou, YD; Shen, J				Gao, Lei; Long, Hao; Tamura, Toru; Hou, Yandong; Shen, Ji			A ∼130 ka terrestrial-marine interaction sedimentary history of the northern Jiangsu coastal plain in China	MARINE GEOLOGY			English	Article						Jiangsu coastal plain; Luminescence dating; Chronostratigraphy; Sedimentary history; Marine transgression	CHANGJIANG YANGTZE-RIVER; SOUTHERN YELLOW SEA; SOUTHWESTERN BOHAI BAY; LATE PLEISTOCENE; EAST CHINA; TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; MEDITERRANEAN COAST; HOLOCENE CHENIERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Coastal deposits are ideal archives to decipher the history of terrestrial-marine interactions in response to sea-level changes. Over the last decades, numerous investigations have been implemented to uncover the stratigraphic framework and the paleoenvironment evolution of the Jiangsu coastal plain (JCP), China. However, there have been limited studies on the sedimentary history over the glacial-interglacial timescales because of the lack of reliable chronostratigraphy. Here, we selected a 30-m-long sediment core in the northern JCP for luminescence dating, and carried out comprehensive sedimentological and paleontological analyses to ascertain the sedimentary history. Multiple luminescence dating techniques, including quartz optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) and feldspar (polymineral) post-infrared (IR) IR stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating, were applied to determine the chronology of the sediment core. The obtained chronostratigraphy of core JCP01 spanning similar to 130 ka reveals that terrestrial deposition occurred in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, MIS 4-2 and the late stage of MIS 1. In contrast, marine influenced deposition is identified in MIS 5e and early MIS 1. The terrestrial interval of core JCP01 mainly consists of stiff clay and floodplain facies occurring at depths of 30-24 m, 12-5 m and 2-1 m, formed in relation to sea-level lowstands; whereas marine-influenced sediments at depths of 24-12 m and 5-2 m correspond to sea-level highstands, respectively. Our results highlight two sets of marine influenced sedimentary stratigraphy (T1, T2) dated to similar to 7 ka and around 130-120 ka, but no obvious MIS 3 transgression recorded in this core. In general, the conclusion is consistent with previous studies in East Asia and beyond, but not with previous work in this region that relied on radiocarbon dating. This suggests that re-dating with luminescence techniques is required for deposits correlated with the MIS 3 transgression in the northern JCP. Our reconstructed terrestrial-marine alternation sedimentary history of the northern JCP also shows a strong linkage with changes in the relative sea-level over the glacial-interglacial cycles.

Variability and Transitions in Precipitation Extremes in the Midwest United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Extreme events; Precipitation; Climate variability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHT; INTENSIFICATION; PROJECTIONS; IMPACTS; TRENDS; ONSET; SOIL	Monthly to seasonal precipitation extremes, both flood and drought, are important components of regional climates worldwide, and are the subjects of numerous investigations. However, variability in and transition between precipitation extremes, and associated impacts are the subject of far fewer studies. Recent such events in the Midwest region of the United States, such as the 2011-12 flood to drought transition in the upper Mississippi River basin and the flood to drought transition experienced in parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois in 2019, have sparked concerns of increased variability and rapid transitions between precipitation extremes and compounded economic and environmental impacts. In response to these concerns, this study focuses on characterizing variability and change in Midwest precipitation extremes and transitions between extremes over the last 70 years. Overall we find that the Midwest as a region has gotten wetter over the last seven decades, and that in general the annual maximum and median wetness, defined using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), have increased at a larger magnitude than the annual minimum. We find large areas of the southern Midwest have experienced a significant increase in the annual SPI range and associated magnitude of transition between annual maximum and minimum SPI. We additionally find wet to dry transitions between extremes have largely increased in speed (i.e., less time between extremes), while long-term changes in transition frequency are more regional within the Midwest. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe U.S. Midwest has experienced several rapid transitions in precipitation extremes over the past decade. These events, such as the 2012-13 drought to flood transition, have sparked concerns of more frequent, rapid swings in precipitation extremes. We use a 69-yr daily precipitation record to document transitions in precipitation extremes across the Midwest. We find that since the 1950s the Midwest has gotten wetter, but annual wet extremes have increased at a much larger rate than annual dry extremes. Furthermore, we find the area from eastern Missouri to western Ohio has experienced more frequent, more rapid flood to drought transitions in recent decades. This provides evidence of increased precipitation variability in this region, and associated rapid transitions between extremes.

This action is related to the global warning about the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), like CO2, as reported by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) . One of the most hazardous issue related to environmental risk in machining process is the application of metalworking fluids (MWFs), especially in grinding process in which MWFs are pivotal to control high generation of heat and avoid workpiece surface burns and microstructural changes. The minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) was broadly reported in the literature as a potential alternative lubri-cooling technique to the conventional technique (flood F). However, the main drawback of MQL grinding is related to high generation of clogging phenomenon produced by the chips lodged on the grinding wheel active surface (GWAS) due to the low oil volume and consequently the low lubricating and cooling action. In order to propose improvements on MQL technique, increase its efficiency and viability and develop a potential greener lubri-cooling technique, this work aims to propose and evaluate the application of hybrid HMQL + WCJ technique combined oil and water at 1:5 oil-water in the Al2O3 grinding process of AISI 4340 steel. This technique was compared to flood F and the pure PMQL + WCJ (pure oil) techniques. Both MQL techniques (hybrid and pure) employed at 30, 60 and 120 mL/h. The PMQL + WCJ technique produced the worst results irrespective of the flow rate. The HMQL + WCJ at 120 mL/h (highest flow rate) presented similar performance to the F technique in terms of surface roughness, microhardness, clogging behavior on GWAS, workpiece form deviation, grinding power, generation of CO2 during the process and acoustic emission (AE) and outperformance in terms of G ratio. This indicates the eco-efficient potential to be widely employed in manufacturing industry and mitigate the environmental impact and carbon footprint of hybrid MQL + WCJ technique.

In this study, a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) was developed to identify the most suitable areas in the inner part of the Gulf of Thailand (InnerGoT) for green mussel culture. Satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and hydrodynamic model outputs for sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, maximum water current (MWC), and bathymetry between 2018 and 2019 were used as input to the SASSM. The results show that suitability scores in mussel aquaculture areas were lowest (1-3) during the Southwest (SW) monsoon, rainy season (July-August), and highest (6-7) during the Northeast (NE) monsoon, cold season (November-December). Moderate suitability scores (4-5) were obtained during the monsoon transition from the NE monsoon to the SW monsoon, summer (April-May). The study area was further divided into three zones: the western, central, and eastern regions. The western and eastern parts showed high suitability scores (5-7) while the central zone exhibited low suitability scores (2-4). The model results show a similar pattern to the actual mussel production in the study area. Seasonal events (i.e., flood and dry seasons) were incorporated into the model to examine the seasonal effects on the suitable mussel aquaculture areas. The suitability scores during the SW monsoon in 2018 were more sensitive to changes in SST and salinity relative to 2019. The higher freshwater discharge and lower temperature in 2018 relative to 2019 resulted in the accrual of suitable aquaculture areas. This pattern is consistent with the productions of the green mussel, where higher production was recorded in 2018 (2002.5 t) than in 2019 (410.8 t). However, correlations among atmospheric (air temperature, rainfall, and wind) and oceanographic factors (SST and MWC) were significant in the western and central regions, suggesting that the suitability of green mussel aquaculture in these regions is vulnerable to environmental disturbances. Thus, the SASSM can be a powerful tool in providing useful information on spatial management for marine aquaculture in environmentally-dynamic coastal systems.

J	Mouri, G				Mouri, Goro			Reproduction of sediment deposition and prediction of <SUP>137</SUP>Cs concentration in the major urban rivers of Tokyo	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARTICLE-SIZE; DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; SELECTIVE SORPTION; WATER EROSION; SEWAGE SYSTEM; FUKUSHIMA; MODEL	Radioactive caesium-137 (Cs-137) can be used as a tracer to infer sediment dynamics due not only to its long radioactive half-life but also its affinity for fine sediment. A novel advanced interpolation assessment was conducted to examine radionuclide activity in terraced land covered with volcanic ash soil in Tokyo, Japan, which had a time-dependent input function and incorporated the effects of mixed-sediment particle dynamic behaviour on radioactive decay. In addition, transport parameters derived from Chernobyl measurements were applied as predictors of the long-term contamination of the cardinal urban rivers by the fallout from the Tokyo Electric Power Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident in 2011. The behaviour of suspended sediment substances, incorporating the effects of deposition and pickup, was assessed using a mixed-sediment particle dynamics model. The concentrations of Cs-137 adsorbed on fine sediment particles of each size fraction were determined. Removal of Cs-137 from the cardinal urban river channel had significant effects on both long-term decline, including extreme flash flood events, and the dynamic and time-dependent behaviours of interspersed Cs-137 and sediment activity. A novel advanced interpolation assessment method was used to examine radionuclide activity in terraced land covered with volcanic ash soil in Tokyo, Japan. The assessment procedure has a time-dependent input function and incorporates the effects of mixed-sediment particle dynamics on this time dependence. The results indicated that sediment and Cs-137 concentrations could decline more rapidly than observed in the Fukushima and Chernobyl regions. This rate of decrease depended on terraces covered with volcanic ash soil, which incorporated the effects of fine sediment behaviour for particle adsorption. In addition, comparatively large impacts were observed during extreme flash flooding events, which were associated with the land cover of the major urban river catchments in Tokyo. This work provides a new perspective for understanding Cs-137 behaviour associated with reproduction of sediment deposition and prediction of Cs-137 concentration in the major urban rivers of Tokyo, incorporating the effects of baseline Cs-137 behaviour with the impact of sediment particle adsorption in a volcanic ash soil-covered terrace.

This segment of sedimentology still records important progress using experimental models and field examples. This study focuses on the alluvial stratigraphy of the Volkovce Fm. which was deposited between similar to 9.0-6.0 Ma in the northern Pannonian Basin System, and it provides an excellent natural laboratory to study this topic. The spatial variability of channel belt distribution was determined in 809 borehole logs drilled to 200-300 m depths while the facies associations were defined on the outcrops. A significant variance in channel belt content was observed, since it reaches 10-40% of the stratigraphic column in the southwestern part of the study area and only 0-15% in the northeastern portion. Moreover, the transition between the areas of different channel belt distribution is oriented perpendicular to the paleo-drainage network axis. Geochronology was then established by applying the authigenic Be-10/Be-9 dating method to three borehole cores. The Bayesian age-depth models used herein proved a decrease in average accommodation rates from similar to 200 m/Myr to similar to 50 m/Myr towards the area with <15% of channel belts. The results indicate that the four times higher subsidence caused dominant deposition of channel belts in the area of maximum subsidence and avoided the basin-scale avulsion to relocate the channels in the area of lower accommodation rate. This was most likely caused by topographic confinement. The deposition of poorly-drained floodplain and swamp facies appeared in the area of lower accommodation rate, where absence of channels caused low sediment supply. The study highlights that authigenic Be-10/Be-9 dating Bayesian age-depth models can provide a strong geochronological framework for the late Cenozoic alluvial depositional record necessary for interpretation of the influence of allogenic factors on stratigraphic architecture.

However, the effect of variability of RC due to human-induced activities on hydrologic behavior of the watershed has not been adequately considered globally. Therefore, the present research was carried out using 18 hyetographs and their corresponding hydrographs during 1984 to 2012 after considering the existence of suitable Landsat 7 (ETM+ and TM) satellite images with corresponding storm events for the Amameh Watershed located in Tehran Province, Iran. The object-oriented classification method was used to derive land use maps from satellite images. Afterward, four time periods were determined based on mean and standard deviation of residential area variations. The temporal distribution pattern of RC was then derived using a ranking method. The one- and two-way analyses of variance were also used to investigate the effect of residential area and rainfall variables on RC. Relationships among residential area as well as rainfall variables as independent variables and mean RC storm-wise as dependent variable were then modeled using two and multiple linear regressions. The results showed that RCs reduced in order of third, second, fourth, and first quartiles with respective values of 42.4, 38.2, 15.8, and 3.6%. The results also showed that RCs in the second and first quartiles and in the third and fourth quartiles were non-significantly decreased and increased by increasing of residential area, respectively. So that the highest variations occurred in first quartile with slope of - 144%. The results further proved that rainfall amount, phi index, and residential area with respective standardized regression coefficients (beta) of 0.629, - 0.465, and - 0.108 had the highest controlling effects on RCs. The finding of the current research proved the temporal variability of RCs at storm scale with more determinant effectiveness of rainfall properties than urbanized interferences. It helps hydrologists and watershed mangers designate appropriate strategies leading to proper implementations of developmental projects.

A key modeling decision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized It has been common to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that their squared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, we conclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poor reproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are used for flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performance metrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM), and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basins throughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are (1) NSE, (2) Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annual peak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metric that focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces the best annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on other high-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results in annual peak flow estimates that are more than 20 % worse, primarily due to the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On the other hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that are better than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean and variance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect to other related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of the components of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulations based on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics, regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize that improving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministically calibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics (for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to the desired goals of model calibration.

Diets identified herein show that Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea) nestlings were provisioned with aquatic prey throughout the breeding season across their range, but with variation in prey frequency of occurrence and taxonomy. Anthropogenic activity and climate change may impact the trophic link especially between aquatic and riparian habitats by altering the presence, abundance, and timing of prey availability. Thus, we used DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to quantify the frequency of occurrence of nestling diet items at 9 sites across their breeding range that differed in expected aquatic prey consumption. We analyzed spatial and temporal differences in the occurrence and multivariate diet assemblages of each prey source. Lepidoptera was the predominant terrestrial prey occurring in diets across space and time, whereas emergent aquatic insects and freshwater mollusks in aquatic diet exhibited greater variation. The frequency of emergent aquatic prey occurrence in nestling diets ranged from 61% to 100% across sites and was greater for early-season nestlings. The seasonal decrease in aquatic prey consumption indicates a potential temporal shift in the nutritional landscape from aquatic to terrestrial prey sources and a possible nutritional phenological mismatch for early nestlings as climate change advances the timing of insect emergence. Our findings also suggest that Prothonotary Warblers respond to environmental variability by consuming alternative prey and argue for future research investigating the extent to which shifting diets have nutritional consequences for riparian nestlings. center dot Prothonotary Warblers rely on wetland habitats, making them well-suited to understanding how consumers of aquatic prey respond to natural variability in prey over space and time and to wetland conditions that are degraded by human activities.center dot By using a DNA approach, we identify a broader range of aquatic and terrestrial diet items consumed by warbler nestlings than has been documented by visual observations.center dot We show that nestlings were regularly fed aquatic prey throughout their breeding range but varied in their aquatic diet composition, possibly due to differences in habitat composition, flooding, and impacts from nearby development and agriculture.center dot We also found that more early-season nestling diets contained emergent aquatic insects such as mayflies, whereas more late-season nestling diets contained mollusks and terrestrial insects, suggesting a shift in diet sources over the breeding season. Las aves insectivoras riberenas no solo dependen de presas de insectos terrestres, sino que tambien se benefician de la inclusion de presas acuaticas durante periodos criticos de su historia de vida. Las dietas identificadas aqui muestran que los polluelos de Protonotaria citrea fueron provistos con presas acuaticas durante toda la temporada reproductiva en su area de distribucion, pero con variaciones en la frecuencia de ocurrencia y taxonomia de las presas. La actividad antropogenica y el cambio climatico pueden afectar especialmente el vinculo trofico entre los habitats acuaticos y riberenos al alterar la presencia, abundancia y temporalidad de la disponibilidad de presas. Por lo tanto, utilizamos el metodo de identificacion simultanea de multiples taxones con codigo de barras genetico de ADN a partir de muestras fecales para cuantificar la frecuencia de ocurrencia de los elementos de la dieta de los polluelos en 9 sitios a lo largo de su area de reproduccion que difirieron en el consumo esperado de presas acuaticas. Analizamos las diferencias espaciales y temporales en la ocurrencia y en los ensambles de dieta multivariados de cada fuente de presas. Lepidoptera fue la presa terrestre predominante en las dietas a lo largo del espacio y el tiempo, mientras que los insectos acuaticos emergentes y los moluscos de agua dulce presentes en la dieta acuatica mostraron una mayor variacion. La frecuencia de ocurrencia de presas acuaticas emergentes en las dietas de los polluelos vario del 61% al 100% entre los sitios y fue mayor para los polluelos de principios de la temporada. La disminucion estacional en el consumo de presas acuaticas indica un posible cambio temporal en el paisaje nutricional desde fuentes de presas acuaticas hacia terrestres y una posible falta de sincronizacion fenologica nutricional para los polluelos tempranos, a medida que el cambio climatico adelanta el momento de aparicion de los insectos. Nuestros hallazgos tambien sugieren que P. citrea responde a la variabilidad ambiental consumiendo presas alternativas, y abogan por investigaciones futuras que estudien en que medida los cambios en la dieta tienen consecuencias nutricionales para los polluelos riberenos.

These phenomena, causing loss of life and massive property damage, pose a serious threat to the economy. Hydrological modeling is extremely important in terms of climate change, and the use of appropriate modeling can be a useful tool for flood risk prevention and mitigation. Rainfall-runoff modeling requires the selection of an appropriate hydrological model in order to obtain satisfactory results. Hydrological models are used in water resource planning and management to estimate catchment runoff. Small uncontrolled catchments play a particularly important role in hydrological phenomena, since changes in them affect flows in the recipient. Hydrologists are particularly interested in developing hydrological models that can be made with a minimum of data and parameters. Nash models and the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) are examples of simple and most practical hydrologic models. These models were used in this paper to study geographic and qualitative changes in precipitation runoff due to land cover changes. The modeling was carried out for two spatial aspects relating to the years 1940 and 2018. The model allowed for the simulation of the river flow that can occur under different rainfall probabilities. The analysis of the results was used to evaluate the hydrological models used. The hundred-year flow modeled with the Nash model for 1940 was 13.4 m(3)center dot s(-1), whereas the second model gave slightly lower flow values. In addition, modeling the flow for 2018 (after changing the land cover) highlighted the increase in the flow value for both models, where again the flow volume was slightly higher for the Nash model and amounted to about 19 m(3)center dot s(-1). The flow differences for individual models were not too large. This made it possible to conclude that the simulated outflow hydrographs are in good agreement, and this means that the models accurately reproduce the flow of the Michalowka River. The study showed that rapid urbanization adversely affects hydrological processes. In addition, the study showed that a well-distributed model can outperform a global flood forecasting model, especially in terms of magnitude, as in the current study example.

Nature as a solution for shoreline protection against coastal risks associated with ongoing sea-level rise	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal protection; Climate adaptation; Nature-based solutions; InVEST coastal vulnerability model; Ecosystem services	CORAL-REEFS; AREAS; CONSERVATION; DEFENSE; FACE	The risks from climate change are ever-growing, especially in more vulnerable and exposed regions such as coastlines. The rise in sea level and increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-induced coastal hazards are threatening the increasing coastal populations. Brazil, with its 8,500 km of coast, is one of the countries most at risk from coastal flooding and erosion. Nature-based solutions have been suggested as climate adaptation strategies with the greatest potential to counteract coastal hazards stemming from sea-level rise and safeguard coastal cities. However, there is still a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of naturebased solutions, especially at large spatial scales in Central and South America. Here, we assessed the risks from climate-induced hazards of coastal erosion and flooding related to sea-level rise on the Brazilian coast, and the effectiveness of nature-based solutions as climate adaptation strategies. We reveal that nature-based shoreline protection can reduce by 2.5 times the risks to the Brazilian coastline. The loss of existing natural habitats would substantially increase the area and population at risk from these climate-induced hazards. Worrisomely, legal mechanisms to protect these natural habitats are few and being weakened. Only 10% of the coastal natural habitats are within protected areas, and these alone do not ensure coastal protection, as our results indicate that the loss of unprotected natural habitats has about the same risk as the total absence of natural habitats. Our results warn of the severe consequences of the continued loss of natural habitats along the coast. Thus, actions towards the maintenance and protection of coastal habitats are paramount for climate adaptation and to ensure the well-being and livelihoods of coastal populations. Brazil has a central role in demonstrating the benefits of strategies based on nature-based solutions for shoreline protection, favoring their implementation worldwide. We provide both the natural habitat maps and the maps with model results with spatial and numerical information so readers can explore the relations between the natural habitats and coastal risk indexes at a subnational level and foster their use by local stakeholders.

PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; COASTAL EVERGLADES; SEA-LEVEL; BRUGUIERA-GYMNORRHIZA; GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER	We investigated how mangrove-island micro-elevation (i.e., habitat: center vs edge) affects tree physiology in a scrub mangrove forest of the southeastern Everglades. We measured leaf gas exchange rates of scrub Rhizophora mangle L. trees monthly during 2019, hypothesizing that CO2 assimilation (A(net)) and stomatal conductance (g(sw)) would decline with increasing water levels and salinity, expecting more considerable differences at mangrove-island edges than centers, where physiological stress is greatest. Water levels varied between 0 and 60 cm from the soil surface, rising during the wet season (May-October) relative to the dry season (November-April). Porewater salinity ranged from 15 to 30 p.p.t., being higher at mangrove-island edges than centers. A(net) maximized at 15.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and g(sw) was typically <0.2 mol m(-2) s(-1), both of which were greater in the dry than the wet season and greater at island centers than edges, with seasonal variability being roughly equal to variation between habitats. After accounting for season and habitat, water level positively affected A(net) in both seasons but did not affect g(sw). Our findings suggest that inundation stress (i.e., water level) is the primary driver of variation in leaf gas exchange rates of scrub mangroves in the Florida Everglades, while also constraining A(net) more than g(sw). The interaction between inundation stress due to permanent flooding and habitat varies with season as physiological stress is alleviated at higher-elevation mangrove-island center habitats during the dry season. Freshwater inflows during the wet season increase water levels and inundation stress at higher-elevation mangrove-island centers, but also potentially alleviate salt and sulfide stress in soils. Thus, habitat heterogeneity leads to differences in nutrient and water acquisition and use between trees growing in island centers versus edges, creating distinct physiological controls on photosynthesis, which likely affect carbon flux dynamics of scrub mangroves in the Everglades.

We systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU, SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands, ponds, trees, parks, grass, green roof/ walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs, mangroves, sea grasses, oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches and dunes. We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range of social and economic co-benefits. However, there is still a need for bespoke modelling tools that can holistically assess the various components of NBS from an HMR reduction and management perspective. Such tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating the implementation of NBS. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

There is therefore a pressing need to obtain comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and area of glacial lakes and also to quantify the variability in their sizes and types at high resolution in HMA. In this work, we developed an HMA glacial-lake inventory (Hi-MAG) database to characterize the annual coverage of glacial lakes from 2008 to 2017 at 30m resolution using Landsat satellite imagery. Our data show that glacial lakes exhibited a total area increase of 90.14 km(2) in the period 2008-2017, a +/-:90% change relative to 2008 (1305.59 +/- 213.99 km(2)). The annual increases in the number and area of lakes were 306 and 12 km(2), respectively, and the greatest increase in the number of lakes occurred at 5400m elevation, which increased by 249. Proglacial-lake-dominated areas, such as the Nyainqentanglha and central Himalaya, where more than half of the glacial-lake area (summed over a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid) consisted of proglacial lakes, showed obvious lake-area expansion. Conversely, some regions of eastern Tibetan mountains and Hengduan Shan, where unconnected glacial lakes occupied over half of the total lake area in each grid, exhibited stability or a slight reduction in lake area. Our results demonstrate that proglacial lakes are a main contributor to recent lake evolution in HMA, accounting for 62.87% (56.67 km(2)) of the total area increase. Proglacial lakes in the Himalaya ranges alone accounted for 36.27% (32.70 km(2)) of the total area increase. Regional geographic variability in debris cover, together with trends in warming and precipitation over the past few decades, largely explains the current distribution of supraglacial- and proglacial-lake area across HMA. The Hi-MAG database is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4275164 (Chen et al., 2020), and it can be used for studies of the complex interactions between glaciers, climate and glacial lakes, studies of GLOFs, and water resources.

Therefore, it is important to ensure the accuracy of rainfall input data to increase the accuracy of the watershed model results. Securing rainfall measurements with finer spatial and temporal resolutions is important in predicting flowrate variations at a sub catchment, especially as they relate to global and local climate changes in weather conditions such as rainfall depth, rainfall intensity, etc. In this study, adjusted radar-rainfall estimates were suggested as alternative input data for watershed modeling. Through a statistical analysis of the representativeness of a ground rainfall measurement (10 km x 10 km grid), the necessity of radar-rainfall estimates (2 km x 2 km grid) was identified. By applying calibration factors to initial radar-rainfall estimates and comparing adjusted radar-rainfall estimates with ground rainfall measurements, it was proven that adjusted radar-rainfall estimates could be used as input data for watershed simulations (NSE > 0.92; n = 12). Adjusted radar-rainfall estimates and ground rainfall measurements were used as input data of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to predict flowrate variations at the outlets of a tributary and the entire watershed. As a result, the accuracies of the simulation results were improved for the outlets of a tributary and the entire watershed (NSE: 0.33 to 0.48 and 0.19 to 0.55, respectively). To obtain more reliable rainfall data, radar images easily accessible to users were applied, and the accuracy of the data was increased by applying simple equations to numerical data extracted from radar image processing. Additionally, the applicability of the adjusted radar-rainfall estimates was demonstrated by comparing the modeling results using the suggested rainfall data and existing ground-based rainfall data. The suggested methodologies are expected to contribute to more accurately predict the possibility of flood disasters in other regions and countries lacking infrastructure related to rainfall measurements and to establish appropriate countermeasures.

Performances of precipitation datasets based on multiple interpolation methods (i.e., inverse distance weighted [IDW], cokriging, and ANUSPLIN) and satellite remote sensing datasets (i.e., tropical rainfall measuring mission multi-satellite precipitation analysis 3B42 version7 [TRMM 3B42V7], precipitation estimation from remote sensing information using artificial neural networks-climate data record [PERSIANN-CDR], climate predication centre morphing technique, and sian precipitation-highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources [APHRODITE]) were obtained for comparison. Hydrological responses from these precipitation datasets were evaluated through distributed hydrological model variable infiltration capacity. The Yalong river basin (YRB), located in the Hengduan Mountains region and characterized by the significant heterogeneity of precipitation in China, was focused. Four sub-regions (i.e., sub-region I to IV) were divided. The results indicated that: (a) TRMM 3B42V7 and APHRODITE data were superior in detection capability from daily to annual measurement than other satellite precipitation data sets generally; (b) under the scale of gauges, TRMM 3B42V7, APHRODITE, and cokriging performed well in sub-regions I, II, and IV, respectively. In sub-region III, performance of the interpolation methods was better than that of TRMM 3B42V7; (c) the interpolation datasets exhibited a poor capability to simulate peak runoff. The combination dataset COM could improve the overall runoff simulation in flood periods; and (d) the interpolation method has the problem of excessive smoothness. Whatever the interpolation dataset is, hydrological simulation tends to result in smaller runoff, which was related to that the measurements from meteorological stations in mountainous valleys are not necessarily representative of the entire region. In this paper, the applicability of multi-source precipitation data in the hydrological simulation process of YRB was comprehensively analysed, which could provide effective references for improving the accuracy of precipitation data and the applicability of hydrological simulation.

The impact of floods on emergency department (ED) operations and patient health has not been well studied. We sought to detail challenges and lessons learned from the severe weather event caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. in August 2017. Methods: This report combines narrative data from interviews with retrospective data on patient volumes. mode of arrival, and ED lengths of stay (LOS). We compared the five-week peri-storm period for the 2017 hurricane to similar periods in 2015 and 2016. Results: For five days, flooding limited access to the hospital, with a consequent negative impact on provider staffing availability. disposition and transfer processes. and resource consumption. Interruption of patient transfer capabilities threatened patient safety, but flexibility of operations prevented poor outcomes. The total ED patient census for the study period decreased in 2017 (7062 patients) compared to 2015 (7665 patients) and 2016 (7770) patients). Over the five-week study period, the arrival-by-ambulance rate was 12.45% in 2017 compared to 10.1% in 2016 (p < 0.0001) and 13.7% in 2015 (p < 0.0001). The median ED length of stay (LOS) in minutes for admitted patients was 976 minutes in 2015 (p < 0.0001) compared to 723 minutes in 2016 and 591 in 2017 (p < 0.0001). For discharged patients, median ED LOS was 336 minutes in 2016 compared to 356 in 2015 (p < 0.0001) and 261 in 2017 (p < 0.0001). Median boarding time for admitted ED patients was 284 minutes in 2016 compared to 470 in 2015 (p < 0.0001) and 234.5 in 2017 (p < 0.001). Water damage resulted in a loss of 133 of 179 inpatient beds (74%). Rapid and dynamic ED process changes were made to share ED beds with admitted patients and to maximize transfers post-flooding to decrease ED boarding times. Conclusion: A number of pre-storm preparations could have allowed for smoother and safer ride-out functioning for both hospital personnel and patients. These measures include surplus provisioning of staff and supplies to account for limited facility access. During a disaster, innovative flexibility of both ED and hospital operations may be critical when disposition and transfer capibilities or bedding capacity are compromised.

Hence, exploring land-use/cover dynamic is important in order to improve our understanding of the causes of forest-cover change and to detect the future trend. Furthermore, projecting a future land-use/cover pattern can help identifying potential areas where forest-cover change will occur in the future and the potential consequences of these processes in order to improve land-use planning and policies. Similar to other East European countries, Romania is experiencing rapid land-use/cover changes after the breakdown of socialism; a clear trend was registered by deforestation, which reflects the consequences of a continuous forests dynamics and little environmental care. Consequently, this study, carried out in order to analyse the potential future cover-change, resulted in the land-use/cover scenario (2007-2050) simulated using CLUE-S (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) modelling framework, applied to development regions in Romania. Overall, the model results in different spatial patterns of land-use/cover change, projecting a slight increase in the forest-cover area of about 82,000 ha. Furthermore, the model simulated widespread deforestation, mainly in relation to agricultural land expansion. The area under the curve (AUC) for the relative operating characteristic (ROC) and the Kappa simulation (K-Simulation) were used to assess the predictive power of the determinant factors included and to evaluate the spatial performance of the model. The obtained ROC/AUC values (0.83-0.88) indicate the great power of the determinant factors to explain the forest-cover pattern in the area. Furthermore, the K-Simulation scores (0.69-0.79) highlight the potential of the CLUE-S model to simulate future forest-cover change in relation to the other land-use/cover categories. The results can provide useful inputs for effective forest resource management and environmental policies. Moreover, the spatial data obtained can contribute to exploring future potential environmental implications (e.g. assessing landslide and flood hazard scenarios, forest biomass dynamics and their impact on carbon allocation, or the impact of forest-cover change on ecosystem services).

This study utilized a Bayesian framework with informed priors on shape parameter for a generalized extreme value (GEV) model for the estimation of design flood quantiles for at site analysis in a changing environment, and discussed its implications for flood management in the Kabul River basin (KRB), Pakistan. Initially, 29 study sites in the KRB were used to evaluate the annual maximum flood regime by applying the Mann-Kendall test. Stationary (without trend) and a non-stationary (with trend) Bayesian models for flood frequency estimation were used, and their results were compared using the corresponding flood frequency curves (FFCs), along with their uncertainty bounds. The results of trend analysis revealed significant positive trends for 27.6% of the gauges, and 10% showed significant negative trends at the significance level of 0.05. In addition to these, 6.9% of the gauges also represented significant positive trends at the significance level of 0.1, while the remaining stations displayed insignificant trends. The non-stationary Bayesian model was found to be reliable for study sites possessing a statistically significant trend at the significance level of 0.05, while the stationary Bayesian model overestimated or underestimated the flood hazard for these sites. Therefore, it is vital to consider the presence of non-stationarity for sustainable flood management under a changing environment in the KRB, which has a rich history of flooding. Furthermore, this study also states a regional shape parameter value of 0.26 for the KRB, which can be further used as an informed prior on shape parameter if the study site under consideration possesses the flood type flash. The synchronized appearance of a significant increase and decrease of trends within very close gauge stations is worth paying attention to. The present study, which considers non-stationarity in the flood regime, will provide a reference for hydrologists, water resource managers, planners, and decision makers.

J	Sánchez-García, C; Schulte, L				Sanchez-Garcia, C.; Schulte, L.			Historical floods in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula since the 16th century: Trends and regional analysis of extreme flood events	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						Historical floods; Historical archives; Extreme floods; Flood trends	FREQUENCY ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DOCUMENTARY SOURCES; RIVER; SPAIN; BASIN; OSCILLATION; MAGNITUDE; HYDROLOGY; PATTERNS	Studies related to historical floods have generated much knowledge about flood patterns and frequencies in recent years. Extending the series of floods to a longer range of time allows society to clarify what has happened in the past, and thus know what may happen in the future. From the descriptions of primary and secondary sources, a classification of historical floods has been carried out following a method specifically adapted for the study area. The southeastern Iberian Peninsula is the last region to compile historical floods in the Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, the main objective of the present study is to extend the flood series of historical events for four river basins: the Almanzora, Antas, Aguas and Andarax. First, flood events are classified according to their descriptions, generating a dataset of all flood events from 1500 to the present day for each basin. Second, we analyze the trends in the historical series, identifying four trend periods linked with the availability of records: 1500-1850, 1850-1900, 1900-1955 and 1955-2000. Notably, the trend in recent decades has broken with normality because of the large number of lower magnitude events. Lastly, we compare our dataset with seven historical series from different rivers elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula. The results show a high correlation with all southeastern basins and less with the northern and Atlantic basins. For the purposes of the analysis, we considered only the extraordinary and catastrophic floods in all basins, that is, the floods of magnitude 3 or 4 (M3 or M4), and we identified two flood gaps in 1500-1540 and 1660-1720; two flood-poor periods in 1790-1845 and 1955-1970; and five flood-rich periods in 1540-1560, 1610-1654, 1720-1745, 1860-1891 and 1970-1990 in relation to the four river basins in the study area and the other seven Iberian basins, the last century is highly biased by the construction of reservoirs in all basins. The analysis of historical floods shows a link between the flood-gap periods and negative phases of NAOi and TSI. From 1970, lower flood magnitudes occurred during periods of highest amounts of information, an increase in tourism areas. Consequently, the last flood-rich period clearly stands out because of the disparity of the data, and the consequences are biased, for example, by surface runoff in urban areas where non-irrigated agricultural areas were traditionally located, resulting in an increase in economic damage.

Spatial and Temporal Variation of Climatic Elements and its Impact on the Yield of Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) in Masbate, Philippines	PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						climatic elements; rice productivity; temporal and spatial variation	DIOSCOREA-HISPIDA DENNST; TUBER STORAGE PROTEIN; YAM; BIOSYNTHESIS; BITTERNESS; TOXICITY; GENUS; ACID	As a C-3 crop, the growth and development of rice is greatly affected by the fluctuations and occurrences of climatic extremes particularly at critical growth stages. This study was conducted to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of climatic elements and assess its impact on the yield of rice in the province of Masbate. Remotely-sensed climatic data from 1991 to 2020 and data from the lone synoptic weather station of PAGASA in Masbate were used in this study. Yield production data were sourced from Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) and Provincial Agriculture Office of Masbate (PAO-Masbate). Temporal analysis revealed that the direction and magnitude of trends of various climatic elements in the province of Masbate differ annually and seasonally. The only significant trends, however, are that of the decreasing trend of Tmax and Tmean. Except for rainfall, temporal variation of Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean is negatively and significantly correlated to rice yield. In general, 1 degrees C increase would result in 10-24% reduction in yield. Spatial analysis revealed that, except for solar radiation, a significant difference was detected in rainfall and temperatures in various areas in Masbate. These differences in localized climate could be due to mountain ranges and other characteristics of land surface, such as land use and land cover. While correlation analysis showed that the yield and the amount of rainfall in Masbate are not significantly related, data during 1991-2019 show that rainfall is potentially one of the most limiting factors in the province's rice production. On top of the increasing trend of the number of dry days, the amount of rainfall is just adequate to supply the minimum requirement of rice during wet season but a bit short during dry season. These scenarios indicate that drought is more of a problem rather than waterlogging or flooding in Masbate's rice production, especially during dry season. Aside from rainfall, temperature extremes greatly affect rice productivity in Masbate. There are months in Masbate when recorded temperatures exceed that of the optimum requirement of rice crop. To minimize the negative impacts of drought and temperature extremes in the rice production in Masbate, more irrigation facilities should be established considering that 70% of rice production is rainfed, a cropping calendar based on the climatic data must be followed, and planting climate change-ready rice cultivars such as those tolerant to drought and high temperatures must be considered.

While climate change is increasing the risk of floods in many vulnerable regions of the world, the commonly used crisis map is inefficient and cannot rapidly determine the spatial variation and intensity of flooding extension across the affected areas. In such cases, the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistic can detect heterogeneity or the flooding hotspot at a local spatial scale beyond routine mapping. This area, however, has not yet been studied in the context of the magnitude of the floods. The present study incorporates the LISA methodology including Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the occurrence of flooding from super cyclone Amphan across 16 coastal districts of Bangladesh. Using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, "water" and "land" were classified for the pre-event (16 May 2020) and post-events (22 May, 28 May, and 7 June 2020) of the area under study. A Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and visual comparison were used to evaluate the flood maps. A compelling agreement was accomplished between the observed and predicted flood maps, with an overall precision of above 95% for all SAR classified images. As per this study, 2233 km(2) (8%) of the region is estimated to have been inundated on 22 May. After this point, the intensity and aerial expansion of flood decreased to 1490 km(2) by 28 May before it increased slightly to 1520 km(2) (2.1% of the study area) on 7 June. The results from LISA indicated that the main flooding hotspots were located in the central part, particularly in the region off the north-east of the mangrove forest. A total of 238 Unions (smallest administrative units) were identified as high flooding hotspots (p < 0.05) on 22 May, but the number of flooding hotspots dropped to 166 in the second week (28 May) after Amphan subsided before it increased to a further 208 hotspots (p < 0.05) on 7 June due to incessant rainfall and riverbank failure in the south-west part of the study area. As such, an appropriate, timely, and cost-effective strategy would be to assess existing flooding management policies through the identified flooding hotspot regions. This identification would then allow for the creation of an improved policy to help curtail the destructive effects of flooding in the future.

J	Xu, XY; Maruyama, A; Kusaka, H				Xu, Xiaoyu; Maruyama, Atsushi; Kusaka, Hiroyuki			Improvements in the Land and Crop Modeling Over Flooded Rice Fields by Incorporating the Shallow Paddy Water	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						paddy surface water; Noah-MP land model; calibrated crop parameters; ground surface resistance; paddy water depth	SURFACE MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH-MODEL; SIMULATION-MODEL; UNITED-STATES; V. 1; IRRIGATION; CONDUCTANCE; REQUIREMENT; UNCERTAINTY	Flooded rice paddies are important for modifying land surface energy and water budgets, especially in Asian countries. This study incorporated shallow paddy water into the Noah with Multi-Parameterization (Noah-MP) model to enhance its performance in capturing the distinct features of small Bowen ratios over flooded rice fields. The paddy surface water was parameterized as one integrated layer along with the top soil layer, and meteorological measurements from two crop sites in Japan, that is, SAITO (early rice) and SAGA (late rice), were employed for model evaluation at the field scale. The simulation results show that the model performance was significantly improved by combining the incorporation of paddy water and the calibration of rice crop parameters, particularly at SAGA. Compared with the reference run using the original version of Noah-MP for SAGA, the underestimation in latent heat and the overestimation in sensible heat during daytime were decreased by similar to 74 W m(-2) (similar to 67%) and similar to 92 W m(-2) (similar to 55%), respectively. Approximately 60%-70% of this improvement was contributed by using calibrated rice crop parameters, while the rest of 30%-40% was from further incorporating paddy water. The decreased ground surface resistance owing to the presence of paddy water was crucial for capturing the features of small Bowen ratios. The observed water depth might help mitigate the underestimation of latent heat nonlinearly. This work may benefit the study of land-atmosphere interactions and local and regional weather and climate in Asia with the widely used coupled Weather Research and Forecasting/Noah-MP model. Plain Language Summary As a staple food for approximately half the global population, rice is typically grown in flooded paddy fields, the distinct feature of which is a small ratio of sensible heat to latent heat. The presence of paddy water significantly modifies land surface energy and water budgets; however, such a shallow water layer in paddy fields has not been considered in many land surface models such as Noah-MP. Noah-MP is a well-known land surface scheme coupled into the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the largest number of users in the atmospheric science field. To improve the model performance over flooded rice fields, this study incorporated paddy surface water into Noah-MP and investigated the roles of some key parameters such as ground surface resistance and water depth. The model evaluation shows that the combination of using calibrated crop parameters for rice and correctly implementing the paddy water module helped mitigate the overestimation in sensible heat and the underestimation in latent heat. This work will be beneficial for the study of land-atmosphere interactions and local and regional weather and climate, especially in Asia.

Homogeneous Environmental Selection Structures the Bacterial Communities of Benthic Biofilms in Proglacial Floodplain Streams	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						proglacial floodplains; benthic biofilms; microbial diversity; 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons; climate change; assembly processes	HABITAT; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; HETEROGENEITY; DATABASE; ECOLOGY	Streams draining proglacial floodplains harbor benthic biofilms comprised of diverse microbial communities. These high-mountain ecosystems are rapidly changing with climate warming, and it is therefore critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying the assembly of their microbial communities. In proglacial floodplains, glacier recession promotes biogeochemical and ecological gradients across relatively small spatial scales. The resulting environmental heterogeneity induces remarkable microbial biodiversity among proglacial stream biofilms. Yet the relative importance of environmental constraints in forming biofilm communities remains largely unknown. Extreme environmental conditions in proglacial streams may lead to the homogenizing selection of biofilm-forming microorganisms. However, environmental differences between proglacial streams may impose different selective forces, resulting in nested, spatially structured assembly processes. Here, we investigated bacterial community assembly processes by unraveling ecologically successful phylogenetic clades in two stream types (glacier-fed mainstems and non-glacier-fed tributaries) draining three proglacial floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Clades with low phylogenetic turnover rates were present in all stream types, including Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, while the other clades were specific to one stream type. These clades constituted up to 34.8% and 31.1% of the community diversity and up to 61.3% and 50.9% of the relative abundances in mainstems and tributaries, respectively, highlighting their importance and success in these communities. Furthermore, the proportion of bacteria under homogeneous selection was inversely related to the abundance of photoautotrophs, and these clades may therefore decrease in abundance with the future "greening" of proglacial habitats. Finally, we found little effect of physical distance from the glacier on clades under selection in glacier-fed streams, probably due to the high hydrological connectivity of our study reaches. Overall, these findings shed new light on the mechanisms of microbial biofilm assembly in proglacial streams and help us to predict their future in a rapidly changing environment.IMPORTANCE Streams draining proglacial floodplains harbor benthic biofilms comprised of diverse microbial communities. These high-mountain ecosystems are rapidly changing with climate warming, and it is therefore critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying the assembly of their microbial communities. We found that homogeneous selection dominates the structuring of bacterial communities in benthic biofilms in both glacier-fed mainstems and nonglacier tributary streams within three proglacial floodplains in the Swiss Alps. However, differences between glacier-fed and tributary ecosystems may impose differential selective forces. Here, we uncovered nested, spatially structured assembly processes for proglacial floodplain communities. Our analyses additionally provided insights into linkages between aquatic photoautotrophs and the bacterial taxa under homogeneous selection, potentially by providing a labile source of carbon in these otherwise carbon-deprived systems. In the future, we expect a shift in the bacterial communities under homogeneous selection in glacier-fed streams as primary production becomes more important and streams become "greener".

Although palynological studies of shallow marine deposits in the basins of Denmark and Germany suggest that deforestation and catastrophic soil loss occurred during the CAMP volcanism and ETE interval, the intensity and timing of continental weathering in the region of northwestern Tethys Ocean remain unclear. Here we present Sr, C, and O isotope data, as well as multivariate statistical analyses of major element contents, for carbonate-clastic deposits in the Kardolina section, Slovakia, to develop a continental weathering record in the NW Tethys during the ETE event. This section consists of a shallow marine carbonate sequence in the Rhaetian Fatra Formation and the overlying Hettangian Kopieniec Formation. The Fatra Formation represents ramp facies deposits that formed in a restricted pull-apart basin of the Fatric Zone along the southern margin of the Bohemian Massif in the region of northwestern Tethys. Carbon isotope analysis of the limestones revealed two negative carbon isotope excursions (NCIEs) in the uppermost Fatra Formation. These two NCIEs occurred in the latest Rhaetian and can be compared to the "precursor" and "initial" NCIEs reported for the northwestern Tethys. Strontium isotope analysis of the limestones revealed an abrupt increase in Sr isotope ratios between the precursor and initial NCIEs, which indicates that continental weathering of the Bohemian Massif increased rapidly in the latest Rhaetian. Multivariate analysis of major element contents in the carbonate rocks also shows that intense chemical weathering of the hinterland was accelerated after the precursor NCIE, supporting the inferences drawn from Sr isotopes. Furthermore, our study reveals that the carbonate depositional environments of the Fatra Formation changed to the formation of specific Fe-rich oolites with increased continental weathering after the precursor NCIE. The concentrations of redox-sensitive major elements (e.g., Mn and Fe) and multivariate analysis of the major element data suggest that the Fe-rich oolites were formed by an influx of O-depleted water into the shallow water depositional environment of the Fatra Formation. A possible origin for this O-depleted water is the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that formed at intermediate water depths in European basins (e.g., the German and Eiberg basins) during the latest Rhaetian. Our results suggest that the marine environment in the European basins may have developed an OMZ due to the increase in continental weathering during the latest Rhaetian, and these environmental changes may have had an important role in the marine ETE event.

Quantifying Spatiotemporal Variation of Reference Evapotranspiration and Its Contributing Climatic Factors in Bangladesh during 1981-2018	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Reference evapotranspiration; FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model; sensitivity coefficient; detrending method; contribution; evaporation paradox	PAN EVAPORATION; POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; RIVER-BASIN; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; WINTER-WHEAT; TRENDS; SENSITIVITY; REGION; MANAGEMENT; VARIABLES	Reference evapotranspiration is a vital research item for hydrologic pattern systems in drought-flood risks of a country like Bangladesh. The present research examines spatiotemporal fluctuations in reference evapotranspiration and influencing factors of these fluctuations by applying the Mann-Kendall test with the Theil-Sen's estimator, Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation method, differential equation and detrending method depending on diurnal meteorological data sets attained from 25 weather observatories between 1981 and 2018. By current research, the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (PM) model is executed for determining seasonal and annual reference evapotranspiration (ETPMF), and differential equation and detrending method is implemented for assessing correlation, sensitivities, and benefaction of four climatological variables to ETPMF. The MK trend analysis has been performed jointly with the Theil-Sen's estimator to discover movement of ETPMF and meteorological variables. ETPMF displayed a conspicuous descendant tendency (p < 0.01) at post-monsoon (-0.87 mm/year), winter (-1.13 mm/year), and annual time scale (-3.31 mm/year) in whole Bangladesh, but at the same period, a non-significant descending tendency of ETPMF was observed in pre-monsoon (-1.47 mm/year) and monsoon (-0.07 mm/year) season in the study area. These changes of ETPMF could be explained by a notable rising tendency in average temperature (TA) and actual vapor pressure (VP) and noteworthy declining tendencies in wind speed (WS) and sunshine duration (SD). ETPMF had been maximum sensitive to TA, a bit less, to VP, SD, and WS in the annual and seasonal periods. TA, WS, and SD produced a positive effect, whereas the VP negatively affected seasonal and annual ETPMF. Despite the negative effect on ETPMF, VP was the second most sensitive to the annual and all seasonal ETPMF after TA. Crosswise the entire study area, WS had the greatest influence to ETPMF, after that TA and SD. At the same time, the positive contribution of VP to ETPMF could not counterbalance the negative contributions of WS, TA, and SD. While the consequence of VP on variations in ETPMF is minor, it has to be considered particularly in the cold period. The counter association among inclining TA and declining ETPMF, which is known as the "evaporation paradox," happenned in Bangladesh. These research outcomes will be beneficial to develop forthcoming water scheduling and regulation of feasible water resources to lessen climate change effects on agronomic water prerequisites and regulate human induced actions.

Although OGPs (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N) appear to be a more sensitive indicator of past storm events than traditional proxies used in paleotempestology, the method has not been tested in many lakes with modern data. In this study, we measured the delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values of particulate organic matter (POM), along with the salinities and stable isotopic compositions of water (delta O-18 and delta D), in two coastal lakes on seasonal or much shorter time scales throughout a 3-year period. This work was intended to develop a better understanding of the dynamics of OGPs in these lakes. The time-series data not only show that geochemical properties of these lakes varied seasonally, reflecting variations in lake biological and environmental conditions, but displayed unique variation patterns in response to storms that caused either seawater flooding or freshwater flooding of the lakes. The data show that seawater flooding led to higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with either lower or no change in the C/N ratios of the POM, generally consistent with a previously proposed conceptual model for detecting seawater flooding events. The data also show that freshwater flooding reduces delta N-15 and increases the C/N values of POM, in addition to lowering the salinity, delta O-18 and delta D of lake water. These time series modern data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting past storm events that were large enough to cause either seawater or freshwater flooding by examining variation patterns of multiple OGPs in coastal lake sediments. Applying this understanding to a sediment core from one of the study lakes (Mullet Pond, Florida), we reconstructed a centuries-long record of storms based on the variation patterns in OGPs together with Pb-210 ages. The OGP-based storm record suggests that 30 flooding events, including 15 seawater flooding and 15 freshwater flooding incidents, occurred over the last 165 years. Almost all of these flooding events can be matched (within the dating uncertainty) to the historic hurricanes that are known to have passed within 150 km of the study site. This further confirms that OGPs preserved in sediments in coastal lakes of Florida or similar regions may be used as reliable recorders of past storm activity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, stable isotopes of C and N (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and a radioactive isotope of Pb-210 were used to investigate the factors affecting seasonal and long-term changes in N source apportionment and C and N biogeochemical processes in the Beijiang River located in the Pearl River basin, China. Source apportionment by a Bayesian model (stable isotopic analysis in R, SIAR) showed significant seasonal variations. During the flood season, the dominant origins were non-point sources, such as soil N for dissolved nitrogen (DN, accounting for 38%), soil organic matter for particulate organic matter (POM, 58%) and sedimentary organic matter (SOM, 31%), due to intense precipitation. During the non-flood season, fertilizer became the dominant nitrate source (48%), and effluent detritus prevailed in the POM (47%) and SOM (32%) pools. N transformation between the DN, POM and SOM was influenced by seasonally variable hydrology. Our data suggested that low discharge was more favorable for the vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation, which was supported by similar delta N-15 values in the DN, POM and SOM in the non-flood season. A sedimentary history record of 65 years (1951-2015) showed that the variation of N in the sediment was mainly affected by human activities. From 1999 to 2005, a decreasing trend in the delta N-15 values was observed due to the promotion of aquatic plant cultivation after reservoir impoundment. From 2005 to 2011, the enrichment in the delta N-15 values was caused by increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry. From 2011 to 2015, the increase in pollution treatment funds from the government improved the water environment, resulting in delta N-15 depletion in the sediment. At the 65-year temporal scale, increased temperature and CO2 concentration had less impact on the C and N cycles in river ecosystems, however, high discharge could increase the C and N contents, and flood events might increase the delta N-15 values in the sediment. This study provided more detailed information regarding the nutrient sources and improved our understanding of the C and N cycling processes at different temporal scales in river ecosystems.

Remote sensing technologies developed in recent years help to meet this demand with satellite-based precipitation products, particularly for ungauged basins. However, due to limitations and uncertainties, these products must be validated before being used in hydrometeorological/climatological applications. Validation studies also help improve retrieval algorithms by identifying errors and biases in the data that can be corrected or adjusted. One of NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement products, called Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), has been extensively validated for its ability to detect extreme precipitation events in drastically different climate regions across the world. However, such studies remain limited for Turkiye. In this study, we examined the ability of IMERG Early (E), Late (L), and Final (F) products to detect extreme precipitation in Turkiye using rain gauge data over an eleven-year period (2010-2020). We used extreme precipitation indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Indices (ETCCDI) to evaluate the ability of IMERG products to detect extreme precipitation. For the stations selected across Turkiye, the Pearson correlation coefficients (R) between daily ground-based precipitation measurements and the three IMERG precipitation products (IMERG-E, IMERG-L, and IMERG-F) were found to be 0.54, 0.55, and 0.64, respectively. IMERG products performed better in detecting the precipitation extreme based on the 85% percentile compared to the 95% and 99% percentiles. IMERG underestimates consecutive dry days by about 25% while overestimating consecutive wet days at the same rate. The performance of IMERG Early, Late, and Final products is inversely proportional to the daily precipitation totals. The annual intensity of precipitation outperformed in the Final run compared to other products across the country. Light and moderate rainfall was detected well, while the detection capability of IMERG decreased for heavy and heavy torrential precipitation. Geographically, the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Southeastern Anatolia regions generally performed better, while Eastern Anatolia and interior parts of the Black Sea region exhibited poorer performance. The low performance in Eastern Anatolia may be attributed to the region's mountainous terrain, while the low performance in the Black Sea region may be due to orographic forcing and land-sea interaction. Overall, the findings of this study showed that the detection capability of IMERG products performed better with increasing latency.

Public Health Data Applications Using the CDC Tracking Network: Augmenting Environmental Hazard Information With Lower-Latency NASA Data	GEOHEALTH			English	Article						air quality; flood; environmental public health; remote sensing	AEROSOL REANALYSIS	Exposure to environmental hazards is an important determinant of health, and the frequency and severity of exposures is expected to be impacted by climate change. Through a partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network is integrating timely observations and model data of priority environmental hazards into its publicly accessible Data Explorer (). Newly integrated data sets over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) include: daily 5-day forecasts of air quality based on the Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecast, daily historical (1980-present) concentrations of speciated PM2.5 based on the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications, version 2, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily near real-time maps of flooding (MCDWD). Data integrated into the CDC Tracking Network are broadly intended to improve community health through action by informing both research and early warning activities, including (a) describing temporal and spatial trends in disease and potential environmental exposures, (b) identifying populations most affected, (c) generating hypotheses about associations between health and environmental exposures, and (d) developing, guiding, and assessing environmental public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating health outcomes associated with environmental factors. The well-being of people and communities can be impacted by hazards like polluted air and flooding. This paper describes a new partnership to bring more timely information about U.S. air quality and flooding into a centralized online environmental public health platform, the CDC Tracking Network's Data Explorer. Timely monitoring and forecasting of environmental hazards have the potential to reduce harmful exposures by enabling early warnings and other timely public health interventions. Currently, near real-time data may not be readily accessible to public health practitioners, particularly those that need to react to public health emergencies, because the data are fragmented across multiple systems in formats inconsistent with typical public health uses. Developing data pipelines and processes to host this data in a usable and standardized format and disseminating the data via an existing online platform assists in making important information about environmental health hazards more readily accessible to public health practitioners, decision makers, and partners. Timely information can be critical for public health decision making, but environmental hazard data can be fragmented or hard to useThis work brings timely, routinely updated National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) data into CDC Tracking Network's Data Explorer in familiar and accessible formatsFor CONUS, daily NASA air quality forecasts, historical air quality data, and daily flood maps are integrated into the Data Explorer	[Amos, H.

Thaw-induced changes in organic matter transformations and mineral weathering reactions are impacting fluxes of inorganic carbon (IC) and alkalinity (ALK) in Arctic rivers. However, the net impact of these changing fluxes on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (pCO(2)) is relatively unconstrained. Resolving this uncertainty is important as thaw-driven changes in the fluxes of IC and ALK could produce feedbacks in the global carbon cycle. Enhanced production of sulfuric acid through sulfide oxidation is particularly poorly quantified despite its potential to remove ALK from the ocean-atmosphere system and increase pCO(2), producing a positive feedback leading to more warming and permafrost degradation. In this work, we quantified weathering in the Koyukuk River, a major tributary of the Yukon River draining discontinuous permafrost in central Alaska, based on water and sediment samples collected near the village of Huslia in summer 2018. Using measurements of major ion abundances and sulfate (SO42-) sulfur (S-34/S-32) and oxygen (O-18/O-16) isotope ratios, we employed the MEANDIR inversion model to quantify the relative importance of a suite of weathering processes and their net impact on pCO(2). Calculations found that approximately 80% of SO42- in mainstem samples derived from sulfide oxidation with the remainder from evaporite dissolution. Moreover, S-34/S-32 ratios, C-13/C-12 ratios of dissolved IC, and sulfur X-ray absorption spectra of mainstem, secondary channel, and floodplain pore fluid and sediment samples revealed modest degrees of microbial sulfate reduction within the floodplain. Weathering fluxes of ALK and IC result in lower values of pCO(2) over timescales shorter than carbonate compensation (similar to 10(4) yr) and, for mainstem samples, higher values of pCO(2) over timescales longer than carbonate compensation but shorter than the residence time of marine SO42- (similar to 10(7) yr). Furthermore, the absolute concentrations of SO42- and Mg2+ in the Koyukuk River, as well as the ratios of SO42- and Mg2+ to other dissolved weathering products, have increased over the past 50 years. Through analogy to similar trends in the Yukon River, we interpret these changes as reflecting enhanced sulfide oxidation due to ongoing exposure of previously frozen sediment and changes in the contributions of shallow and deep flow paths to the active channel. Overall, these findings confirm that sulfide oxidation is a substantial outcome of permafrost degradation and that the sulfur cycle responds to permafrost thaw with a timescale-dependent feedback on warming.

Drainage systems are not designed to cope with this increase, and as a result, floods are becoming more common in cities, particularly in the rapidly growing cities of China. To better cope with more frequent and severe urban flooding and to improve the water quality of stormwater runoff, the Chinese government launched the national Sponge City Construction (SCC) program in 2014. The current SCC design standards and guidelines are based on static values (e.g., return periods, rainfall intensities, and volume capture ratio (VCR)). They do not fully acknowledge the large differences in climate conditions across the country and assume that the hydraulic conditions will not change over time. This stationary approach stems from the traditional engineering approach designed for grey infrastructure (following a "one size fits all" approach). The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology to assess the VCR baseline (before construction in the pre-development stage) and changes in VCR (difference between the VCR of the pre- and post-development stage). The VCR of the post-development stage is one of the required indicators of the Assessment Standard for Sponge Cities Effects to evaluate SCC projects. In this study, the VCR was derived from remote-sensing-based land use land cover (LULC) change analysis, applying an unsupervised classification algorithm on different Landsat images from 1985 to 2015. A visualization method (based upon Sankey chart, which depicts the flows and their proportions of components) and a novel and practical partitioning method for built-up regions were developed to visualize and quantify the states and change flows of LULC. On the basis of these findings, we proposed a new indicator, referred to as VCRa-L, in order to assess the changes in urban hydrology after SCC construction. This study employed the city of Nanjing as a case study and analyzed detailed information on how LULC changes over time of built-up areas. The surface area of the urban and built-up areas of Nanjing quadrupled from 11% in 1985 to 44% in 2015. In the same period, neither the entire city nor its subregions reached the VCR target of 80%. The proposed new methodology aims to support national, regional, and city governments to identify and prioritize where to invest and implement SCC measures more effectively in cities across China.

Based on the observation and reanalysis data, a total of 41 PHREs during the mei-yu seasons of 1979-2020 are first identified over the MLYR and divided into prolonged (over 5 days) and normal (3-5 days) groups. The contributions of quasi-biweekly-scale and synoptic-scale components to the abovementioned two types of PHREs are analyzed. Prolonged PHREs are dominated by the quasi-biweekly component of precipitation (QBW_Pr), while normal PHREs depend on synoptic-scale components (SS_Pr). The quantitative moisture budget indicates that the favorable environment for the QBW_Pr of prolonged PHREs is associated with the interaction between background moisture and quasi-biweekly circulation disturbances. Approximately 80% of prolonged PHREs occurred in phases 6-8 of the boreal summer QBWO (BSISO2) life cycle. The large-scale meridional vertical circulation along the South China Sea (SCS)-MLYR, and the westward-propagating suppressed convection at low latitudes, accompanied by the substantial northward and upward moisture supply, signifi-cantly promotes and maintains the QBW_Pr for prolonged PHREs. In contrast, the QBWO signals are relatively insignifi-cant in the evolution of normal PHREs. The impact of the low-latitude QBWO on the prolonged PHREs is further confirmed by sensitivity experiments with RegCM4.9. As the QBWO are weakened on the southeast lateral boundary near the SCS, the vertical circulation and moisture transport clearly diminish along the SCS-MLYR. Consequentially, pre-cipitation reduces visibly during prolonged PHREs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Persistent heavy rainfall events (PHREs), as the reflection of the interaction among multiscale circulation systems, characterized by high intensity and wide coverage, are prone to cause severe flooding and death in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River valley (MLYR). This study aims to investigate the con-nection between PHREs and different time scales of atmospheric variability, thus elucidating the crucial factors and the influencing mechanisms for the prolonged PHREs during the mei-yu season. Our results reveal that the prolonged PHREs are dominated by the quasi-biweekly component of precipitation, while normal PHREs depend on the synoptic-scale component. The quasi-biweekly precipitation of prolonged PHREs is promoted and maintained by the meridional vertical circulation along the South China Sea (SCS)-MLYR, which is accompanied by the westward-propagating SCS QBWO-related suppressed convection at low latitudes. This study highlights the specific role of the low-latitude QBWO to the formation of prolonged PHREs relative to normal PHREs.

J	Payros, A; Pujalte, V; Schmitz, B				Payros, Aitor; Pujalte, Victoriano; Schmitz, Birger			Mid-latitude alluvial and hydroclimatic changes during the Paleocene- Eocene Thermal Maximum as recorded in the Tremp-Graus Basin, Spain	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY			English	Article						PETM; Palaeoclimate; Alluvial architecture; Claret Conglomerate; Yellowish Soils; Palaeosols	EXTREME PRECIPITATION EVENTS; SOUTH-CENTRAL PYRENEES; SEA-LEVEL; CARBON-CYCLE; CLIMATE; MICROCODIUM; EVOLUTION; BOUNDARY; MODEL; PETM	A short episode (-170 kyr) of extremely high global temperatures that occurred-56 Ma, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, is widely considered an ancient analogue of the ongoing anthropogenic warming. This ancient hyperthermal event consisted of three phases, onset, core and recovery, which are respectively represented in the mid-latitude south Pyrenean Tremp-Graus Basin by three successive terrestrial units, the Claret Conglomerate, the Yellowish Soils and the Gypsum-rich Unit, each of them recording a different sedimentary response to evolving climatic and hydrological regimes. The Claret Conglomerate is mainly made up of calcareous conglomerates and is acknowledged to record an abrupt hydrological change during the onset phase. This unit most likely formed in an alluvial megafan, an interpretation here reinforced with new architectural information and by comparison with naturally occurring small-scale fan-like accumulations. Assuming the similarity between the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the anthropogenic warming, recent hydrological and meteorological data from mid-latitude Spain were compiled for comparison purposes. This comparison concurs with published modelling results about hydroclimate changes in the Pyrenees during the hyperthermal event, postulating an enhancement of seasonal contrast with augmented frequency and intensity of floods but no significant change in total rain. Furthermore, the comparison suggests that the Claret Conglomerate accumulated during extreme rainfall episodes that mainly occurred in autumn. The Yellowish Soils are mostly composed of silty marls with ubiquitous small-sized carbonate nodules and intercalated calcarenites. The marls were deposited in floodplains and the calcarenites in point bars and crevasse splays of meandering rivers. The scarcity of conglomerates entails a near absence of strong currents, and the carbonate nodules perennial or seasonal arid conditions. These nodules occur within cumulate palaeosols, the development of which required regular sedimentary increments during inundations on the floodplains. Sedimentation rates of siliciclastic material on the floodplains increased significantly during the core of the hyperthermal event, as well as at river outlets in coastal settings, which shows that erosion was accelerated and rules out the occurrence of protective, dense vegetation. Combined, these characteristics suggest persistent very dry summers, but a smooth wet season without intense precipitation events. Lastly, the profusion of gypsum in the youngest unit is clear proof of an arid climate during the recovery of the hyperthermal event. In essence, the studied deposits provide a unique window into the sequence of hydroclimatic change during the rise, peak and decline of an ancient global warming event in a mid-latitude terrestrial setting, against which ongoing climate-change data and future projections can be compared.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

We develop metrics to compare the drought risk calculated under the assumptions of stationarity and nonstationarity and identify their spatial and temporal patterns. By analyzing the variability of drought risk in the past and exploring its ongoing patterns, we evaluate in which regions of the contiguous United States the assumption of stationarity can be safely used for drought risk planning and management. We find statistically significant interdecadal changes in the probability distribution functions of drought severity in parts of the Northwest, upper Midwest, the Northeast, eastern parts of Great Plains and in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada in the Southwest. In these regions, the nonstationary risk has been significantly higher than the stationary estimate of risk in the past, which shows that the assumption of stationarity can lead to the underestimation of drought risk in these regions. The multidecadal drought risk shows low variability in California, parts of northern and western Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and in the Southeast, since the statistical properties of droughts have not changed significantly in these regions during 1901-2017. However, the meteorological drought risk has increased in California and the Southeast in the recent decades due to the influence of global warming and hence the assumption of stationarity for risk estimation may lead to underestimation of drought risk in future in these regions if this effect of global warming persists. Plain Language Summary Traditionally, statistical approaches adopted by water resource managers for planning and design of water resource systems and infrastructure are based on the assumption of stationarity; that is, it is assumed that the probabilistic characteristics of the hydrological and meteorological processes do not change with time, and hence, the planning and designs for future can be based on the past observations. In this paper, we have evaluated the validity of the stationarity assumption for meteorological drought risk estimation at the multidecadal scale by comparing drought risk calculated under the assumptions of stationarity and nonstationarity, respectively, in different parts of the continental United States. We find statistically significant nonstationarity in meteorological droughts in the Northwest, upper Midwest, the Northeast, eastern Great Plains and in parts of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico in the Southwest United States, which results in high interdecadal variability of drought risk in these regions. This result demonstrates that the assumption of stationarity can lead to underestimation of drought risk in these regions, thereby exposing water resource systems to failure under severe droughts.

Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for Prioritizing Dam Removal	WATER			English	Article						dam removal; habitat patch connectivity; fish migration; probabilistic model; metrics	LAND-USE CONFLICTS; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; FRAMEWORK MODEL; FORESTED WATERSHEDS; WEATHERING RATES; NATIVE FISH	Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However, before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the connectivity results will be balanced with other important socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others. All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network. The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability. These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria. The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity, it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define exclusion areas for additional obstacles.

Rain-on-snow (ROS) events are a common cause of widespread flooding and are expected to increase in both frequency and magnitude with anthropogenic climate change in this region. ROS flood severity depends on terrestrial water input (TWI), the sum of rain and snowmelt that reaches the land surface. However, an incomplete understanding of the processes that control the flow and refreezing of liquid water in the snowpack limits flood prediction by operational and research models. We examine how antecedent snowpack conditions alter TWI during 71 ROS events between water years 1981 and 2019. Observations across a 500-m elevation gradient from the Independence Creek catchment were input into SNOWPACK, a one-dimensional, physically based snow model, initiated with the Richards equation and calibrated with collocated snow pillow observations. We compare observed "historical" and "scenario" ROS events, where we hold meteorologic conditions constant but vary snowpack conditions. Snowpack variables include cold content, snow density, liquid water content, and snow water equivalent. Results indicate that historical events with TWI > rain are associated with the largest observed streamflows. A multiple linear regression analysis of scenario events suggests that TWI is sensitive to interactions between snow density and cold content, with denser (>0.30 g cm(-3)) and colder (<-0.3 MJ of cold content) snowpacks retaining >50 mm of TWI. These results highlight the importance of hydraulic limitations in dense snowpacks and energy limitations in warm snowpacks for retaining liquid water that would otherwise be available as TWI for flooding. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to understand how the snowpack modulates quantities of water that reach the land surface during rain-on-snow (ROS) events. While the amount of near-term storm rainfall is reasonably predicted by meteorologists, major floods associated with ROS are more difficult to predict and are expected to increase in frequency. Our key findings are that liquid water inputs to the land surface vary with snowpack characteristics, and although many hydrologic models incorporate snowpack cold content and density to some degree, the complexity of ROS events justifies the need for additional observations to improve operational forecasting model results. Our findings suggest additional comparisons between existing forecasting models and those that physically rep-resent the snowpack, as well as field-based observations of cold content and density and liquid water content, would be useful follow-up investigations.

In the face of the climate change and pervasive extreme weather conditions, the importance of these ameliorative measures will be increasing. It is imperative to ensure appropriate functioning of these drainage systems. To be effective they need to be adequately operated and maintained, with maintenance measures performed appropriately and with required frequency. Basic ditch conservation procedures include mowing to remove vegetation overgrowth and cleanout to remove sediment. A significant problem in Poland results from an insufficient number of renovation and conservation operations performed on drainage systems, their gradual deterioration and depreciation. As a result, it is crucial to assess the need for renovation and modernisation of drainage ditches. It needs to be remembered that these operations interfere with the environment and may cause some unfavourable ecological changes. In view of the above, the authors of this publication conducted a thorough evaluation of both the required renovation of the investigated drainage ditch system and its current ecological status. The study area comprised the Strumien Junikowski catchment with the main outlet, i.e. Strumien Junikowski, its tributaries (the Skorzynka, Lawica, Plewianka, Ceglanka) as the main collection ditches and field ditches. During the field inspection the existing drainage structures were inventoried, with their technical condition assessed according to Kaca and Interewicz (1991). In this paper the characteristics of habitats found in the drainage area of the watercourse are presented along with the bioindicator analysis performed using the Macrophyte River Assessment Method. Based on the MIR index the ecological status of the stream was assessed and classified in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. The results demonstrate a significant variation of the ecological state of Strumien Junikowski over its entire course. The condition of the drainage structures in the drainage area varies. In the main watercourse of Strumien Junikowski the inspected culverts are in a good condition in contrast to the ones located on the tributaries. Vegetation overgrowth and sediment deposition in the ditches are major problems of the drainage area. This is caused by a lack of effective and systematic maintenance and renovation of the watercourses. The Strumien Junikowski drainage area is further being developed, which is associated with a rapid and increased discharge of rainwater and snowmelt. Thus it is necessary to maintain drainage ditches to ensure their optimal condition, which is essential to decrease the risk of flooding in the urban areas adjacent to the watercourse.

Flood events with diverse behavior characteristics vary greatly in spatial patterns and bring great challenges for flood management. In this study, the Peak Over Threshold (POT) approach coupled with an event-start-and-end detecting approach was proposed to separate flood events during 2008 -2018 across the Yangtze River Basin. Ten flood behavior metrics, comprehensively characterizing magnitude, duration, timing, rate of change, and flood forms of flood events, were used to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes. Subsequently, the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was revealed based on behavior similarity classification of numerous events. Furthermore, a Contribution-Based Impact Factor Analysis (CBIFA) method was constructed to investigate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to flood event variations. Results show that: (1) six flood event classes were identified including long-duration and small-rate-of-change flood events (Class 1, 31.00%), sharp-thin and short-tail flood events (Class 2, 20.58%), sharp-thin and early -peak flood events (Class 3, 5.12%), dwarf-fat flood events (Class 4, 18.37%), small and sharp-thin flood events (Class 5, 4.24%), and conventional events (Class 6, 20.67%). (2) Class 1 and Class 4, characterized by small rate of change, long duration and large magnitude, occurred across the whole Yangtze River Basin and mainly in the Middle-Lower Yangtze plains. Class 2 with small magnitude and short duration was mainly distributed in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Class 3, Class 5, and Class 6 mainly occurred in mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches, wherein Class 3 and Class 5 were characterized by large rate of change and short duration. (3) The meteorological factors were the most important impact factors and explained 30.23%-68.10% of the total flood event variations, followed by geographical (9.19%-32.10%), human activities (6.56%-23.17%), soil (9.19%-19.34%) and vegetation (2.56%-5.31%) factors. Identifying the spatial pattern of flood events and their driver factors is a crucial step toward accurate flood prediction and will finally provide essential information for reliable flood management.

Detailed investigation was carried out in this study on future extreme wave projections and its relationship with wind speed, sea level pressure (SLP), and sea-surface temperature (SST) for the mid- and end-century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Projections collectively highlight on maximum extreme wind and wave activity for south Indian Ocean (SIO) during June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON) seasons. Results indicate that end-century projections show extreme wind activity over central Bay of Bengal (BoB) signifying the likelihood for more extreme events over this region. Mid-century projections show that extreme significant wave height (SWH) intensifies by 1 m for the SIO during JJA season. Also, an increase of 0.4 m in maximum SWH (H-max) is projected for regions in the NIO, northwest AS, northeast BoB, and South China Sea (SCS). Projections for eastern SIO show strengthening of extreme wind speed by 3.0 m/s by the end-century under RCP8.5. The projected changes in H-max is maximum for SCS region evident in RCP4.5, whereas the maximum rise is about 23% under RCP8.5 in the end-century. Projected decline in winds and waves over western tropical IO (TIO) is consistent with weak SLP variations and warm ocean temperatures over that region. Significant increment in SST is projected over entire AS during DJF and JJA seasons ranging between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C, which is 0.5 degrees C greater than BoB. Projections for the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf show higher warming rates exceeding 2 degrees C under RCP8.5 by the end-century. Warming in these areas further reduces SLP gradient leading to enhanced weakening of low-level atmospheric circulation and declining H-max by the end-century. A westward alignment in these areas with maximum projected changes in SST is noticed in most seasons. Detailed analysis of high wave activity regions shows widening of generalized extreme value fitted probability density function over the BoB, SCS, and SIO indicating more extreme wave activity in the future.

Linking a rapid throughput plate-assay with high-sensitivity stable-isotope label LCMS quantification permits the identification and characterisation of low β-L-ODAP grass pea lines	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						beta-L-ODAP; BOAA; Chickpea; Grass pea; C-13-internal standard; Lathyrus sativus; LCMS; Pea; Spectrophotometric assay; Stable-isotope labelled	FREE AMINO-ACIDS; LATHYRUS-SATIVUS; BETA-N-OXALYL-L-ALPHA,BETA-DIAMINOPROPIONIC ACIDS; DIAMINOPROPIONIC ACID; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ALPHA; CHROMATOGRAPHY; REGISTRATION; DENCICHINE; ISOMER	Background Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) is an underutilised crop with high tolerance to drought and flooding stress and potential for maintaining food and nutritional security in the face of climate change. The presence of the neurotoxin beta-L-oxalyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (beta-L-ODAP) in tissues of the plant has limited its adoption as a staple crop. To assist in the detection of material with very low neurotoxin toxin levels, we have developed two novel methods to assay ODAP. The first, a version of a widely used spectrophotometric assay, modified for increased throughput, permits rapid screening of large populations of germplasm for low toxin lines and the second is a novel, mass spectrometric procedure to detect very small quantities of ODAP for research purposes and characterisation of new varieties. Results A plate assay, based on an established spectrophotometric method enabling high-throughput ODAP measurements, is described. In addition, we describe a novel liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based method for beta-L-ODAP-quantification. This method utilises an internal standard (di-C-13-labelled beta-L-ODAP) allowing accurate quantification of beta-L-ODAP in grass pea tissue samples. The synthesis of this standard is also described. The two methods are compared; the spectrophotometric assay lacked sensitivity and detected ODAP-like absorbance in chickpea and pea whereas the LCMS method did not detect any beta-L-ODAP in these species. The LCMS method was also used to quantify beta-L-ODAP accurately in different tissues of grass pea. Conclusions The plate-based spectrophotometric assay allows quantification of total ODAP in large numbers of samples, but its low sensitivity and inability to differentiate alpha- and beta-L-ODAP limit its usefulness for accurate quantification in low-ODAP samples. Coupled to the use of a stable isotope internal standard with LCMS that allows accurate quantification of beta-L-ODAP in grass pea samples with high sensitivity, these methods permit the identification and characterisation of grass pea lines with a very low ODAP content. The LCMS method is offered as a new 'gold standard' for beta-L-ODAP quantification, especially for the validation of existing and novel low- and/or zero-beta-L-ODAP genotypes.	[Emmrich, Peter M.

Non-seasalt potassium ion (K+) series in Greenland ice cores provide well-constrained timings for the events, and a direct timing relationship has been inferred between these events and the frequency of northerly cold polar/continental air outbreaks over the eastern Mediterranean Sea through gaps in the mountain ranges along the northern margin of the basin. There also appears to be a remarkable timing agreement with major archaeological turnover events in the Aegean/Levantine region. Yet no physically consistent assessment exists for understanding the regional climatic impacts of the events around this critical region. We present a simple 2-dimensional Lagrangian model, which yields a broad suite of physically coherent simulations of the impacts of frequency changes in winter-time northerly air outbreaks over the Aegean/Levantine region. We validate this with existing reconstructions from palaeoclimate proxy data, with emphasis on well-validated sea-surface temperature reconstructions and a highly resolved cave speleothem stable oxygen isotope record from Lebanon. Given that the RCCs were clearly marked by negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the region, we find that the predominant climatic impacts of this winter-time mechanism were "cold and wet," in contrast with intercalated "warmer and more arid" conditions of non-RCC periods. More specifically, the RCCs are found to be periods of highly variable conditions, with an overall tendency toward cold and wet conditions with potential for flash flooding and for episodic snow-cover at low altitudes, at least in the lower-altitude (lower 1-1.5 km) regions of Crete and the Levant. The modelled winter-anomaly process cannot address underlying longer-term, astronomically forced trends, or the relatively warm and arid anomalies in between RCCs. The latter require further study, for example with respect to potential (summer-time?) extension of evaporative subtropical conditions over the region. Finally, our results imply that the "amount effect" observed in Levantine cave delta O-18 (and precipitation or drip-water delta O-18) may not reflect the conventional concept related to temperature-dependent fractionation and Rayleigh distillation. Instead, it appears to arise from a complex and somewhat counter-intuitive mixing, in shifting proportionalities, between advected (external) and evaporated (Mediterranean) moisture.

Historical Shifts in Seasonality and Timing of Extreme Precipitation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme precipitation; seasonality; relative entropy; global domain; climate change; reanalysis	RAINFALL SEASONALITY; FUTURE CHANGES; CLIMATE; REGIONS; TRENDS; DRY	Global warming impacts the hydrological cycle, affecting the seasonality and timing of extreme precipitation. Understanding historical changes in extreme precipitation occurrence is crucial for assessing their impacts. This study uses relative entropy to analyze historical changes in seasonality and timing of extreme daily precipitation occurrences on the global domain for 63 years of fifth generation of the European Reanalysis reanalysis data. Our analysis reveals distinct regional patterns of change. During the second half of the 20th century, Africa and Asia experienced high clustering of precipitation extremes. Over the past 60 years, clustering increased in Africa while becoming more spread out in Asia. North America and Australia had initially lower clustering and showed slight increases over time. Extreme events in extra-tropical land regions mainly occurred in summer, with modest shifts in timing. These findings have implications for risk assessments of natural hazard like flash floods and landslides, emphasizing the necessity for region-specific adaptation strategies. Global warming is changing how and when heavy rain and extreme weather events happen. It is important to understand these changes for planning and preparing for floods and other water-related problems. In this study, we looked at long records of rainstorms to see how they have changed over time. We found that different regions have experienced different changes. During the second half of the 20th century, Africa and Asia were regions with the strongest seasonality. Over the 60 years we analyzed, seasonal clustering overall increased in Africa, while in Asia they became more spread out throughout the year. In Europe, North America and Australia, rainstorms were more spread out throughout the year but became slightly more concentrated. Most of the heavy rainstorms outside the tropics happened in summer, with a small shift in timing. These findings show how various regions have experienced different changes, which is important to take into account when planning and preparing for floods.

J	Amirmoradi, K; Shokoohi, A				Amirmoradi, Kimiya; Shokoohi, Alireza			River Flash Flood Economical Loss and its Uncertainty in Developing Countries	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Economic loss of flood; Depth-damage function; Risk management; EAD; Uncertainty		Namely: Floods can inflict significant damage on buildings, particularly in urban areas. Effective flood risk management in such areas relies on the ability to identify potential damages and high-risk locations. In the twenty-first century, this issue has become even more critical due to the rapid urbanization process and the intensification of short-term rainstorms and flash floods caused by climate change. Unfortunately, many developing countries lack accurate models for predicting and estimating flood damages at a national level. This article focuses on assessing the direct damages incurred by floods on buildings and their contents in urban areas, especially in regions with limited field data and unreliable damage functions. Five different models, including Life-Sim, Debo (J Hydraul Div Proc ASCE 108(10):1059-1069, 1982), Dutta et al. (J Hydrol 277:24-49, 2003), Luino et al. (J Geoinformatica 13:339-353, 2009), and Arrighi et al. (J Nat Hazards Earth Syst Sci 13:1375-1391, 2013), are discussed concerning building instability (or destruction) and percentage of damage to remaining buildings based on flood hydraulic characteristics such as depth and flow velocity. The economic damages caused by floods of varying return periods, representing the average long-term risk and expected annual damage (EAD), are examined for buildings in a specific region in Iran using the depth-damage functions from the aforementioned models. Moreover, the first-order variance estimation method (FOVE) is utilized to determine the confidence interval around the EAD, considering the challenge of defining probability density functions for damage across all cells in the basic. The depth-damage curve presented by Arrighi et al. (J Nat Hazards Earth Syst Sci 13:1375-1391, 2013) yields the most accurate estimation when compared to observed flood data on economic losses. An important finding of this research is the potential applicability of functions developed in other countries, despite differences in culture, architecture, and urban infrastructure. The method proposed in this article allows for a rapid estimate of flood damages in the absence of information and historical data, providing an acceptable approximation. Additionally, this research investigates the existence of uncertainty in estimating the expected annual damage, and raster maps.

No-till improves crop tolerance to extreme events by reducing soil evaporation and improving soil structural stability to enhance soil water storage capacity and crop resistance, but long-term mono-no-till cakes the soil, reducing crop yield. Combining intensive tillage with no-till can compensate for some deficiencies arising from conventional tillage or single no-till. A three-year field experiment was conducted in wet (2020) and normal (2019 and 2021, where a drought event occurred in 2021) years to study the effect of tillage practices on summer maize productivity under different precipitation types. Treatments included conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), ridge cultivation with no-tillage (RNT), and conventional tillage of winter wheat combined with no-tillage of summer maize (NC). Compared with NT, NC and RNT significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased soil porosity in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Compared with CT, NC and RNT significantly improved aggregate stability, NC increased available soil water storage by 19.7% in the dry season (P < 0.05), and NC and RNT significantly reduced lodging rate in the rainy season. Over the three years, NC and RNT maintained higher maize yields (NC: 10.3 t ha(-1) and RNT: 10.0 t ha(-1)) than CT (9.2 t ha(-1)), and NC had significantly higher yield stability than CT. Meanwhile, NC and RNT had higher precipitation use efficiency (PUE; NC: 21.2 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), RNT: 20.7 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) than NT (20.1 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) or CT (19.1 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). In terms of combined productivity, NC and RNT provide a more suitable soil environment for crop growth and maintain higher yield than NT and CT. NC rotation is recommended as the optimal tillage system for sustainable crop production under semi - arid agricultural conditions. RNT can be extended to areas prone to flooding with abundant rainfall. These results offer a benchmark for future studies on regional maize production under climate change.

Design A cross-sectional survey between September and November 2017. Binary logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between the mental health of people with disability and carers and their exposure to the flood. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. Setting Flood-affected communities in the rural area of Northern Rivers, New South Wales, Australia, 6 months after river flooding in 2017. Participants People over 16 years and a resident in the Northern Rivers at the time of the flood were invited to participate. Using a purposive, snowballing sampling technique participants were drawn from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and had experienced different degrees of flood exposure. Results Of 2252 respondents, there were 164 people with disability and 91 carers. Both groups had increased odds of having their home flooded (people with a disability: OR 2.41 95% CI 1.71 to 3.39; carers: OR 1.76 95% CI 1.10 to 2.84). On evacuation, respondents reported inaccessible, conflicting and confusing information regarding flood warnings. Essential services such as healthcare and social services were disrupted (people with a disability: OR 3.98 95% CI 2.82 to 5.60; carers 2.17 95% CI 1.33 to 3.54) and access to safe and mould free housing post flood event was limited. After taking sociodemographic factors into account, respondents with a disability and carers had greater odds of probable post-traumatic stress disorder compared with other respondents (people with a disability: 3.32 95% CI 2.22 to 4.96; carers: 1.87 95% CI 1.10 to 3.19). Conclusion Our findings show the profound impact and systemic neglect experienced by people with disability and carers during and after the 2017 flood event in the Northern Rivers. As people with disability will take longer to recover, they will require longer-term tailored supports and purposeful inclusion in flood preparedness and recovery efforts.

The need to forecast these extremes and expected future increases in their intensity and frequency motivates a need to better understand the physical processes that connect climate modes to regional precipitation. Focusing on east Australia, where precipitation is driven by multiple interacting climate modes, this study provides a new perspective into the links between large-scale modes of climate variability and precipitation. Using a Lagrangian back-trajectory approach, we examine how El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modifies the supply of evaporative moisture for precipitation, and how this is modulated by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and southern annular mode (SAM). We demonstrate that La Nina modifies large-scale moisture transport together with local thermodynamic changes to facilitate local precipitation generation, whereas below-average precipitation during El Nino stems predominantly from increased regional subsidence. These dynamic-thermodynamic processes were often more pronounced during co-occurring La Nina/negative IOD and El Nino/positive IOD periods. As the SAM is less strongly correlated with ENSO, the impact of co-occurring ENSO and SAM largely depended on the state of ENSO. La Nina-related processes were exacerbated when combined with +SAM and dampened when combined with -SAM, and vice versa during El Nino. This new perspective on how interacting climate modes physically influence regional precipitation can help elucidate how model biases affect the simulation of Australian climate, facilitating model improvement and understanding of regional impacts from long-term changes in these modes. Significance StatementHow climate modes modulate the oceanic and terrestrial sources of moisture for rainfall in east Australia is investigated. East Australia is wetter during La Nina because more moisture is transported into the region and is more easily turned into rainfall when it arrives, whereas drier conditions during El Nino are because local conditions inhibit the conversion of moisture into rainfall. Distant atmospheric changes over the Indian and Southern Oceans can intensify these changes. Our results can be used to better understand and predict the regional impact of long-term changes in these modes of climate variability, which are potentially altered under climate change.

This requires identification of flood layers according to certain characteristics (e.g., texture, geochemical composition, grain-size) and then to count them using naked-eye observation. This method is, however, time-consuming, and intrinsically characterized by a low resolution that may lead to bias and misidentification. To overcome this limitation, high-resolution analytical approaches can be used, such as X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray computed tomography, or hyperspectral imaging (HSI). When coupled with discriminant algorithms, HSI allows for automatic identification of event layers. Here, we propose a new method of flood layers identification and counting based on the combination of both HSI and XRF core scanner analyses, applied to a Lake Bourget (French Alps) sediment sequence. We use a hyperspectral sensor from the short wave-infrared spectral range to create a discrimination model between event layers and continuous sedimentation. This first step allows the estimation of a classification map, with a prediction accuracy of 0.96, and then the automatic reconstruction of a reliable chronicle of event layers (induding their occurrence and deposit thicknesses). XRF signals are then used to discriminate flood layers among all identified event layers based on site-specific geochemical elements (in the case of Lake Bourget: Mn and Ti). This results in an automatically generated flood chronide. Changes in flood occurrence and event thickness through time reconstructed from the automatically generated floods chronicle are in good agreement with the naked-eye-generated chronicle. In detail, differences rely on a larger number of detected flood events (i.e., increase of 9% of the number of layers detected) and a more precise layer thickness estimation, thanks to a higher resolution. Therefore, the developed methodology opens a promising avenue to increase both the efficiency (time-saving) and robustness ( higher accuracy) of paleoflood reconstructions from lake sediments. Also, this methodology can be applied to identify any specific layers (e.g., varve, tephra, mass-movement turbidite, tsunami) and, thereby, it has a direct implication in paleolimnology. paleoflood hydrology and paleoseismology from sediment archives.

The electrical grid is exposed to an increase in fault probability because its infrastructure was designed considering historical frequencies of extreme events occurred in the past. In this respect, to ensure future energy plans and securing services is of great relevance to determine and evaluate the new zones that may be under risk and its relation to critical infrastructures for such extreme events. In this regard, the electrical distribution system is one of the key critical infrastructures since it feeds the others and with the future plans of zero-emissions (leading to the electrification of transport, buildings, renewable energies, etc.) will become even more important in the short term. In this paper, a novel methodology has been developed, able to analyze flood hazard maps quantifying the probability of failure risk of the electrical assets and their potential impacts using a probabilistic approach. Furthermore, a process to monetize the consequences of the yielded risk was established. The whole method developed was applied to the Barcelona and Bristol case study cities. In this way, two different examples of application have been undertaken by using slightly different inputs. Two main inputs were required: (1) the development of accurate GIS hazard flooding models; and (2) the location of the electrical assets (i.e., Distribution Centers (DCs)). To assess and monetize the flood risk to DCs, a variety of variables and tools were required such as water depths (i.e., flood maps), DCs' areas of influence, fragility curves, and damage curves. The analysis was performed for different return periods under different scenarios, current (Baseline) and future (Business As Usual (BAU)) rainfall conditions. The number of DCs affected was quantified and classified into different categories of risk, where up to 363 were affected in Barcelona and 623 in Bristol. Their risk monetization resulted in maximums of 815,700 (sic) in Barcelona and 643,500 (sic) in Bristol. Finally, the percentage of risk increases when considering future rainfall conditions (i.e., BAU) when calculated, resulting in a 2.38% increase in Barcelona and 3.37% increase in Bristol, which in monetary terms would be an average of a 22% increase.

The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC.

The Risk Reduction Benefits of the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal risk; coral reefs; flood risk; environmental degradation; sea-level rise; losses and damages	SEA-LEVEL RISE; WAVE DYNAMICS; CORAL-REEFS; COASTAL; PROTECTION; CLIMATE; ELEVATION; SERVICES; BEACH	Coastal development and climate change are dramatically increasing the risks of flooding, erosion, and extreme weather events. Coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems act as natural defenses against coastal hazards, but their degradation increases risk to people and property. Environmental degradation, however, has rarely been quantified as a driver of coastal risk. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, a region on the Mexican Caribbean coast with an annual tourism economy of 10 billion USD, coral reefs constitute a natural barrier against flooding from hurricanes. This study spatially quantifies the risk reduction benefits of the Mesoamerican Reef in Quintana Roo for people, buildings, and hotel infrastructure. The risk reduction benefits are substantial. For example, the reefs prevented 43% additional damage during Hurricane Dean in (2007) and provide nowadays hazard risk reduction for 4.3% of the people, 1.9% of the built capital, and 2.4% of the hotel infrastructure, per year. The annual benefits are estimated in 4,600 people, 42 million USD damage prevention for buildings, and 20.8 million USD for hotel infrastructure. The study also compares the risk reduction of coral reefs with (i) the protection offered by dunes and (ii) the increase in coastal risk from sealevel rise (SLR). The risk reduction of dunes is more critical where there are no coral reefs offshore and for small return-periods storms. Sea-level rise, however, will make the more frequent storms more impactful and will drive significant increases in annual expected damages across the region. However, we demonstrate that, in coral reef environments, the contribution of reef degradation to coastal risk is larger than the expected increase in risk from SLR. However, the spatial distribution of the risk reduction benefits from reefs differs for people and infrastructure, and in particular for hotels, which receive the most protection from reefs. Furthermore, many sections present larger benefits than the typical costs of restoration. This valuation makes a compelling case for protecting and maintaining this natural infrastructure for its risk reduction service, but also allows the development of piloting innovative strategies, such as risk finance and insurance strategies, that can align environmental and risk management goals.

Sequence stratigraphy and Quaternary depositional systems in the Sanhu area of the Qaidam Basin, northwest China	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						sequence stratigraphy; saline lake; Quaternary; depositional system; Sanhu area; Tibetan Plateau	FORELAND; PALEOGENE; ARCHITECTURE; DEFORMATION; PATTERNS; SUBBASIN	The Qaidam Basin is a Mesozoic-Cenozoic compresso-shearing basin in western China. This basin has been subsiding since the Indosinian orogeny, and the subsidence is a strongly inherited feature in its Quaternary development. Five third-order sequences (SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4 and SQ5) were recognised using drilling/logging, coring and seismic data analysis. Each sequence was further divided into transgressive systems tract and regressive systems tract based on the maximum flooding surface. A sequence stratigraphic framework was established that revealed the distribution of sedimentary systems. Seven depositional systems, namely, alluvial fan, fan delta, braided-delta, shore lacustrine, shallow lacustrine, semi-deep lacustrine and incised valley depositional system, were identified from 105 well logs and 2D seismic lines covering 1600km. The sedimentary system distribution was identified as follows: (1) large-scale alluvial deposit located on the southern slope and adjacent to Kunlun Mountain and Yaber tectonic zone located northeast of the study area; (2) braided-delta deposits southeast of the Sanhu area; (3) widely developed fan-delta sediments on the base of Qigequan Formation in the Yaber tectonic zone; (4) well-deposited shoal lacustrine facies along the depositional strike in the regressive systems tract; (5) widely distributed shallow lacustrine facies; and (6) incised valley with large lateral extension and incision depth as an entity at the front of the Golmud Basin in the Sanhu area. Two different depositional models, namely, east and west models, were built by conducting an integrated analysis of sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary process. In the Sanhu area, the main controlling factors of the sequence architecture and depositional systems associations of the Qigequan Formation are tectonic subsidence and climate change with sediment supply and lake-level fluctuation secondary factors. This case study provides an example of the analyses of sequence stratigraphy and depositional systems in a salinised plateau basin. The approach combines seismic and sedimentary facies analysis to investigate Quaternary deposition and stratigraphy. The low-amplitude tectonic belt on the northern slope and the lithological traps on the southern slope are predicted to be favourable for the lithological gas reservoirs.	[Liu, Z.; Fu, S.; Jia, H.

This is especially relevant in vulnerable arid karstic watersheds, where water resources are scarce but vital for sustaining natural ecosystems and human settlements. However, studies assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrological responses considering land-use changes and precipitation cycles for long periods are rare in karstic environments. In this research, we se-lected a representative karstic watershed in a Mediterranean semiarid domain, since in this belt, karst environments are prone to land degradation processes due to human impacts. Geographic Information Systems-based tools and hy-drological modeling considering daily time steps were combined with temporal analysis of climate variables (wavelet analysis) to demonstrate possible interactions and vulnerable responses. Observed daily flow data were used to cali-brate/validate these hydrological models by applying statistic indicators such as the NSE efficiency and a self-developed index (the ANSE index). This new index could enhance goodness-of-fit measurements obtained with tradi-tional statistics during the model optimization. We hypothesize that this is key to adding new inputs to this research line. Our results revealed that: i) changes in the type of sclerophyllous vegetation (Quercus calliprinos, ilex, rotundifolia, suber, etc.) from 81.5% during the initial stage (1990) to natural grasslands by 81.6% (2018); and, ii) decreases in ag-ricultural areas (crops) by approximately 60% and their transformation into coniferous forests, rock outcrops, sparsely natural grasslands, etc. in the same period. Consequently, increases in the curve number (CN) rates were identified as a result of land abandonment. As a result, an increase in peak flow events jointly with a relevant decrease of the average flow rates (water scarcity) in the watershed was predicted by the HEC-HMS model and verified through the observed data. This research provides useful information about the effects of anthropogenic changes in the hydrodynamicbehaviour of karstic watersheds and water resource impacts, especially key in water-scarce areas that depict important hazards for the water supply of related populations and natural ecosystems.

Primary forest distribution and representation in a Central European landscape: Results of a large-scale field-based census	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forest landscapes; Ecosystem functions; Biodiversity; Habitat loss; Fragmentation; Reserve design	OLD-GROWTH FORESTS; NATURAL DISTURBANCES; TREE REGENERATION; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; COMPLEXITY	Given the global intensification of forest management and climate change, protecting and studying forests that develop free of direct human intervention-also known as primary forests-are becoming increasingly important. Yet, most countries still lack data regarding primary forest distribution. Previous studies have tested remote sensing approaches as a promising tool for identifying primary forests. However, their precision is highly dependent on data quality and resolution, which vary considerably. This has led to underestimation of primary forest abundance and distribution in some regions, such as the temperate zone of Europe. Field-based inventories of primary forests and methodologies to conduct these assessments are inconsistent; incomplete or inaccurate mapping increases the vulnerability of primary forest systems to continued loss from clearing and land-use change. We developed a comprehensive methodological approach for identifying primary forests, and tested it within one of Europe's hotspots of primary forest abundance: the Carpathian Mountains. From 2009 to 2015, we conducted the first national-scale primary forest census covering the entire 49,036 km(2) area of the Slovak Republic. We analyzed primary forest distribution patterns and the representativeness of potential vegetation types within primary forest remnants. We further evaluated the conservation status and extent of primary forest loss. Remaining primary forests are small, fragmented, and often do not represent the potential natural vegetation. We identified 261 primary forest localities. However, they represent only 0.47% of the total forested area, which is 0.21% of the country's land area. The spatial pattern of primary forests was clustered. Primary forests have tended to escape anthropogenic disturbance on sites with higher elevations, steeper slopes, rugged terrain, and greater distances from roads and settlements. Primary forest stands of montane mixed and subalpine spruce forests are more abundant compared to broadleaved forests. Notably, several habitat types are completely missing within primary forests (e.g., floodplain forests). More than 30% of the remaining primary forests are not strictly protected, and harvesting occurred at 32 primary forest localities within the study period. Almost all logging of primary forests was conducted inside of protected areas, underscoring the critical status of primary forest distribution in this part of Europe. Effective conservation strategies are urgently needed to stop the rapid loss and fragmentation of the remaining primary forests. Our approach based on precise, field-based surveys is widely applicable and transferrable to other fragmented forest landscapes.

Advanced modeling assessment and open-source tools are now available to support transparent and rigorous risk evaluation and to inform managers and stakeholders in their choices. However, the issues lay in data availability and data richness to estimate coastal vulnerability and impacts. The Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) has been developed as part of the Resilience Increasing Strategies for Coasts - Toolkit (RISC-KIT) EU FP7 project. The framework provides two levels of analysis. In the first phase, a coastal index approach is applied to identify a restricted number of potential critical areas for different hazards (i.e., erosion and flooding). In the second phase, an integrated hazard and impact modeling approach is applied in the critical areas to assess the direct and indirect impacts of storm events using a matrix-based approach and a systemic analysis. The framework was tested on the coastline of the Emilia-Romagna region (northern Italy) for two probabilistic coastal storms with representative return periods of 10 and 100 years. In this work, the application of the second phase of the CRAF is presented for two sites, Lido degli Estensi-Spina (Ferrara province) and Milano Marittima (Ravenna province). The hazard modeling of floods was implemented using a coupling between XBeach and Lisflood-FP. The Integrated Disruption Assessment (INDRA) model was applied to quantify direct and indirect impacts. The impact assessment focused on household's financial recovery, business disruption and financial recovery, transport network disruption and risk to life. The considered business sector comprised the key economic activities related to the sun-and-beach tourism, which is one of the main drivers of the regional economy. A Multi-Criteria Analysis was applied to support decision-makers to identify the most critical site. The importance of detailed physical and socio-economic data collected at the regional and local levels is highlighted and discussed, together with the importance to involve different stakeholders in the process (e.g., through interviews and surveys). The limitations of the applied approach due to data quality and availability and to the assumptions introduced in the hazard and disruption models are highlighted.

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite Data and Ground-Based Observations (TAMSAT) monthly rainfall dataset for southern Africa by comparing it to two widely used stable global rainfall datasets, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) datasets. Using rainfall records for the period 1984-2010, four statistical measures namely, the correlation coefficient, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), relative bias, mean absolute deviation and the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index were calculated to facilitate pair-wise comparisons. This inter-product comparison study found a good agreement between TAMSAT satellite rainfall and the two global rainfall products with regard to the spatial and temporal representation of monthly rainfall over the region. However, it was found that TAMSAT consistently provides lower monthly rainfall estimates compared to both GPCC and GPCP rainfall estimates over southern Africa. The relative bias between TAMSAT and the two global rainfall products (GPCC and GPCP) was much lower (<= 10%) during the austral summer months (November-March) compared to winter when the relative bias surpassed 70%. These findings indicate TAMSAT is geared more towards convective precipitation brought about by the inter-tropical convergence zone in summer. The observed large discrepancy between TAMSAT estimates and those from two mature global rainfall products during winter raises a key concern regarding the use of TAMSAT as a tool for monitoring rainfall patterns and volumes across the southern reaches of the African continent. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the diminished ability for TAMSAT to "see" non-convective precipitation from frontal systems as well as orographic rainfall due to its reliance upon the observation of the cold cloud duration and convection characteristics of tropical rainfall systems. This calls for the need to further optimise the TAMSAT algorithm using gauge data so that TAMSAT is better able to characterise different precipitation events in those regions where convective rainfall is far from the only major source of rainfall.

These stations are either included in the Bureau of Meteorology's Hydrologic Reference Stations or used in its operational flood forecasting services. Monotonic trend (which is either consistently increasing or decreasing) analyses of the magnitude and timing of flood peaks (estimated using Amax) were performed using the Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall approaches and circular statistics to identify the strength of seasonality and timing. We analysed regional significance across different drainage divisions using the Walker test. Monotonic decreasing trends in Amax flood magnitude were found in the Murray-Darling River Basin and in other drainage divisions in Victoria, southwest and midwest of Western Australia and South Australia. No significant obvious pattern in Amax magnitude was detected in northern Queensland, coastal NSW, central Australia and Tasmania. Monotonic increasing trends were only found in the Tanami-Timor Sea Coast drainage division in northern Australia. Monotonic trends in Amax magnitude were regionally significant at the drainage division scale. We found two distinct patterns in flood seasonality and timing. In the northern and southern parts of Australia, flood peaks generally occur from February to March and August to October, respectively. The strength of this seasonality varies across the country. Weaker seasonality was detected for locations in the Murray-Darling River Basin, and stronger seasonality was evident in northern Australia, the southwest of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The trends of seasonality and timing reveal that in general, flood peaks have occurred later in the water year in recent years. In northern Australia, flood peaks have generally occurred earlier, at a rate of 12 days/decade. In Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, the trends in timing are generally mixed. However, in the southwest of Western Australia, the largest change in timing was evident, with Amax peaks commencing later at a rate of 15 days/decade. Decadal variability in flood timing was found at the drainage division scale as well. Most stations show a decreasing trend in Amax magnitude, but how that trend is associated with the change in timing is not clear.

During rain-on-snow (ROS) events, the structure and properties of the different snow and ice layers dictate the quantity and timing of water flowing out of the snowpack, increasing the risk of flooding and ice jams. With ongoing climate change, a better understanding of the processes and internal properties influencing snowpack outflows is needed to predict the hydrological consequences of winter melting episodes and increases in the frequency of ROS events. This study develops a multi-method approach to monitor the key snowpack properties in a non-mountainous environment in a repeated and non-destructive way. Snowpack evolution during the winter of 2020-2021 was evaluated using a drone-based, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) coupled with photogrammetry surveys conducted at the Ste-Marthe experimental watershed in Quebec, Canada. Drone-based surveys were performed over a 200 m 2 area with a flat and a sloped section. In addition, time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to follow water flow through the snowpack and identify drivers of the changes in snow-pack conditions, as observed in the drone-based surveys. The experimental watershed is equipped with state-of-the-art automatic weather stations that, together with weekly snow pit measurements over the ablation period, served as a reference for the multi-method monitoring approach. Drone surveys conducted on a weekly basis were used to generate georeferenced snow depth, density, snow water equivalent and bulk liquid water content maps. Despite some limitations, the results show that the combination of drone-based GPR, photogrammetric surveys and TDR is very promising for assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of the key hydrological characteristics of the snowpack. For instance, the tested method allowed for measuring marked differences in snow pack behaviour between the first and second weeks of the ablation period. A ROS event that occurred during the first week did not generate significant changes in snow pack density, liquid water content and water equivalent, while another one that happened in the second week of ablation generated changes in all three variables. After the second week of ablation, differences in density, liquid water content (LWC) and snow water equivalent (SWE) between the flat and the sloped sections of the study area were detected by the drone-based GPR measurements. Comparison between different events was made possible by the contact-free nature of the drone-based measurements.

Fidelity of reanalysis datasets in floodplain mapping: Investigating performance at inundation level over large regions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Global hydrodynamic model; Floodplain mapping; Floodplain management; Flood risk; Reanalysis; Runoff	RED-RIVER VALLEY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; ERA-INTERIM; HAZARD; FLOODS; STREAMFLOW; BENEFITS; IMPACTS	Surface runoff estimates from atmospheric reanalysis datasets are increasingly preferred by hydrologists for modeling floods in regions where traditional observations are not sufficiently available. This study explores the fidelity of four widely used reanalyses runoff products from CFSR (6 hourly), ERA-Interim (3 hourly), MERRA (1 hourly), and NARR (3 hourly) as hydraulic forcings to a flood inundation model in describing inundation dynamics over Canada. The reanalysis datasets (duration: 1970 to 2010) are fed to the Catchment-based Macroscale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) global hydrodynamic model, along with other relevant river and floodplain characteristic inputs, to derive high-resolution floodplain maps for 100 and 200-yr return periods. The floodplain maps derived from each reanalysis dataset are compared with the regional developed or 'benchmark floodplain maps' over six selected flood-prone basins (test basins) in Canada through a set of performance statistics. The NARR and ERA-Interim simulated flood maps are found to capture the high and very-high inundation spots fittingly over entire Canada than the remaining reanalysis datasets. While examining inundation dynamics over the six test regions, the NARR simulated floodplain maps are found to capture the majority of inundated areas by exhibiting the highest Hit-Rates between 0.78 and 0.88, and Critical Success Indexes between 0.7 and 0.82. ERA-Interim followed NARR in most of the cases, while CFSR and MERRA did not perform well on several occasions. On the basis of superior performance of NARR, a few historic flood events over the test basins are simulated and subsequently compared with MODIS satellite-derived floodplain information. We notice that more than 75% of the inundation is precisely captured for these events, leaving behind a few spots either due to the presence of a complex terrain and river geometry or due to impacts from other flood drivers such as snow-melt and tide inflow, which are not considered in the present analysis. This study strongly supports the need for careful selection of a reanalysis dataset while performing inundation modeling for large regions. Otherwise, an arbitrary choice may result in larger uncertainties in damage costs, population exposure, and flood risk values during the process. We hope that this study will provide additional insights into floodplain management practices and assist flood modelers and practitioners in a quest for selection of appropriate reanalysis data inputs for floodplain mapping.

Changes in sediment source areas to the Amerasia Basin, Arctic Ocean, over the past 5.5 million years based on radiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb) of detritus from ferromanganese crusts	MARINE GEOLOGY			English	Article							TRACE-ELEMENT; FLOOD BASALTS; NEODYMIUM ISOTOPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-ICE; MENDELEEV; PROVENANCE; MANTLE; RIDGE; WATER	Ferromanganese (FeMn) crusts provide a useful paleoenvironmental archive for studying the poorly understood climatic, oceanographic, and geologic evolution of the Arctic Ocean. This study is based on the identification and temporal reconstruction of sources and inferred transport pathways of terrigenous material in FeMn crusts collected from several sites across the Amerasia Basin. Samples from the Alpha Ridge (AR), Mendeleev Ridge (MR), and Chukchi Borderland (CB) have similar chemical compositions and high detrital contents. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions of the terrigenous detritus extracted from the FeMn crust layers show spatial and temporal variability due to the variable proportions of inputs from the North American and East Siberian margins and local submarine outcrops. The temporal resolution is restricted by macroscopic crust layers, which represent times of significant changes in the depositional environment and are used to study first-order environmental changes. During the period of ca. 4.4 to 3.8 Myr ago, detritus in the MR area was derived mostly from the Laptev Sea. Then, until about 1.3 Myr ago, FeMn crusts from MR received a higher volcanic component sourced from the East Siberian Sea, with mixing of detritus from the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt (OCVB) area and possibly weathering of local MR outcrops, which is mostly High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP) rocks. The period from about 1.3 Myr ago to the present reflects enhanced contributions of detritus from the Canadian Shield, approximately equal to the East Siberian contribution for the MR area. CB crusts show three main periods of distinct detrital input. During the period ca. 5.5-5.0 Myr ago, CB detritus was sourced from local submarine outcrops of the JurassicCretaceous HALIP rocks and possibly from northeast Siberia, including OCVB rocks, while during the period from about 5.0 to 3.6 Myr ago, the CB FeMn crusts had a much greater input of detritus from the North American margin. After 3.6 Myr ago, the CB detritus shows a mixed composition predominantly sourced from North America with some material transported from the Bering Sea and smaller contributions from northeast Siberia. The AR crust was influenced mostly by detritus sourced from the Canadian Shield. This study shows that FeMn crusts from the Arctic ocean are a useful tool and archive for climate reconstruction and depositional history of this polar region.

J	Wrzesinski, D; Sobkowiak, L				Wrzesinski, Dariusz; Sobkowiak, Leszek			Transformation of the Flow Regime of a Large Allochthonous River in Central Europe-An Example of the Vistula River in Poland	WATER			English	Article						Vistula River basin; flow regime; variability; pentadic Parde's coefficient of flow; uncertainty; stability; hydrological periods; cluster analysis	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; RUNOFF; CLASSIFICATION; WORLD	Identification of river flow regime and its possible changes caused by natural factors or human activity is one of major issues in modern hydrology. In such studies different approaches and different indicators can be used. The aim of this study is to determine changes in flow regime of the largest river in Poland the Vistula, using new, more objectified coefficients and indices, based on data recorded in 22 gauges on the Vistula mainstream and 38 gauges on its tributaries in the multi-year period 1971-2010. The paper consists of three main parts: in the first part, in order to recognize changes in the flow regime characteristics along the Vistula, data from gauges located on the river mainstream were analyzed with the help of the theory of entropy. In the second part gauging stations on the Vistula mainstream and its tributaries were grouped; values of the newly introduced pentadic Parde's coefficient of flow (discharge) (PPC) were taken as the grouping criterion. In the third part of the study a novel method of determining river regime characteristics was applied: through the recognition of the temporal structure of hydrological phenomena and their changes in the annual cycle sequences of hydrological periods (characteristic phases of the hydrological cycle) on the Vistula River mainstream and its tributaries were identified and their occurrence in the yearly cycle was discussed. Based on the detected changes of the 73 -pentad Parde's coefficients of flow four main types of rivers were distinguished. Transformation of the flow regime was reflected in the identified different sequences of hydrological periods in the average annual cycle. It was found that while transformation of the Vistula River regime occurred along its whole course, the most frequent changes were detected in its upper, mountainous reaches, under the influence of the flow characteristics of its tributaries. This allowed the Vistula to be considered the allochthonous river. These findings are interesting not only from a theoretical point of view, but they also can be valuable to stakeholders in the field of the Vistula River basin water management and hydrological forecasting, including flood protection, which has recently become a matter of growing concern due to the observed effects of climate change and human impact.

The largest ice-dammed lake had a volume of similar to 224 km(3) and formed in a late stage of the first Saalian ice advance (MIS 6) in central Germany. The failure of the ice dam in the bedrock-outlet channel triggered a major glacial lake-outburst flood. Flood-related erosional and depositional features include large-scale scours, trench-like channels, streamlined hills, giant bars and run-up deposits, indicating a wide spreading of the outburst flood in an early stage and the incision of trench-like valleys in a later stage. The incision of large valleys in the proximal flood pathway strongly impacted the regional drainage system by providing an efficient drainage network. The trench-like channels initiated by the lake-outburst flood became a crucial part of the ice-marginal drainage and subsequent fluvial system. The reconstructed outlet hydrographs imply peak discharges of 465,000-673,000 m(3)s(-1). The numerical simulation indicates flow depths of up to 87 m, flow velocities of up to 7 ms(-1), peaks of the bed shear stress of 2500 Nm(-2) and the inundation of large parts of northwestern Germany and the northern Netherlands. The numerical simulation of the outburst flood was conducted on both the modem digital elevation model and on palaeotopographic models, representing the palaeotopography prior to the outburst flood and during maximum flood-related incision, respectively. Distally, the outburst flood probably followed an east-west trending route through northwestern Germany and the central Netherlands into the ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea Basin. The added water volume might have led to the overspill and drainage of the proglacial lakes in the central Netherlands and the North Sea Lake in a chain reaction, eventually opening an east-west trending meltwater-drainage pathway along the southwestern margin of the decaying ice sheet.

Recent inorganic carbon increase in a temperate estuary driven by water quality improvement and enhanced by droughts	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							BACTERIAL PRODUCTION; ELBE ESTUARY; ORGANIC-MATTER; EXTREME FLOOD; FRESH-WATER; RIVER; ALKALINITY; SYSTEM; DYNAMICS; DIOXIDE	Estuaries are an important contributor to the global carbon budget, facilitating carbon removal, transfer, and transformation between land and the coastal ocean. Estuaries are susceptible to global climate change and anthropogenic perturbations. We find that a long-term significant mid-estuary increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of 6-21 mu mol kg - 1 yr - 1 (1997-2020) in a temperate estuary in Germany (Elbe Estuary) was driven by an increase in upper-estuary particulate organic carbon (POC) content of 8-14 mu mol kg - 1 yr - 1 . The temporal POC increase was due to an overall improvement in water quality observed in the form of high rates of primary production and a significant drop in biological oxygen demand. The magnitude of mid-estuary DIC gain was equivalent to the increased POC production in the upper estuary, suggesting that POC is effectively remineralized and retained as DIC in the mid-estuary, with the estuary acting as an efficient natural filter for POC. In the context of this significant long-term DIC increase, a recent extended drought period (2014-2020) significantly lowered the annual mean river discharge (468 +/- 234 m 3 s - 1 ) compared to the long-term mean (690 +/- 441 m 3 s - 1 , 1960-2020), while the late spring internal DIC load in the estuary doubled. The drought induced a longer dry season, starting in May (earlier than normal), increased the residence time in the estuary and allowed for a more complete remineralization period of POC. Annually, 77 %-94 % of the total DIC export was laterally transported to the coastal waters, reaching 89 +/- 4.8 Gmol C yr - 1 , and thus, between 1997 and 2020, only an estimated maximum of 23 % (10 Gmol C yr - 1 ) was released via carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) evasion. Export of DIC to coastal waters decreased significantly during the drought, on average by 24 % (2014-2020: 38 +/- 5.4 Gmol C yr - 1 ), compared to the non-drought period. In contrast, there was no change in the water-air CO 2 flux during the drought. We have identified that seasonal changes in DIC processing in an estuary require consideration when estimating both the long-term and future changes in water-air CO 2 flux and DIC export to coastal waters. Regional and global carbon budgets should therefore take into account carbon cycling estimates in estuaries, as well as their changes over time in relation to impacts of water quality changes and extreme hydrological events.

Adaptation constraints and prospects for future research priorities in lowland rice-based farming systems: learning experiences from Northwest Cambodia	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Cambodia; Paddy smallholder farmers; Cropping production systems; Production constraints and limitations; Sustainable productivity and profitability	CLOSING YIELD GAPS; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; HOUSEHOLD INCOME; DECISION-MAKING; WATER-USE; IMPACTS; DETERMINANTS; ADOPTION	Sustainable agricultural development not only addresses global food insecurity but may also alleviate poverty by enriching the lives of millions of smallholder farmers. Improving the sustainability and profitability of agriculture where smallholders are dominant creates profound impacts because small landholding farmers produce approximately 70-80% of the global food. The need for a thorough understanding of the factors affecting farmers' adoption of agricultural technologies and practices has been identified from extant literature as an important research gap. Responding to the research gap and need, this study examined the challenges that prevent farm households from adopting improved farming practices and/or technologies in Banteay Meanchey and Battambang provinces in Northwest Cambodia. A total of 524 rice producing farm household representatives were randomly selected from a household database maintained by the local government authorities. A mixed methods approach was used in the study including semi-structured interviews followed by in-depth interviews, field observations, and literature review. Farmers were found to be confronted with a range of challenges and concerns, including soil degradation, weeds, diseases, insect pests, high production costs, flooding, droughts, changing rainfall pattern, and unreliable rainfall distribution. The research findings demonstrate that improved crop production practices (e.g., adopting mechanised direct seeding methods of crop establishment, maintaining and improving soil health through crop residue retention, growing cover crops, etc.) and better resource use efficiency (e.g., reducing seeding rates to less than 100 kg/ha, being more strategic in the use of integrated nutrient, weed, and pest management strategies, etc.) can be a starting point for sustainable intensification of rice production. This transition towards intensifying paddy production sustainably may become even more effective through a clear understanding of local contexts, farm household characteristics, available resources, and the farm management practices and constraints. We observed that farmers and their associations have yet to be fully recognised as partners and actors in Cambodia. Instead, they tend to be viewed as beneficiaries and recipients of improved practices and technologies. We, therefore, propose that farmers and their associations be acknowledged and included in a process of co-creation of knowledge-practices. Such partnerships will enable the inclusion of factors (e.g., production costs, production risks, complexity and practicability of implementations, product market and prices, etc.) shown to influence farmers' adoption of innovative farming practices and technologies. The original contribution of this article is a real-world account of the constraints and limitations experienced by smallholder rice farmers in Cambodia, which are connected to future research and development priorities in the region.

The results show distinct patterns of responses to the different stresses and their combinations, but also a natural genetic variation in the strength of these responses. This includes novel results regarding the lack of a response to drought after submergence and a decoupling between leaf number and flowering time after submergence. Plant responses to abiotic stresses are complex and dynamic, and involve changes in different traits, either as the direct consequence of the stress, or as an active acclimatory response. Abiotic stresses frequently occur simultaneously or in succession, rather than in isolation. Despite this, most studies have focused on a single stress and single or few plant traits. To address this gap, our study comprehensively and categorically quantified the individual and combined effects of three major abiotic stresses associated with climate change (flooding, progressive drought and high temperature) on 12 phenotypic traits related to morphology, development, growth and fitness, at different developmental stages in four Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Combined sublethal stresses were applied either simultaneously (high temperature and drought) or sequentially (flooding followed by drought). In total, we analysed the phenotypic responses of 1782 individuals across these stresses and different developmental stages. Overall, abiotic stresses and their combinations resulted in distinct patterns of effects across the traits analysed, with both quantitative and qualitative differences across accessions. Stress combinations had additive effects on some traits, whereas clear positive and negative interactions were observed for other traits: 9 out of 12 traits for high temperature and drought, 6 out of 12 traits for post-submergence and drought showed significant interactions. In many cases where the stresses interacted, the strength of interactions varied across accessions. Hence, our results indicated a general pattern of response in most phenotypic traits to the different stresses and stress combinations, but it also indicated a natural genetic variation in the strength of these responses. This includes novel results regarding the lack of a response to drought after submergence and a decoupling between leaf number and flowering time after submergence. Overall, our study provides a rich characterization of trait responses of Arabidopsis plants to sublethal abiotic stresses at the phenotypic level and can serve as starting point for further in-depth physiological research and plant modelling efforts.

J	Gusarov, AV				Gusarov, Artem V.			The impact of contemporary changes in climate and land use/cover on tendencies in water flow, suspended sediment yield and erosion intensity in the northeastern part of the Don River basin, SW European Russia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Soil erosion; Small catchment; Sedimentation; Caesium-137; Soil freezing; Snowmelt runoff; Flood; East European Plain	SOIL-EROSION; FOREST-STEPPE; COVER CHANGES; RAINFALL EROSIVITY; LOESS PLATEAU; FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CHANNEL INCISION; GULLY EROSION; SOUTHERN HALF	The basin of the Don River (the fifth longest river in Europe), located mainly in the forest-steppe and steppe landscape zones, is one of the most populated and agriculturally developed regions of the East European (Russian) Plain. Sheet, rill and gully erosion occurring chiefly in snowmelt period (March-April) and also in moderate-to-heavy-rainfalls season (chiefly May-to-September) is the main factor of present-day soil degradation within cultivated lands of this basin. Using monitoring hydrological data, it is shown, by the examples of the Khopyor River and the Medveditsa River flowing in the northeastern part of the Don River basin (SW European Russia), that suspended sediment yield of the rivers, as an objective and sufficiently accurate indicator of total erosion intensity in river basins, was reduced by 3.6-3.8 times between the 1960s-1970s and 2008-2015. This conclusion is consistent with change in sedimentation rates (using Cs-137 as a chronomarker) within one of the small catchments located in the basin of the upper reaches of the Medveditsa River. The noted dynamics in erosion intensity and suspended sediment yields took place against the background of a well-marked tendency (since the 1940s-1960s) of reduction in intra-annual unevenness of river water flow caused by a decrease in spring (snowmelt-induced, March-April) flood water flow, and by a more significant increase in water discharges during low-water-flow periods of year (winter (December-to-February) and river-ice-free period (mid-April-to-November)). These changes were accompanied by an increase in duration of spring (snowmelt-induced) flood flow with a reduction in its intensity, year-to-year anomalousness and contribution to total annual water flow of the rivers. The main reasons for all the changes noted over the last decades were climate change (a decrease in depth of soil freezing during snowmelt period caused by an increase in air temperature mainly in winter and spring months; an increase in winter thaws frequency) and human activity changes (mainly a reduction in cultivated land area, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s). The similar tendencies were identified over the last decades in other regions of the forest (south part), forest-steppe and steppe landscape zones of the East European Plain.

Especially for low-lying coastal areas including the Kuala Kedah area which is active in agricultural and fisheries activities. Farmers have had to bear up to 75 % of yield losses due to seawater breaches since 2016. Therefore, this study is designed to assess the im-pact of seawater encroachment on water quality through spatial technology approaches and hydrodynamic modeling related to the growth of paddy trees. The study was conducted during two different paddy cultivation seasons namely Season 1-2019 and Season 2-2019 which take place in the southwest and northeast monsoon in Kuala Kedah, Malaysia. The study involved three phases, which are the assessment of salinity and pH concentration levels, the as-sessment of the health of paddy crops through multispectral image analysis involving three plant indices (VI), namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI) and Normal-ized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), and finally, the assessment of the impact of SLR through the numerical method in MIKE 21 for hydrodynamic modeling considering two conditions that are without mitigation factor (K1) and with existing mitigating factor (K2). According to the findings, the salinity concentration trend is decreasing across the growth stage during Season 1-2019, whereas it is the contrary during Season 2-2019. It was discovered that during the study period for both tidal events, 73 % of the 44 sampling points in Season 1-2019, as opposed to just 3 % in Sea-son 2-2019, were categorized as Class 4 and Class 5. Even though there were fluctuations throughout the observation, the pH reading is still within the allowed range of 6.5 to 9.0 for the estuary area. Following that, the ANOVA analysis proved that salinity concentration a statistically significant difference with tidal variations and pH levels. Moreover, the multispectral image analysis findings revealed that the VI value was correlated with both the yield and the health of the rice crop, with R-square values of 0.842 compared to 0.706 and 0.575 for NDVI and BNDVI values, respectively. It confirmed that NDRE granted a more accurate and reliable measurements. Additionally, the hydrodynamic simula-tion results demonstrated that, if the mitigation factors were considered in the modeling, overflow seawater to the mainland could be reduced by up to 20 %, reducing the impact of coastal flooding on the local area as well as the nearby rice cultivation area. Ultimately, these three elements-water quality, vegetation index, and hydrodynamic modeling-can assist in identifying the underlying cause of the problem and develop short and long-term solutions.

Thus, reliable projections of such events in the future are needed. To provide high-resolution projections under the RCP8.5 scenario for HPEs at the end of the 21st century, and to understand the changes in sub-hourly to daily rainfall patterns, weather research and forecasting (WRF) model simulations of 41 historic HPEs in the eastern Mediterranean are compared with "pseudo global warming" simulations of the same events. This paper presents the changes in rainfall patterns in future storms, decomposed into storms' mean conditional rain rate, duration, and area. A major decrease in rainfall accumulation (-30% averaged across events) is found throughout future HPEs. This decrease results from a substantial reduction of the rain area of storms (-40%) and occurs despite an increase in the mean conditional rain intensity (+15%). The duration of the HPEs decreases (-9%) in future simulations. Regionally maximal 10-min rain rates increase (+22%), whereas over most of the region, long-duration rain rates decrease. The consistency of results across events, driven by varying synoptic conditions, suggests that these changes have low sensitivity to the specific synoptic evolution during the events. Future HPEs in the eastern Mediterranean will therefore likely be drier and more spatiotemporally concentrated, with substantial implications on hydrological outcomes of storms. Plain Language Summary Heavy precipitation events are large storms that can recharge freshwater reservoirs, but can also lead to hazardous outcomes such as flash floods. Therefore, understanding the impacts of climate change on such storms is critical. Here, a weather model similar to those used in weather forecasts is used to simulate heavy precipitation events in the eastern Mediterranean. A large collection of storms is simulated in pairs: (a) historic storms, selected for their high impact, and (b) the same storms placed in a global warming scenario projected for the end of the 21st century. Using these simulations we ask how present-day storms would look like were they to occur at the warmer end of the 21st century. The future storms are found to produce much less rainfall compared to their historic counterparts. This decrease in rainfall is attributed mainly to the reduction in the area covered by storms' rainfall, and happens despite increasing rainfall intensities. These results suggest that the region will be drier in the future with larger dry areas during storms; however, over short durations, it would rain more intensely over contracted areas-increasing local hazards associated with heavy precipitation events.

As a result, the stratigraphic interpretation of the sediments of the lower part of the first above floodplain terrace of the Belaya River is corrected and they are assigned to the Tabulda Horizon (MIS 3) of the Upper Pleistocene in the regional scheme of the Fore-Urals Quaternary. The malacofauna of the locality is represented by 27 species of terrestrial and freshwater molluscs. The composition of molluscs in the deposits of MIS 3 indicates the succession of deposit accumulation in the river valley from the stage of reservoirs that periodically connecting with the river to the stage of the overgrown oxbow lake. Single occur-rence of mollusc shells in the loams of MIS 2 is a result of sharp climate change. New insect material includes 136 species of Coleoptera from 17 families, as well as Heteroptera and Hymenoptera representatives. 29 species of beetles (Carabidae, Histeridae, Scarabaeidae, Elateridae, Tenebrionidae, Chrysomelidae, Brentidae and Curcu-lionidae) are recorded for the Pleistocene for the first time. The insect assemblages from Gornovo site are assigned to periglacial and humid boreal faunal types. The entomofauna of the periglacial type has no analogues in the recent fauna; it corresponds to the deposits assigned to the middle of MIS 3. This entomofauna is char-acteristic to the MIS 2 and MIS 3 insect assemblages from the south of West Siberian Plain. Based on entomo-logical data, the climate of the middle of MIS 3 of the Southern Fore-Urals is reconstructed as dry and cold, extracontinental, with mean July temperature not exceeding +15 C. Steppe landscapes likely prevailed in open areas and coniferous forests were restricted to river valleys. Beetles from deposits dated to end of MIS 3 are assigned to the fauna of the boreal humid type. These insect assemblages are significantly poorer in diversity than periglacial type assemblages and are represented mainly by near water and forest Coleoptera. Based on these species, meadow and forest landscapes were reconstructed. The reconstructed mean air temperature of July ranged from +16 to +19 ?. This suggests a trend towards more mild conditions in the region connected to the climate warming at the end of MIS 3. It is likely that humidification during this period was regional, determined by the proximity of the site to the Southern Urals Mountains.

J	Bürger, G; Pfister, A; Bronstert, A				Buerger, Gerd; Pfister, Angela; Bronstert, Axel			Increasing intensity of heavy rainfall caused by global warming: data analysis and future projections	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG			German	Article						heavy rainfall; short duration; global warming; Clausius-Clapeyron equation; precipitation intensity; multiplicative cascade model	TIME-SCALE; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; DISAGGREGATION; BRAUNSBACH; GENERATION; EXTREMES; EVENT; MODEL	Extreme rainfall events of short duration in the range of hours and below are increasingly coming into focus due to the resulting damage from flash floods and also due to their possible intensification by anthropogenic climate change. The current study investigates possible trends in heavy rainfall intensities for stations from Swiss and Austrian alpine regions as well as for the Emscher-Lippe area in North Rhine-Westphalia on the basis of partly very long (> 50 years) and temporally highly resolved time series (<= 15 minutes). It becomes clear that there is an increase in extreme rainfall intensities, which can be well explained by the warming of the regional climate: the analyses of long-term trends in exceedance counts and return levels show considerable uncertainties, but are in the order of 30 % increase per century. In addition, based on an "average" climate simulation for the 21st century, this paper describes a projection for extreme precipitation intensities at very high temporal resolution for a number of stations in the Emscher-Lippe region. A coupled spatial and temporal "downscaling" is applied, the key innovation of which is the consideration of the dependence of local rainfall intensity on air temperature. This procedure involves two steps: First, large-scale climate fields at daily resolution are statistically linked by regression to station temperature and precipitation values (spatial downscaling). In the second step, these station values are disaggregated to a temporal resolution of 10 minutes using a so-called multiplicative stochastic cascade model (MC) (temporal downscaling). The novel, temperature-sensitive variant additionally considers air temperature as an explanatory variable for precipitation intensities. Thus, the higher atmospheric moisture content expected with warming, which results from the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship, is included in the temporal downscaling. For the statistical evaluation of the extreme short-term precipitation, the upper quantiles (99.9 %), exceedance counts (P > 5mm), and 3-yr return levels of the <= 15-min duration step has been used. Only by adding temperature is the observed temperature observed of the extreme quantiles ("CC scaling") well reproduced. When comparing observed data and present-day simulations of the model cascade, the temperature-sensitive procedure shows consistent results. Compared to trends in recent decades, similar or even larger increases in extreme intensities are projected for the future. This is remarkable in that these appear to be driven primarily by local temperature, as the projected trends in daily precipitation values are negligible for this region.

Being one of the longest and largest dune systems in Europe, this iconic landscape offers considerable services to coastal societies. Since the mid-half of the 18th century, human work on sediment flows has resulted in the emergence of large sets of foredunes, currently constituting an almost 230 km-long managed barrier against inland sand invasion, coastline erosion, coastal flooding and also a major reserve of bio-diversity. Last massive mechanic shaping of the foredunes following a so-called "ideal profile" date back to the 1970s-80s and aimed to limit erosion dynamics and sediment mobility. Since, they have been facing multiples disruptions over the years which have considerably modified their morphology, especially during the last decades. Calibrated foredunes are currently exhibiting impressive dimensions with a mean dune height of about 16.6 m (peaking at >30 m in some locations) and a dune width mean along the coast of 187 m. Today, 55.5% of them meet the "ideal profile" shape standards or surpass the in terms of dimensions whereas 21,5% of the calibrated foredunes are considered "narrowed" and need specific attention. This regional analysis, based on extensive airborne LiDAR datasets from 2011 to 2018, includes (i) a dune morphology classification based on several basic geomorphological indicators (dune width, height, crest position, back dune elevation) compared to a calibrated "idealised" shaped profile, (ii) a quantification of marine beach-dune and aeolian sediments flows (in m/year and m/m(2)/year) and forms on dunes (scarps, blowouts, depositional lobes), as an indicator of the recent dynamics affecting dunemorphology and (iii) a study of management control of calibrated foredunes (4613 interventions) including actions taken after the outstanding winter of 2013-2014. As expected, intensive dune management are mainly focused where assets are directly threatened. The study highlights the importance and the efficiency of human management on dune evolutions (long term dune form stability, control of gullies and incipient frontal blowout after marine erosion, protection of human issues). However, today management actions (wind fence, branch cover, planting and reshaping) are not conditioned by foredune morphology or last decade's beach-dune dynamic (sediment availability, chronic coastline erosion). Considering long-term-erosion projections and expected impact of climate change, the analysis shows the need of more global and extensive strategies in order to preserve the protection role of foredunes in the coming decades.

Tide Gauge Records Show That the 18.61-Year Nodal Tidal Cycle Can Change High Water Levels by up to 30cm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Nodal Modulation; Extreme Sea Levels; Tide Gauges; Harmonic Analysis	EXTREME SEA LEVELS; STORM-SURGE; RISE; ADAPTATION; FREQUENCY; IMPACT	The lunar nodal cycle, produced by the varying declination of the Moon over a period of 18.61years, drives changes in tidal amplitude globally. However, constraining the range of changes in tidal amplitude that can be expected over a nodal cycle from real observations is rarely considered for coastal hazard planning. In this study, we use hourly tide gauge observations with record lengths >19years from 574 stations distributed worldwide to examine the contribution of the nodal modulation to monthly high water levels. Our results show that the influence of the lunar nodal cycle on high water levels is largest at tide gauge stations located in the Gulf of Tonkin, English Channel, and Bristol Channel, amounting up to 30cm in range, suggesting that in the coming decades the impact of the nodal cycle on high water levels in those regions could be greater than that of global mean sea level rise, which is up to 17cm by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report projections. We also examine the phase of nodal modulation and show that the estimated phases exhibit two clusters: one cluster (111 degrees +/- 10 degrees) corresponds with the locations having a diurnal form of tides, whereas the other cluster (-59 degrees +/- 11 degrees) corresponds with the locations exhibiting a semidiurnal form of tides. Nodal modulation in the diurnal and semidiurnal locations will peak again in 2025 and 2034, respectively, resulting in enhanced potential for coastal hazard in the respective regions. Plain Language Summary Nodal modulation is slow variation of the amplitude of diurnal or semidiurnal ocean tides associated with relative motions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun over a period of 18.61 years. It is an important contributor to extreme sea levels and can increase the risk of coastal flooding at specific, forecastable times. We use hourly tide gauge observations from 574 stations distributed worldwide to estimate and map the contribution of the 18.61- year lunar nodal modulation to monthly high water levels. We find that nodal modulation has the largest influence on the monthly highest water levels at locations in the Gulf of Tonkin, in the Bristol Channel, and in the English Channel, amounting up to 30 cm in range, and the nodal modulation in the diurnal and semidiurnal locations will peak again in 2025 and 2034, respectively, with the potential for high levels of coastal hazard in the respective regions.

J	Sun, C; Xiao, ZN; Nguyen, M				Sun Chang; Xiao Zi-Niu; Minh Nguyen			Projection on precipitation frequency of different intensities and precipitation amount in the Lancang-Mekong River basin in the 21st century	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Precipitation projection; Lancang-Mekong River basin; Precipitation frequency; Precipitation amount; Precipitation intensity	EXTREME DAILY RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY	In the Lancang-Mekong River basin (LMRB), agriculture, dominating the local economy, faces increasing challenges in water supply under climate change. The projection of future precipitation in this basin is essential for understanding the challenges. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to project the LMRB precipitation. Comparing with the historical period (1986-2005), we analyzed the changes of both the projected precipitation amount and the frequency of rainless (<0.1 mm d(-1)), light rain (0.1-10 mm d(-1)), moderate rain (10-25 mm d(-1)), heavy rain (25-50 mm d(-1)), rainstorm (50-100 mm d(-1)), and heavy rainstorm (>100 mm d(-1)) for three periods, namely the near-term (2016-2035), mid-term (2046-2065), and long-term (2080-2099). The results indicate that the precipitation amount during the wet season (April-October) is expected to increase in most areas of the basin for the three periods. As for the precipitation during the dry season (November-March), an increase is projected in most areas for the near-term, while an increase in the lower reach of the basin and a decrease in the upper and middle reach for the mid-term and long-term. The precipitation reduction is expected to be greatest in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Yunnan province of China for the mid-term. The frequency of precipitation in different intensities has prominent regional and temporal differences. During the wet season, the days of rainless and light rain are expected to decrease in the middle reach, whereas the days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm increase. This feature is especially strong in southern Thailand, southern Laos and Cambodia in the near-term and in Laos and Thailand for the mid-term and long-term. During the dry season, there are projected increasing rainless days and decreasing days of precipitation for the other intensities in the middle reach, and opposite in the rest area of the basin. These projected precipitation changes have potential various impact in different parts of the basin. The middle reach would likely face increasing flood risks because of more days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm, as well as more precipitation. Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos would probably be the center of drought threatens during the dry season due to the increment of rainless days and the precipitation reduction. Besides, the seawater intrusion during the dry season in the near-term and mid-term would be more serious as a result of the precipitation decrease in southern Vietnam.

J	Brain, RA; Anderson, JC				Brain, Richard A.; Anderson, Julie C.			Anthropogenic factors affecting wildlife species status outcomes: why the fixation on pesticides?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Review; Early Access						Pesticides; Anthropogenic factors; Wildlife; Species status outcomes	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; LAND-USE CHANGE; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; SMALL MAMMALS; FOREST TRANSITION; NORTH-AMERICA; BIODIVERSITY; BRUCELLOSIS; AGRICULTURE; PATTERNS	Most Americans are at least three generations removed from the farm, thereby at least three generations removed from the reality of where their food comes from. Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the "first proto-farmers," humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies "developed," and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of "agriculture" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to "pesticides" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.

Analysis of Organic Matter Decomposition in the Salt Marshes of the Venice Lagoon (Italy) Using Standard Litter Bags	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						salt marshes; organic matter; litter decomposition; litter bag experiment; tea bag index	SOIL CARBON DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; COASTAL WETLANDS; TIDAL WETLANDS; WIND-WAVES; CLIMATE; RATES; VEGETATION; ACCRETION	Tidal salt marshes are widespread along the World's coasts, and are ecologically and economically important as they provide several valuable ecosystem services. In particular, their significant primary production, coupled with sustained vertical accretion rates, enables marshes to sequester and store large amounts of organic carbon and makes them one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth. Organic carbon accumulation results from the balance between inputs, that is, organic matter produced by local plants or imported, and outputs through decomposition and erosion. Additionally, organic matter deposition actively contributes to marsh vertical accretion, thus critically affecting the resilience of marsh ecosystems to rising relative sea levels. A better understanding of organic-matter dynamics in salt marshes is key to address salt-marsh conservation issues and to elucidate marsh importance within the global carbon cycle. Toward this goal, we empirically derived rates of organic matter decomposition by burying 712 commercially available tea bags at different marshes in the microtidal Venice Lagoon (Italy), and by analyzing them following the Tea Bag Index protocol. We find values of the decomposition rate (k) and stabilization factor (S) equal to 0.012 +/- 0.003 days(-1) and 0.15 +/- 0.063, respectively. Water temperature critically affects organic matter decomposition, enhancing decomposition rates by 8% per degrees C on average. We argue that, at least in the short term, the amount of undecomposed organic matter that actively contributes to carbon sequestration and marsh vertical accretion strongly depends on the initial organic matter quality, which is a function of marsh and vegetation characteristics. Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are important coastal environments regularly flooded by the tide and dominated by herbaceous plants, providing several valuable ecosystem services. They are, however, threatened by the effects of climate changes and human interferences. As organic matter accumulated in salt-marsh soil importantly contribute to surface elevation necessary for marshes to keep up with sea level rise and to store atmospheric carbon, this project aims to improve our understanding of decomposition processes affecting organic matter preservation and their controls in salt-marsh environment. Toward this goal, following the so-called Tea Bag Index protocol, we buried 712 commercially available tea bags in salt-marsh soils of the Venice Lagoon (Italy) measuring the reduction of their organic content due to decomposition processes after 3 months. Our results confirm that salt marshes are among biomes with the slowest decomposition rates. However, we observed a loss of about two-thirds of the initial labile organic mass after 90 days and that initial litter quality, depending on litter and vegetation characteristics, exerts a primary control on the amount of preserved organic matter contributing to carbon sequestration and marsh accretion.

The Influence of Drying on the Aeolian Transport of River-Sourced Sand	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						eolian; sediment transport; hydrology; water; moisture; dune	COLORADO-RIVER; GRAND-CANYON; WIND EROSION; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; SUPPLY LIMITATION; CONTROLLED FLOODS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DUST EMISSIONS; YELLOW-RIVER; PI-SWERL	Transgression and regression of water levels (stages) have impacted the evolution of aeolian landforms and sedimentary deposits throughout geologic history. We studied this phenomenon over a 5-day period of reduced flow on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park, AZ, USA, in March 2021. These transient low flows exposed river-channel sand deposits to the air, causing progressive desiccation (drying) and thereby making these deposits susceptible to aeolian transport. We measured aeolian threshold friction velocities (u(*t)) for sand saltation and PM10 dust emissions, as well as other characteristics, on a subaerially exposed sandbar and downwind aeolian dunefield during each day of the low river flow. The sandbar transitioned from supply-limited to transport-limited aeolian sediment transport conditions during the regression in river water stage. A possible tipping point between the two transport conditions occurred approximately 48 hr after the drop in river flow. The empirically measured u(*t) decreased as the sandbar sediment dried with increased subaerial exposure time. Theoretical estimates and empirical measurements of u(*t) corresponded closely on the aeolian dunefield and on the sandbar when it was drier during the third and fourth day of the experiment. Eighty-seven percent of the variability in u(*t) was explained by empirical models that provide practical estimates of aeolian transport potential of subaerial river sediment deposits using monitoring data that are commonly available in this and other river systems. The work provides theoretical insight into the response of aeolian processes to sediment supply changes driven by periods of anthropogenic activity, drought, and climate change. Plain Language Summary Along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park, windblown river sand provides important wildlife habitat, sandy areas for camping, and a protective cover for archeological sites but has decreased since construction of the upstream Glen Canyon Dam. One river management tool for increasing windblown sand is to release artificial "floods" from the dam to deposit sand above the level of typical river flows so it can be redistributed by wind. An alternative approach could be to lower river flows and expose sand that is usually underwater, allowing it to dry sufficiently to be moved by wind. Here we examine whether reducing flows to a low level (stage) for 5 days increases windblown sand. We learned that 48 hr after water stage dropped, a formerly wet sandbar had dried sufficiently so that wind speed, rather than dry sand abundance, had become the main factor limiting the amount of windblown sand. After 72 hr, the ability of wind to transport sand from the previously submerged sandbar was equivalent to an adjacent sand dune that was never inundated. These results show that low steady flows combined with wind offer an alternative to flooding for maintaining sandy landscapes in river valleys.

A Review of the Current State and Recent Changes of the Andean Cryosphere	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Review						glaciers; mountain permafrost; seasonal snow; Andes Cordillera; tropical Andes; southern Andes	SOUTHERN PATAGONIA ICEFIELD; SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; RECENT GLACIER VARIATIONS; DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS; EQUILIBRIUM-LINE ALTITUDE; LAKE OUTBURST FLOOD; SEA-LEVEL RISE; NEVADO ICE CAP; ROCK GLACIERS; NORTHERN PATAGONIA	The Andes Cordillera contains the most diverse cryosphere on Earth, including extensive areas covered by seasonal snow, numerous tropical and extratropical glaciers, and many mountain permafrost landforms. Here, we review some recent advances in the study of the main components of the cryosphere in the Andes, and discuss the changes observed in the seasonal snow and permanent ice masses of this region over the past decades. The open access and increasing availability of remote sensing products has produced a substantial improvement in our understanding of the current state and recent changes of the Andean cryosphere, allowing an unprecedented detail in their identification and monitoring at local and regional scales. Analyses of snow cover maps has allowed the identification of seasonal patterns and long term trends in snow accumulation for most of the Andes, with some sectors in central Chile and central-western Argentina showing a clear decline in snowfall and snow persistence since 2010. This recent shortage of mountain snow has caused an extended, severe drought that is unprecedented in the hydrological and climatological records from this region. Together with data from global glacier inventories, detailed inventories at local/regional scales are now also freely available, providing important new information for glaciological, hydrological, and climatological assessments in different sectors of the Andes. Numerous studies largely based on field measurements and/or remote sensing techniques have documented the recent glacier shrinkage throughout the Andes. This observed ice mass loss has put Andean glaciers among the highest contributors to sea level rise per unit area. Other recent studies have focused on rock glaciers, showing that in extensive semi-arid sectors of the Andes these mountain permafrost features contain large reserves of freshwater and may play a crucial role as future climate becomes warmer and drier in this region. Many relevant issues remain to be investigated, however, including an improved estimation of ice volumes at local scales, and detailed assessments of the hydrological significance of the different components of the cryosphere in Andean river basins. The impacts of future climate changes on the Andean cryosphere also need to be studied in more detail, considering the contrasting climatic scenarios projected for each region. The sustained work of various monitoring programs in the different Andean countries is promising and will provide much needed field observations to validate and improve the analyses made from remote sensors and modeling techniques. In this sense, the development of a well-coordinated network of high-elevation hydro-meteorological stations appears as a much needed priority to complement and improve the many glaciological and hydro-climatological assessments that are being conducted across the Andes.

Feisal; Shinn, Jamie; Arango-Quiroga, Johan; Huq, Saleemul			Climate loss-and-damage funding: how to get money to where it's needed fast	NATURE			English	Editorial Material								Last year, countries agreed to establish a fund to address climate-related 'loss and damage' at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. One year on, recommendations on the basics of the fund's structure, governance and funding are expected to be set out at COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, at the end of this month. It won't be a full picture - negotiations are continuing and it will take time for the details to be worked out. Nonetheless, we argue, it's crucial that aspects of the fund start to operate in 2024, including the release of small grants to support the most vulnerable people experiencing climate impacts. Lessons must be drawn quickly from other areas of climate finance, too, notably the Green Climate Fund (GCF) - the world's largest dedicated resource for supporting climate mitigation and adaptation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). By 1 November, the GCF had allocated US$13.5 billion to 243 projects since it was established in 2010. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing: the GCF has been widely criticized for being too slow, difficult to access and risk averse. On average, the fund takes more than two years to approve projects; one-fifth of the projects take 3-5 years. By contrast, humanitarian organizations such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement respond in hours to disasters such as the massive flood in September that hit the port city of Derna in Libya. Similarly, climate loss-and-damage funding must be quick and easy for anyone to access - not just governments, but also cities and community groups. That's not the case for the GCF: more than three-quarters of its projects are led by large international organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. The GCF took five years to get established, and a further year to release its first funds, because of the complex way it operates. So far, just 28% ($3.8 billion) of its committed funding has been disbursed. The loss-and-damage fund must not fall into those same traps. Here we outline four recommendations for how the loss-and-damage fund should operate. These are grounded in principles of climate justice1 and include lessons from the GCF - specifically, from the deliberations of 15 GCF board meetings covering 181 projects between 2016 and 2021, survey responses from 42 applicants to the fund, and other publicly available data on the fund's portfolio of projects and proposals.

Severe weather accompanied with human activities can exacerbate this issue degrading soil health and conse-quently accelerating global and regional food insecurity. Erosion impairs soil physical and chemical properties such as infiltration rate, water holding capacity, loss of nutrients including soil carbon and nitrogen. Although, temporal properties of a rainfall event have meaningful implications, spatial heterogeneity of a rainfall con-tributes substantially and cannot be overlooked. Therefore, in this study, we investigated soil loss using weather radar NEXRAD data. We developed extreme rainfall (ER) scenarios and land use practices (nomgt, S0, S1, S2, and S3) and evaluated the watershed response. We found that grazing can manifold soil loss, and if accompanied with extreme rainfalls, soil loss accelerates impacting different subbasins each time. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity of ERs can be more significant in individual extreme rainfalls, however, over a year, soil moisture and type of the management practices (grazing and farming) could contribute more to topsoil loss. We classified watershed subbasins into different classes of soil loss severity to determine the soil loss hotspots. Soil loss can go as high as 350 (ton/ha/yr) under the ERs. Land use practices can increase erosion by 3600%. Slight increase in rainfall concentration (S1) can put vulnerable subbasins in extremely severe class (>150 ton/ha/yr). Under moderate increase in the rainfall concentration (S2) more subbasins fall into extremely severe category yielding approximately 200 ton/ha/yr. Under high increase in rainfall concentration (S3) almost all the subbasins fall into the extremely severe class yielding >200 ton/ha/yr. We found that in vulnerable subbasins, up to 10% increase in (Concentration Ratio Index) CI can increase annual soil loss up to 75%. Single ER can generate up to 35% of annual soil loss. Under one ER event soil loss hotspot subbasins can lose up to 160 ton/ha/day. 32% and 80% increase in rainfall amount for an ER event can increase soil loss by 94% and 285% respectively. The results, also, reveal that grazing and farming can be responsible for up 50% of soil loss. Our findings indicate the importance of site-specific managements to mitigate soil loss and all the consequences. Our study can help in better soil loss management implementation. Insights of our study may also help in water quality control and flood mitigation planning efforts.

The purpose of this study was to identify flood-prone areas in the Al Wala Valley in the governorate of Madaba in Jordan through analysis of the Al Wala Dam. Modelling of dam breaches was conducted under two scenarios: a Clear Day scenario and a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) scenario. The former scenario does not address the various dam failure modes; rather, it addresses the formation and development of a breach as a result of structural failures like the sliding of dam blocks in the case of a concrete dam or piping failures in the case of embankment dams. The PMF scenarios, however, simulate unsteady flow in pipes and overtopping failure via consideration of runoff hydrography. In the PMF scenario, flood-prone areas can be identified by in-depth analysis of data from previous extreme rainfall events. The related hydrologic and hydraulic data can then be modelled using intensity-duration-frequency curves applied to an hour-by-hour simulation to discover the areas most at risk of flooding in the future. In the present study, data were collected from inlet of flow to Al Wala Valley on 10 January 2013. The collected data, which included rainfall and discharge data, were fed to the HEC-HMS software in order to calibrate the hydrological parameters of the watershed of the Al Wala Dam. Additionally, the HEC-RAS tool was employed to determine the breach outflow hydrography and hydraulic conditions across various critical downstream locations, which were determined by use of dynamic flood wave-routing models. The simulations revealed that, in the case of the Clear Day scenario, downstream inundation would cover an area of 5.262 km(2) in the event of a pipe failure. However, in the event of a six-hour storm, a twelve-hour storm, and a twenty-four-hour storm, the flooded area would rise to 6.837 km(2), 8.518 km(2), and 9.390 km(2), respectively. In the event of an overtopping failure, 13.171 km(2) would be inundated, according to the Clear Day scenario. On the other hand, in the event of a six-hour storm, a twelve-hour storm, and a twenty four-hour storm, the flooded area would rise to 13.302 km(2), 14.249 km(2), and 14.594 km(2), respectively.

Riparian vegetation flow response guilds are assemblages of species that have common functional traits and are hypothesised to respond similarly to fluvial disturbance and water availability along rivers. Species distribution models using guilds may be useful within and across catchments, regions, and continents where floristic composition differs. We examined the distribution of riparian vegetation guilds along gradients of depth to groundwater and inundation exceedance probability (EP) on three rivers in the Colorado River basin and modelled the response of each guild to simulated changes in river flows and alluvial groundwater depth. Groundwater guild distribution models were transferable for the tall tree and flood-tolerant shrub guilds, but groundwater depth and EP thresholds differed between reaches. Optimal groundwater levels for tall trees and flood-tolerant shrubs were shallower in Colorado due to higher floodplain groundwater levels and more gentle sub-surface groundwater gradients. Riparian vegetation guilds were better predicted by groundwater depth than EP while generalist upland guilds were excluded from areas frequently inundated. Presence of the tall tree guild (e.g., Populus fremontii) was predicted by depth to groundwater at all free-flowing reaches but was not predicted at the one reach where flows are regulated by an upstream dam. In higher elevation reaches, models predicted riparian vegetation guild occurrences with less accuracy, suggesting the influence of other factors such as competition or water contributions from surrounding hillslopes. Scenarios that imposed a groundwater decline indicated that extinctions of both tall trees and flood-tolerant shrubs (e.g., Salix exigua) could occur in some reaches, depending on future groundwater contributions from hillslopes and the river. Our study demonstrates that river reaches with different plant species composition can have similar guild compositions and the occurrences of these guilds are predicted by hydrologic conditions. Depth to groundwater had a stronger magnitude effect on guild occurrence, highlighting the importance of this less frequently quantified variable in river studies. Our results suggest that the relationship between riparian flow response guild occurrence and hydrologic conditions are transferable between river reaches with differing flow regime, elevation, and climate for some, but not all guilds. Although guilds may respond in similar ways to groundwater depth and flooding, they are not all well predicted by hydrologic condition alone. Guild distributions may be transferable between river systems, but prediction accuracy increases when models are grouped based on reach-scale hillslope groundwater contributions, elevation, and valley setting.

Reconstruction of coastal flooding processes and human response at the end of the Liangzhu Culture, East China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Liangzhu City; Alkaline-earth metals; Sea-level rise; Local water level; Salinity intrusion; Global climate warming; Early warning	TRACE-ELEMENTS; YANGTZE-RIVER; YELLOW-RIVER; SEA-LEVEL; SEDIMENTS; BARIUM; SITE; GEOCHEMISTRY; BEHAVIOR; ESTUARY	Understanding coastal flooding processes in response to centennial-scale sea-level rise is essential in preparing for the challenge of present-day global warming. Mid-Holocene sea-level rise induced widespread coastal flooding along the East China coast and precipitated the collapse of the Neolithic Liangzhu Culture, the earliest known prehistoric state in East Asia. This paper presents multi-proxy analyses of sedimentology, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), and alkaline-earth metals extracted by acetic acid (HAc) of a dated sediment core, ZK07, collected from Liangzhu City, with the aim of revealing the detailed progression of coastal flooding phases and the response of prehistoric people at the end of the associated Liangzhu Culture. A three-step succession of coastal flooding processes between ca. 4.6-4.3 cal kyr BP, brought about by relative sea-level rise, is evident in core ZK07. Initially, an increase in the local water level in response to the first phase of sea-level rise is indicated by a gradual increase in TOC at ca. 4630 cal yr BP. Subsequently, at ca. 4520 cal yr BP, a second phase of increased local water-level, consistent with further sea-level rise and salinity intrusion, is suggested by higher Sr concentrations accompanied by a sharp increase in TOC. Thirdly, at ca. 4480-4315 cal yr BP, low TOC content, high - but strongly fluctuating - Sr and Ba concentrations and coarser sediment grain size are all indicative of coastal inundation caused by both storm surges and river flooding associated with typhoon events that correspond with a concurrent phase of accelerated sea-level rise. Considering the evidence of cultural deposits preserved at Liangzhu City, it appears that the Liangzhu people were forced to respond rapidly to the inundation by abandoning the city at ca. 4480 cal yr BP. We suggest that relative sea-level rise and coastal flooding at the terminal stage of the Liangzhu Culture was the regional response to global climate warming and eustatic sea-level rise at that time. Given evidence that a contemporaneous cultural transition took place in the lower Yellow River basin, we further propose that global climate change around 4.5 cal kyr BP had a widespread impact on Neolithic cultural evolution in East China. Furthermore, the rise in local water levels and associated salinity intrusions may be considered as an early warning signal in monitoring future coastal flooding risk. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth of the urbanization rate is also increasing, and the United Nations (UN) projected that 68 % of the world's population would live in urban areas by 2050. People tend to migrate from rural to urban areas, which expose them more vulnerable to urban floods. The flood-related damages and deaths are increasing every year globally. Using the Birmingham city, Alabama (AL), USA as the study area, the objective of this research is to assess potential damage risks due to flood exposure of buildings and population in an urban area. Different social and environmental factors influence urban floods in an urban area. This paper considered elevation, slope, flow accumulation, land-use, soil types, and distance from the river as significant influential factors to urban flooding. The flood risk model hence can be developed by using an integrated GIS and cartrographic approach, in which we assessed and assigned weights to these factors and formed a GIS risk assessment model, which shows the level of flood risks in the floodplain areas of Birmingham and quantifies and maps both commercial buildings, home buildings, and populations' exposed to flooding risks. This study found that the Valley Creek area is the highest flood risk zone in Birmingham, and about 48.85 percent of Valley Creek's floodplain area will face very high flood risk. The findings further reveal that total number of 5602 people are living in high and very high flood risk zones in Birmingham that approximates 44.04 % of the total population in this floodplain area. The physical vulnerability is also assessed, and findings suggest that the Valley Creek zone has the highest percentage of residential (i.e., 56.14 %) and commercial (i.e., 75.34 %) buildings located in very high flood risk areas. Our study providing a GIS risk assessment approach to locating and mapping the areas, buildings, and populations from the most to the least at risks with a fine spatical scale for urban flood risk management. The numbers of vulnerable buildings and populations within each risk category are quantified and their distributions are mapped. Therefore, revealing population's and buildings' risks and their geographic information, this flood risk assessment can help local governments and communities prepare better to take actions against future urban flood events in Birmingham, and this integrated GIS and cartographic analysis for fine flooding assessments can be applied to other urban areas for flood mitigation and risk management.

Such lakes may drain partially or completely when the stability of their dams is disturbed or as a consequence of impacts. We present a case study from the Central Asian mountain range of Tien Shan a north-oriented tributary of the Adygine Valley, where the retreat of a polythermal glacier surrounded by permafrost has resulted in the formation of several generations of lakes. The aim of this study was to analyse the past development of different types of glacial lakes influenced by the same glacier, to project the site's future development, and to evaluate the outburst susceptibility of individual lakes with an outlook for expected future change. We addressed the problem using a combination of methods, namely bathymetric, geodetic and geophysical onsite surveys, satellite images and digital elevation model analysis, and modelling of glacier development. Based on this case of the glacial lakes being of varied age and type, we demonstrated the significance of glacier ice in lake development. Lake 3, which is in contact with the glacier terminus, has changed rapidly over the last decade, expanding both in area and depth and increasing its volume by more than 13 times (7800 to 106 000m(3)). The hydrological connections and routing of glacier meltwater have proved to be an important factor as well, since most lakes in the region are drained by subsurface channels. As the site is at the boundary between continuous and discontinuous permafrost, the subsurface water flow is strongly governed by the distribution of non-frozen zones above, within, or beneath the perennially frozen ground. In the evaluation of lake outburst susceptibility, we have highlighted the importance of field data, which can provide crucial information on lake stability. In our case, an understanding of the hydrological system at the site, and its regime, helped to categorise Lake 2 as having low outburst susceptibility, while Lake 1 and Lake 3 were labelled as lakes with medium outburst susceptibility. Further development of the site will be driven mainly by rising air temperatures and increasingly negative glacier mass balance. All three climate model scenarios predicted a significant glacier areal decrease by 2050, specifically leaving 73.2% (A1B), 62.3% (A2), and 55.6% (B1) of the extent of the glacier in 2012. The glacier retreat will be accompanied by changes in glacier runoff, with the first peak expected around 2020, and the formation of additional lakes.

This study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of isotopic compositions (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in river and lake water to explore the river-lake interactions in combination with water level and discharge in Poyang Lake watershed. The results showed that river and lake water isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) exhibited highly temporal heterogeneity across seasons but their spatial differences were not remarkable, which is closely related with water sources from local precipitation and groundwater, and lake hydrology. The homogeneous patterns of lake water delta H-2 and delta O-18 indicated that Poyang Lake is a well-mixed lake in spatial scales. By contrast, the river (10.7 parts per thousand) and lake (10.8 parts per thousand) water d-excess and lc-excess (0.6 parts per thousand) were close to precipitation d-excess and lc-excess suggesting that precipitation is the main source for the lake and river. The slope and intercept of the river water line were slightly lower than those of the local meteoric water line and lake water line, which could be attributed to a greater evaporative enrichment in river water impacted by water flow regulation in the watershed. Interactions between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River vary seasonally, as evidently shown by the variations of water discharge and isotope compositions in river and lake water. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 of the Yangtze River water become more positive in the downstream zone than those in the upstream zone, indicating that the water from Poyang Lake has a great impact on downstream river water. This result can also be demonstrated by the efflux rate from the Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River, ranging from 17.9 parts per thousand to 67.9 parts per thousand across seasons except for the outlier rate in October resulted from the backflow of water from Yangtze River to the Poyang Lake. The complex lake-river interactions between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River mainly resulted from the regulation of Three Gorges Dam and water discharge from Poyang Lake watershed. These findings of the complex lake-river interactions will help to improve understanding of the hydrological processes and transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake.

Extreme flood events at higher temperatures exacerbate the loss of soil functionality and trace gas emissions in grassland	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Climate change; Nitrous oxide; Methane; Iron oxyhydroxide; PLFA; Soil microorganisms	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; PHOSPHOLIPID FATTY-ACID; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; N2O EMISSIONS; METHANE; WATER; PROFILES; IMPACTS; CARBON; DENITRIFICATION	The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (e.g. flood, drought) are predicted to increase for the foreseeable future and it is expected that these will negatively impact upon agroecosystem functioning. Our understanding of how grassland ecosystems respond to extreme weather events occurring at different times of the year, however, is lacking. To better understand the seasonal response of grassland to flooding, we subjected an agricultural grassland to an 8-week extreme flood event at three different temperatures (5 degrees C-winter, 15 degrees C-spring/autumn and 25 degrees C-summer) and then followed its subsequent recovery for 9 weeks after floodwater removal. We focused on key indicators of ecosystem functioning including primary production, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ammonia (NH3) volatilization, and soil microbial communities. The experiment used intact soil mesocosms (1 kg) with indigenous vegetation collected from a grassland with no previous history of flooding. Flooding reduced biomass production by 18% at 5 degrees C, 50% at 15 degrees C and 95% at 25 degrees C. Flooding also significantly disrupted elemental cycling (nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon) as evidenced by an increased release of P, Fe and NH4+ into the soil and overlying floodwater and large amounts of CH4 and NH3 released to the atmosphere (mainly during the flooding). These effects were more pronounced at higher temperatures (e.g. 45-700 kg CH4-C ha(-1) and 1-5 kg NH3-N ha(-1) at 15 and 25 degrees C, respectively). In addition, after floodwater removal this NH4+ was rapidly nitrified leading to large losses of N2O (1.0-14.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) at 5-25 degrees C, respectively). Especially at higher temperatures, flooding resulted in a reduction in soil microbial biomass (more than 58% of the equivalent unflooded treatment at 25 degrees C) and changes in microbial community structure (assessed by PLFAs). Further, some of these changes persisted after flood removal including a loss of actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and fungi. Overall, we conclude that ecosystem responses to extreme weather events are critically dependent on temperature with those occurring at higher temperatures having a greater negative impact than those at the lowest temperature (5 degrees C). The large potential release of CH4 and N2O also suggests that flood events should be considered as a potential source of GHGs when comparing top down and bottom-up calculations of national inventories, and that further work is needed to better refine GHG emission estimates for these events.

Late Quaternary landscape evolution and bioclimatic change in the central Great Plains, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							PLEISTOCENE-HOLOCENE TRANSITION; C-4 PLANT PRODUCTIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; RADIOCARBON AGES; ALLUVIAL FANS; CENTRAL TEXAS; LOESS; STRATIGRAPHY; MIDHOLOCENE	A systematic study of floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans in the Republican River valley of south-central Nebraska provided a well-dated, detailed reconstruction of late Quaternary landscape evolution and resolved outstanding issues related to previously proposed Holocene terrace sequences. Stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values determined on soil organic matter from buried soils in alluvial landforms were used to reconstruct the structure of vegetation communities and provided a means to investigate the relationships between bioclimatic change and fluvial activity for the period of record. Our study serves as a model for geomorphological and geoarcheological investigations in stream valleys throughout the central Great Plains and wherever loess-derived late Quaternary alluvial fans occur, in particular. Holocene alluvial landforms in the river valley include a broad floodplain complex (T-0a, T-0b, and T-0c), a single alluvial terrace (T-1), and alluvial fans that mostly grade to the T-1 (AF-1) and T-0c (AF-0c) surfaces. Remnants of a late Pleistocene terrace (T-2), mantled by Holocene (Bignell) loess, are also preserved, and some Holocene alluvial fans (AF-2) grade to T-2 surfaces. Radiocarbon ages suggest that the T-1 fill and AF-1 fans aggraded between ca. 9000-1000 yr B.P. Hence, nearly all of the Holocene alluvium in the river valley is stored in these landforms. Sedimentation, however, was interrupted by several periods of landscape stability and soil formation. Radiocarbon ages from the upper A horizons of buried soils in the T-1 and AF-1 fills, indicating approximate burial ages, cluster at ca. 6500, 4500, 3500, and 1000 yr B.P. Also, based on the radiocarbon ages, the T-0c fill and AF-0c fans were aggrading between ca. 2000-900 yr B.P. Given that the T-0c fill and upper parts of the T-1 fill were both aggrading after ca. 2000 yr B.P., we suggest that the T-1 surface was abandoned between ca. 4500-3500 yr B.P., but subsequent aggradation of both the T-1 and T-0c fills occurred due to large-magnitude flood events during the late Holocene. The delta C-13 data indicate a shift from similar to 40 % C-4 biomass at ca. 6000 to similar to 85% at ca. 4500 yr B.P. We propose a scenario where (1) a reduction in C-3 vegetation after 6000 yr B.P. destabilized the uplands, resulting in an increase in sediment supply and aggradation of the T-1 fill and AF-1 fans, and (2) the establishment of C-4 vegetation by ca. 4500 yr B.P. stabilized the uplands, resulting in a reduction in sediment supply and subsequent incision and abandonment of the T-1 and most AF-1 surfaces. The proposed timing and nature of landscape and bioclimatic change are consistent with regional records from the central Great Plains.

In this study, floodwater samples (n = 96) were collected as promptly post-hurricane as possible and for up to approximately 30 days and selectively enriched for Campylobacter using Bolton broth enrichment and isolation on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) microaerobically at 42 degrees C. Only one sample yielded Campylobacter, which was found to be Campylobacter jejuni with the novel sequence type 2866 (ST-2866). However, the methods employed to isolate Campylobacter readily yielded Arcobacter from 73.5% of the floodwater samples. The Arcobacter isolates failed to grow on Mueller-Hinton agar at 25, 30, 37, or 42 degrees C microaerobically or aerobically but could be readily subcultured on mCCDA at 42 degrees C microaerobically. Multilocus sequence typing of 112 isolates indicated that all were Arcobacter butzleri. The majority (85.7%) of the isolates exhibited novel sequence types (STs), with 66 novel STs identified. Several STs, including certain novel ones, were detected in diverse waterbody types (channel, isolated ephemeral pools, floodplain) and from multiple watersheds, suggesting the potential for regionally dominant strains. The genotypes were clearly partitioned into two major clades, one with high representation of human and ruminant isolates and another with an abundance of swine and poultry isolates. Surveillance of environmental waters and food animal production systems in this animal agriculture-dense region is needed to assess potential regional prevalence and temporal stability of the observed A. butzleri strains as well as their potential association with specific types of food animal production. IMPORTANCE Climate change and associated extreme weather events can have massive impacts on the prevalence of microbial pathogens in floodwaters. However, limited data are available on foodborne zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter or Arcobacter in hurricane-associated floodwaters in rural regions with intensive animal production. With a high density of intensive animal production as well as pronounced vulnerability to hurricanes, eastern North Carolina presents unique opportunities in this regard. Our findings revealed widespread incidence of the emerging zoonotic pathogen Arcobacter butzleri in floodwaters from Hurricane Florence. We encountered high and largely unexplored diversity while also noting the potential for regionally abundant and persistent clones. We noted pronounced partitioning of the floodwater genotypes into two source-associated clades. The data will contribute to elucidating the poorly understood ecology of this emerging pathogen and highlight the importance of surveillance of floodwaters associated with hurricanes and other extreme weather events for Arcobacter and other zoonotic pathogens.

The capillary trapping of CO2 is a primary trapping mechanism governed by the pressure difference between the wetting and nonwetting phases in a porous rock, making the latter a key input parameter for dynamic simulation models. During the CCS operational process, however, the CO2 is prone to contamination by impurities from various sources such as surfaces (e.g., pipelines and tanks) and the subsurface (e.g., existing natural gas). Such contamination can strongly influence the overall CO2 wettability, storage capacity, and containment security. Hence, the present study uses the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) core flooding technique to investigate and compare the residual saturations of pure CO2, pure N2, and a 50:50 CO2/N2 mixture in an Indiana limestone. The longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T1 and T2) are measured to examine the displacement process of the pore network, and the trapping mechanism is evaluated at the pore scale as a determinant of the field-scale flow behavior. The NMR T1-T2 and 2D maps are used to observe the fluid configurations in the pore network, and the T1/T2 ratios are used to evaluate the microscopic wettability of the limestone grains by the pore-space fluids following each drainage/imbibition process step. The results indicate substantial residual gas trapping in the rock for the CO2-brine, N2-brine, and CO2/N2-brine systems, corresponding to gas saturations of 25%, 27%, and 26%, respectively. In the CO2-brine system, the intermolecular interplay between the CO2-enriched brine and limestone grains results in a higher T1/ T2 ratio and significantly reduces the hydrophilicity of the limestone. Furthermore, the NMR T2 distribution reveals the occurrence of preferential water displacement into the large pores (r > 1 & mu;m) and from the intermediate pores (0.03 & mu;m < r < 1 & mu;m), whereas water remains immobile in the smaller pores (r < 0.03 & mu;m). The insignificant difference in residual trapping saturation between pure CO2 and the CO2-N2 mixture indicates the potential to allow for impurities in the CO2 phase in CCS without reducing the residual trapping capacity. Thus, the present work provides comprehensive information on the impact of gas injection on residual gas trapping in subsurface geological formations at the pore scale, thereby aiding in the development of CCS and other potential applications in enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

J	Arai, M; Wagai, R				Arai, Miwa; Wagai, Rota			Does rice paddy management increase soil organic carbon in the warm temperate and tropical regions?	GEODERMA REGIONAL			English	Article						Soil organic matter; Carbon sequestration; Paddy field; Warm temperate region; Tropical region	MATTER DECOMPOSITION; CHEMICAL FERTILIZER; CROPPING SYSTEMS; CHINA; SEQUESTRATION; AMENDMENTS; STORAGE; WORLD; SUSTAINABILITY; STOICHIOMETRY	Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in agricultural fields is an effective option for climate change mitigation and food security. In temperate regions, rice farming under paddy is known to increase SOC stock due mainly to the reduced decomposition caused by prolonged submerged conditions compared to the cropping practices under non-flooded conditions. It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent rice paddy management increases SOC storage in warmer climate regions where decomposition is much faster. We thus examined the factors controlling the SOC stock and the net change in SOC normalized to the duration under paddy (Delta SOC) at paddy fields in warm temperate (21 sites) and tropical climatic regions (11 sites) from peer-reviewed literature which was concentrated to Asia. Using collected data (e.g., SOC content, bulk density, mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation, management duration, soil management, crop rotation), we evaluated predictor variables that account for Delta SOC variability (i.e., mean decrease accuracy) by random forest regression. The mean paddy duration for all data (n = 170) was 22 years. Average SOC stock and Delta SOC at 0-20 cm depth were 38 +/- 1.45SE Mg C ha(-1) and 0.34 +/- 0.04SE Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, indicating that continuous paddy management had a positive effect on SOC storage in both climatic regions. SOC stock was two-fold higher and Delta SOC was four-fold higher in the warm temperate region compared to the tropical region (p < 0.05). The best predictor variables for Delta SOC were MAT followed by soil management and then paddy duration. While organic amendment including both straw and manure increased Delta SOC in both warm temperate and tropical paddies, we did not detect a positive effect of chemical fertilizer application alone or crop rotation type (e.g., rice-upland vs rice-rice). Despite high variability, Delta SOC in the warm temperate region significantly declined over time from 0.82 +/- 0.10 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (< 20 yrs) to 0.22 +/- 0.06 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). While SOC stock was 50% lower, the tropical paddies showed no clear decline in Delta SOC up to 41 years (0.04-0.21 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results suggest that SOC accretion might have reached equilibrium after 20 years of paddy practice in the warm temperate region and, if so, Delta SOC is likely to diminish to zero in the near future. In tropical paddy fields, on the other hand, slow SOC build-up may continue for a longer term although the Delta SOC value itself is not high. While the current study showed the efficacy of paddy management on SOC build-up under the warmer climate regions, further study on the rate and qualitative changes is necessary to evaluate the trade-offs between soil fertility improvement (e.g., soil N build-up) and methane emission.

Discovering the implicit relationships among severely dry/wet conditions is of great significance for meteorological disaster early warning and risk management strategy formulation. In this study, we propose an improved spatial-temporal association rule mining algorithm to mine the global dry/wet associations. A modified time-lagged association rule mining algorithm is first developed to mine unit-to-unit dry/wet association rules. Then, a density-based clustering algorithm is employed to identify associated dry/wet zones. The gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data sets at 12- and 3-month time scales were used to characterize annual and seasonal dry/wet conditions. Analysis results show that there are strong dry/wet associations between many regions. Some of the discovered association rules reflect similar associations with known phenomena, indicating the effectiveness and feasibility of the method. Other rules were previously unknown and can provide new knowledge for this research field. Several predictions can be made according to the discovered rules that western Oman and southeastern Saudi Arabia would suffer severe or extreme drought in 2021 and northwestern China would suffer severe or extreme drought in 2025 with probabilities exceeding 77%; northwestern China, northern Argentina, and western Australia would experience severe or extreme wetness in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, with probabilities exceeding 85%. The algorithm provides a new perspective for analyzing dry/wet associations and the discovered associations can be used as theoretical bases for local governments to take precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of severe drought or wetness. Plain Language Summary Severe dry or wet conditions would have serious impacts on human society and ecological environment. Discovering the implicit relationships among severely dry/ wet conditions is of great significance for meteorological disaster early warning and social and ecological losses reducing. In this study, an improved spatial-temporal association rule mining algorithm was proposed to mine the global dry/wet associations, finding associations like "With a certain degree of confidence, if area A experiences severe wetness, area B would suffer severe drought after a period of time" with no need to presuppose that areas A and B might be associated. A modified time-lagged association rule mining algorithm is first developed to mine unit-to-unit dry/wet association rules. Then, a density-based clustering algorithm is employed to identify associated dry/wet zones. Analysis results show strong annual and seasonal dry/wet associations between many regions. Some of the discovered association rules reflect similar associations with known phenomena. Other rules were previously unknown and can provide new knowledge for this research field. The dry/wet conditions of five associated regions were predicted, with probabilities exceeding 77%, which can be useful for instructing local governments to take precautions to mitigate the potential impacts of severe drought or wetness.

ALLUVIAL TERRACING IN A FALLING-STAGE BRAIDPLAIN: THE LOWER CRETACEOUS CADOMIN FORMATION, WEST-CENTRAL ALBERTA, CANADA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; FORELAND-BASIN; BASAL QUARTZ; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; EVOLUTION; UPLIFT; BAR; CYCLICITY; DEPOSITS	The Lower Cretaceous Cadomin Formation in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a thin, regionally extensive, conglomeratic fluvial deposit that accumulated over many million years on the sub-Cretaceous unconformity. Based on a dataset of approximately 50 cores and 750 wireline well logs from west-central Alberta, detailed isopach mapping of the overlying deposits reveals the presence of a complex, terraced paleo-topography on the top of the Cadomin Formation, consisting of six terrace levels in the study area. These terraces flank a series of north-south valleys that feed into a larger east-west valley to the north of the study area. This larger valley is also bordered by terraces that step downward to the north. The gradients of the north-south valley thalwegs are steeper than the flanking terraces, indicating that each terrace is diachronous and was most likely formed by the headward migration of knickpoints generated by episodic incision of the trunk valley. This palco-topography formed during a prolonged period of falling base level caused by unroofing of the adjacent orogen. Thus, the Cadomin Formation represents a falling-stage systems tract. The deposits underlying each terrace consist mainly of channel-thalweg and braid-bar deposits. Preservation of full channel-bar successions in many terraces is consistent with terrace abandonment as incision resumed following a period of mild aggradation. Terrace abandonment is also indicated by the presence of a capping layer of wind-blown silt. Pedogenic alteration of this loessite is greatest on the highest terraces and extends to considerable depths, indicating the existence of a significant hiatus at the top of the Cadomin Formation. This surface, which lies above falling-stage deposits, should be used as the sequence boundary, if the sequence boundary is thought to coincide with the time of lowest base level. This surface, although its formation was diachronous, represents a real landscape surface, unlike the composite erosion surface beneath the Cadomin Formation (i.e., the sub-Cretaceous unconformity). The alternation of incision and aggradation that generated the terraces was probably the result of allogenic fluctuations in sediment supply caused by climate cycles, as was the case for analogous Quaternary terrace staircases. Downstepping alluvial terraces are a viable mechanism for the progradation of alluvial gravels long distances from a mountain belt during periods of basin uplift, and may explain the relatively thin, but areally extensive, alluvial sandstone and conglomerate sheets that are common at major unconformities in the stratigraphic record. We suggest that signs of subtle terracing may have been overlooked in similar sheet-like alluvial deposits elsewhere, although they can be removed by erosion during shoreline transgression or by later fluvial-channel migration. In the case of the Cadomin Formation, the exceptional preservation of the terraces is likely due to a combination of the difficulty of eroding the conglomerate and indurated loessite cap, and of the low-energy nature of floodplain sedimentation in the overlying Gething Formation.

In large fluvial systems, oxidation of OCpetro during transit releases a large flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, influencing climate changes; however, the transport and fate of OCpetro and their controls along the fluvial-marine transition remain poorly constrained. Here, we combined Raman spectral, radiocarbon activity ((FC)-C-14), mineralogical, and sedimentological techniques with multiple geochemical analyses to characterize the dynamics of OCpetro in the water column and sediment particles from the Yangtze River channel-estuary-shelf continuum systems. Our data show that much of the OCpetro present in suspended sediment (POCpetro) exported by the Yangtze River is ''labile" fractions (mostly disordered materials) that can be degraded or lost during transport across the estuarine continuum, whereas the OCpetro deposited in seabed sediment are characterized by highly recalcitrant, unreactive, and graphitic carbon phases. As discrete ''free" particles, coarse plant debris (>63 mu m) with ages of several thousand years observed in the proximal delta of the Yangtze River exhibit nearly identical characteristics of disordered materials, and the presence of aged vascular plant detritus (carbon-rich and C-14-depleted materials) may lead to an overestimate of OCpetro in marine sediments. Using a Bayesian endmember mixing approach, a binary mixing model, and the ratio of fraction modern carbon ((FC)-C-14) to Al/OC, we found a large decrease in POCpetro concentration and loading from the suspended sediments to seabed sediments, suggesting a loss of mineral-bound OCpetro fraction during sediment transport through the estuary and deposition on the shelf. We estimated that, on average, 46 +/- 35 % of the POCpetro initially present in suspended sediments delivered to the Yangtze River Estuary during a flood event was primarily oxidized at the sediment-water interface, leaving the most graphitic carbon components transported laterally and efficiently reburied in shelf sediments. We found that during estuarine mixing, flocculation process-induced microaggregates may provide transient physical protection for POCpetro in the form of inclusions/aggregates with carbonate minerals; however, when POCpetro is physically and chemically separated from its mineral matrix via disaggregation and dissolution, it may be easily oxidized by microbial activity. In contrast, OC-phyllosilicates interactions exert a first-order control on the preservation of OCpetro in marine sediments. Our findings suggest that the importance of POCpetro oxidation and loss in carbon cycling and budget assessments of estuaries may be underestimated. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, 26 sub-basins over 10 km2 are taken into account and flood dynamics of subbasins are evaluated depending on morphometric properties. The results obtained according to the morphometric parameters are evaluated based on statistical techniques, and the flood priority is determined. A total of 20 different indices were used in this study. The obtained morphometry results were evaluated according to the probability of occurrence of floods according to three different methods including morphometric priority, flood priority according to principal component analysis method and Redvan's priority ranking method. Each method is evaluated within itself and flood priorities of sub-basins have been determined. With respect to the 26 subbasins of the Hars, it River and according to the morphometric priority method and results obtained from this method, 8 sub-basins have low flood priority, 12 basins have medium flood priority, and 7 basins have high flood priority. By examining the results obtained from the PCA priority method, 11 sub-basins have low flood priority, 6 sub-basins have medium flood priority, while 9 basins have high flood priority. Finally, according to the Redvan's priority method and its classification, 11 sub-basins are located in the low priority class, 6 sub-basins have medium flood priority. According to this method, the number of sub-basins with high priority is 9. Priorities obtained using three different techniques were checked for accuracy with 6 different statistical parameters based on predicted and inventory datasets. Accordingly, the accuracy value for the RPRM and PCA methods are higher than the MA method. On the other hand, the RPRM method has the highest TN value, which is equal to 7 subbasins, which shows the correct prediction of sub-basins with the low flood risk. Based on the results, it was seen that the obtained values have a high consistency in basin morphometry. The RPRM, which is a new suggested technique in determining basin flood priority, shows that common basins give very similar results with the results obtained according to morphometry and PCA method. Sub-basins with common flood risk, due to outputs of used methods, were compared with recorded floods map of Turkey.

The devastating flood in the arid region a consequence of rainfall and dam failure: Case study, Al-Lith flood on 23th November 2018, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE			English	Article						devastating floods; dam failure; inundation; Al-Lith; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia	FLASH-FLOOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; RISK; GIS; BASIN; TIME; SIMULATION; TORRENT; LOSSES	On November 23, 2018, cascading rainfall events that occurred in the upstream section of wadi Al-Lith, which is located in the western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, caused a failure in the Al-Lith earthen dam. This event was followed by a large-scale devastating flood that inundated the area downstream of the dam, damaging infrastructure and property. The main scope of this work was to identify the causes of catastrophic flooding and ways to prevent and mitigate the potential consequences of a future flood occurrence in the study area. For this purpose, remote sensing images, DEM, field observations, and rainfall data were used. A geospatial integrated approach using a GIS, remote sensing, hydromorphological analysis, and rainfall-runoff modeling was utilized to provide a better understanding of the hydrology of the wadi Al-Lith catchment. Various methods were used for rainfall frequency analyses; supervised classification was applied on Landsat (OLI), in which land-use types were classified to identify the curve number values. Rainfall-runoff modeling was conducted using the catchment characteristics and rainfall analysis to calculate flood volumes and peak discharges. Peak discharge results at the flood event on November 23, 2018, and at 5- and 100-year return periods were used for the prediction of flood extent using the 2D HEC-RAS model. Water inundated depth and velocity were mapped. The result of the 5-year return period simulated model showed a good correlation with the flood extent of the event on November 23, 2018 that extracted from the sentinel-2 image. This model was validated using field observation data and remote sensing interpretation at the real flood event of November 2018. The flood model indicated that a dam failure with the substantial release of an enormous amount of water in a short period created exacerbates the problem. Also, the simulated model of the 100-year return period showed high-risk of the whole floodplain area of Wadi Al-Lith and the urbanized zone, where utterly devastation could be occurred. Finally, the results showed that a new dam proposal is urgently required to prevent the area from future flood events to replace the failed dam with a 45 m high dam. In this case, the reservoir capacity is estimated to be similar to 147.4 million m(3), which is above the runoff volume for a 200-year return period.

Here we present a cutting-edge case study applying catchment-modelling techniques with evaluation against river flow at the global scale for the first time. The modelling procedure was challenging but doable, and even the first model version showed better performance than traditional gridded global models of river flow. We used the open-source code of the HYPE model and applied it for >130 000 catchments (with an average resolution of 1000 km(2)), delineated to cover the Earth's landmass (except Antarctica). The catchments were characterized using 20 open databases on physiographical variables, to account for spatial and temporal variability of the global freshwater resources, based on exchange with the atmosphere (e.g. precipitation and evapotranspiration) and related budgets in all compartments of the land (e.g. soil, rivers, lakes, glaciers, and floodplains), including water stocks, residence times, and the pathways between various compartments. Global parameter values were estimated using a stepwise approach for groups of parameters regulating specific processes and catchment characteristics in representative gauged catchments. Daily and monthly time series (> 10 years) from 5338 gauges of river flow across the globe were used for model evaluation (half for calibration and half for independent validation), resulting in a median monthly KGE of 0.4. However, the World-Wide HYPE (WWH) model shows large variation in model performance, both between geographical domains and between various flow signatures. The model performs best (KGE > 0.6) in the eastern USA, Europe, South-East Asia, and Japan, as well as in parts of Russia, Canada, and South America. The model shows overall good potential to capture flow signatures of monthly high flows, spatial variability of high flows, duration of low flows, and constancy of daily flow. Nevertheless, there remains large potential for model improvements, and we suggest both redoing the parameter estimation and reconsidering parts of the model structure for the next WWH version. This first model version clearly indicates challenges in large-scale modelling, usefulness of open data, and current gaps in process understanding. However, we also found that catchment modelling techniques can contribute to advance global hydrological predictions. Setting up a global catchment model has to be a long-term commitment as it demands many iterations; this paper shows a first version, which will be subjected to continuous model refinements in the future. WWH is currently shared with regional/local modellers to appreciate local knowledge.	[Arheimer, Berit; Pimentel, Rafael; Isberg, Kristina; Crochemore, Louise; Andersson, Jafet C.

These gradients modulate the spatial structure of glacier retreat and are correlated with other physical and biochemical variability along the shelf, but their structure and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, the magnitude, spatial structure, seasonal-to-interannual variability, and driving mechanisms of along-shore exchange are investigated using the output of a high-resolution numerical model and with hydrographic data collected in Palmer Deep. The analyses reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle of along-shore transport, with a net flux (7.0 x 10(5) m(3)/s) of cold water toward the central WAP (cWAP) in winter, which reverses in summer with a net flow (5.2 x 10(5) m(3)/s) of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and modified CDW (mCDW) toward Bransfield Strait. Significant interannual variability is found as the pathway of a coastal current transporting Weddell-sourced water along the WAP shelf is modulated by wind forcing. When the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) is positive during winter, stronger upwelling-favorable winds dominate in Bransfield Strait, leading to offshore advection of the Weddell-sourced water. Negative SAM leads to weaker upwelling- or downwelling-favorable winds and enhanced flooding of the cWAP with cold water from Bransfield Strait. This process can result in significant (0.5 degrees C below 200 m) cooling of the continental shelf around Palmer Station, highlighting that along-shore exchange is critical in modulating the hydrographic properties along the WAP. Plain Language Summary The melting of glaciers and the structure of ecosystems along the West Antarctic Peninsula have been influenced by the local temperature and salinity patterns. Our understanding of what controls the spatial structure and temporal variability of these gradients is limited. In this study, we analyze output from a state-of-the-art numerical model and find that there is strongly seasonal and interannual variability in the along-shore exchange processes that control those gradients. The interannual variability of the along-shore exchange is related to the local winds. As the wind conditions vary in response to hemispheric-scale climate processes, the amount of cold water flowing into the central West Antarctic Peninsula from Bransfield Strait varies interannually. We show this is a key process in the evolution of ocean properties in the West Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf.

Here, state-of-the-art methods on hydraulic and statistical modelling are applied to historical and contemporaneous flood records to evaluate flood hazards beyond natural climate cycles. A comprehensive flood record of the Duero River in Zamora (Spain) was compiled from documentary sources, early water-level readings and continuous gauge records spanning the last 500 years. Documentary evidence of flood events includes minute books (municipal and ecclesiastic), narrative descriptions, epigraphic marks, newspapers and technical reports. We identified 69 flood events over the period 1250 to 1871, of which 15 were classified as catastrophic floods, 16 as extraordinary floods and 38 as ordinary floods. Subsequently, a two-dimensional hydraulic model was implemented to relate flood stages (flood marks and inundated areas) to discharges. The historical flood records show the largest floods over the last 500 years occurred in 1860 (3450m(3) s(-1)), 1597 (3200m(3) s (-1)) and 1739 (2700m(3) s (-1)). Moreover, at least 24 floods exceeded the perception threshold of 1900m(3) s (-1) during the period (1500-1871). Annual maximum flood records were completed with gauged water-level readings (pre-instrumental dataset, PRE: 1872-1919) and systematic gauge records (systematic dataset, SYS: 1920-2018). The flood frequency analyses were based on (1) the expected moments algorithm (EMA) and (2) the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) method, using five datasets with different temporal frameworks (historic dataset, HISTO: 1511-2018; PRE-SYS: 1872-2018; full systematic record, ALLSYS: 1920-2018; SYS1: 1920-1969; and SYS2: 1970-2018). The most consistent results were obtained using the HISTO dataset, even for high quantiles (0.001% annual exceedance probability, AEP). PRE-SYS was robust for the 1% AEP flood with increasing uncertainty in the 0.2% AEP or 500-year flood, and ALLSYS results were uncertain in the 1% and 0.2% AEP floods. Since the 1970s, the frequency of extraordinary floods (>1900m(3) s(-1)) declined, although floods on the range of the historical perception threshold occurred in 2001 (2075m(3) s(-1)) and 2013 (1654m(3) s (-1)). Even if the future remains uncertain, this bottom-up approach addresses flood hazards under climate variability, providing real and certain flood discharges. Our results can provide a guide on low-regret adaptation decisions and improve public perception of extreme flooding.

The strong El Nino and weak La Nina events in the Pacific significantly impacted the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) and were followed by extreme negative and weak positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phases in 2016 and 2017, which triggered floods in the Indian subcontinent and drought conditions in East Africa. The IOD is an irregular and periodic oscillation in the Indian Ocean, which has attracted much attention in the last two decades due to its impact on the climate in surrounding landmasses. Much work has been done in the past to investigate global climate change and its impact on the evolution of IOD. The dynamic behind it, however, is still not well understood. The present study, using various satellite datasets, examined and analyzed the dynamics behind these events and their impacts on SST variability in the TIO. For this study, the monthly mean SST data was provided by NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST). SST anomalies were measured on the basis of 30-year mean daily climatology (1981-2010). It was determined that the eastern and western poles of the TIO play quite different roles during the sequence of negative and positive IOD phases. The analysis of air-sea interactions and the relationship between wind and SST suggested that SST is primarily controlled by wind force in the West pole. On the other hand, the high SST that occurred during the negative IOD phase induced local convection and westerly wind anomalies via the Bjerknes feedback mechanism. The strong convection, which was confined to the (warm) eastern equatorial Indian Ocean was accompanied by east-west SST anomalies that drove a series of downwelling Kelvin waves that deepened the thermocline in the east. Another notable feature of this study was its observation of weak upwelling along the Omani-Arabian coast, which warmed the SST by 1 degrees C in the summer of 2017 (as compared to 2016). This warming led to increased precipitation in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region during the summer of 2017. The results of the present work will be important for the study of monsoons and may be useful in predicting both droughts and floods in landmasses in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean, especially in the Indian subcontinent and East African regions.

J	Ries, F; Kirn, L; Weiler, M				Ries, Fabian; Kirn, Lara; Weiler, Markus			Experimental investigation of runoff generation following extreme precipitation	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG			German	Article						Pluvial floods; torrential rainfall; runoff generation; experimental hydrology	SCALE	Rainfall of exceptionally high intensities and resulting in pluvial floods is a destructive natural hazard, as was demonstrated by the pluvial floods in Braunsbach, Simbach in 2016 and Wuppertal in 2018. These incidents also show that the prediction or even estimation of runoff responses from such localized extreme events and associated hazards is possible only to a very limited extent. Although time series of observed rainfall still do not show a clear trend concerning the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events of short duration, it must be assumed that such events are occurring with increasing frequency and higher potential for damage due to climate change and growing settlement pressure. Torrential rainfall affecting small spatial scales cause hydrological phenomena that cannot be simply compared with the flood generating mechanisms on the spatial scale of larger catchments. For example, runoff rates are higher, response times are shorter and Horton overland flow is often the dominant form of runoff generation. At the same time, only a few detailed observations on runoff generation during torrential rainfall events exist. Within the presented study, over 130 rainfall events at 23 locations on grassland and arable land and a large variety of relevant soil types in the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg were realized using a large mobile rainfall simulator. Location specific 100-year rainfall events with a duration of 15 minutes and up to 1 hour as well as a constant maximum observed amount in Baden-Wurttemberg for 1 h and 3 h-rainfall events, were simulated on an area of 100 square meters. The principal aim of the study was to investigate runoff rates, temporal runoff dynamics and the identification of dominant runoff processes in dependency on location parameter. Besides the distribution of simulated rainfall, surface runoff and subsurface runoff, soil moisture and the development of temporally saturated areas were monitored with high temporal resolution. The effect of variable soil moisture on runoff generation could be studied by repeating the simulation of an event with a return period of 100 years and a duration of one hour. Under dry preconditions less than half of the experimental sites produced a relevant runoff response despite high intensities between 40 and 70 mm/h. The results of the experiments also demonstrate the large variability of runoff reactions concerning temporal dynamics, peak runoff rates and runoff coefficients which could be attributed to certain properties at some locations. The experimental data set is freely available and could contribute to a validation and improvement of process oriented hydrological models and getting closer to the goal of a comprehensive pluvial flood risk assessment and realistic flood hazard maps with a complete spatial coverage.

However, their development and distribution patterns in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings still need to be elucidated. In this study, a published glacier ice thickness distribution dataset was employed to fully detect overdeepened glacier beds as potential glacial lakes. We selected and expanded four morphological metrics to determine the formation probability of potential glacial lakes: surface slope, break in slope, lake area, and position on the glacier. The results revealed that 15,826 potential glacial lakes with areas > 0.02 km(2) exist in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings, covering an area of 2253.95 +/- 1291.29 km(2) with a water volume of 60.49 +/- 28.94 km(3) that would contribute to an equivalent sea level rise of 0.16 +/- 0.08 mm. The experimental comparison and uncertainty assessment for the overdeepening processing showed that the different extraction methods and basic digital elevation models used could lead to non-negligible errors in the results (at least +/- 30%), which were ignored in previous studies, contributing to major divergences between the several current inventories of potential glacial lakes in the plateau. Notably, approximately 90% of the total area of the potential glacial lakes is concentrated in the lower half of the individual glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings. > 70% of the potential glacial lakes and contemporary glacial lakes in this region were found to be concentrated within the 4000-5800 m elevation range. Moreover, the study identified 5361 potential glacial lakes with high or very high exposure probabilities, and their distribution was mostly determined by regional glacier resources. However, the numbers and sizes of some potential glacial lakes that are found in the Karakoram region are considered to be exaggerated because of the presence of numerous surge-type glaciers, which have not been discussed in previous studies. These results can improve our understanding of future glacial lake formation and distribution in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings and have implications for further implementation of effective prevention, mitigation, and adaptation measures for glacial lake outburst floods and water security.

Due to the high rate of discharge of the GBM caused by the summer monsoon and the snowmelt of the Eastern Himalaya and Southern Tibetan Plateau due to climate change, Bangladesh witnessed 16 flood events over 1954-2017. We performed a multiproxy treering analysis to investigate the impact of extreme flood events on tree growth, xylem anatomical parameters and oxygen isotope composition of tree-ring cellulose (delta O-18(tr)) in a Bangladeshi moist tropical forest and to establish relationships between water level of the regional rivers and tree-ring parameters. By using pointer year analysis and comparing the pointer years with historical flood records (a cut-off threshold of the country's flooded land area of 33.3%), we identified the three extreme flood events (hereafter called flood years) 1974, 1988, and 1998 in Bangladesh. Superposed epoch analysis revealed significant changes in Tree-ring width (TRW), total vessel area (TVA), vessel density (VD), and delta O-18(tr) during flood years. Flood associated hypoxic soil conditions reduced TRWup to 53% and TVA up to 28%, varying with flood events. In contrast, VD increased by 23% as a safety mechanis magainst flood induced hydraulic failure. Tree-ring delta O-18 significantly decreased during the flood years due to the amount effect in regional precipitation. Bootstrapped Pearson correlation analysis showed that wood anatomical variables encoded stronger river level signals than TRW and delta(18)Otr. Among the wood anatomical parameters, VD showed a strong relationship (r=-0.58, p < 0.01) with the water level of theManu River, a regional river of the north-eastern part of Bangladesh, indicating that VD can be used as a reliable proxy for river level reconstruction. Our analyses suggest that multiproxy tree-ring analysis is a potential tool to study tropical moist forest responses to extreme flood events and to identify suitable proxies for reconstructing hydrological characteristics of South Asian rivers.

Additional runoff leads to more frequent and more intense floods. In urban areas, these flood events are often catastrophic due to infrastructure built along the riverbank and within the floodplains. Sufficient data allow for flood modeling used to implement proper warning signals and evacuation plans, however, in least developed countries (LDC), the lack of field data for precipitation and river flows makes hydrologic and hydraulic modeling difficult. Within the most recent data revolution, the availability of remotely sensed data for land use/land cover (LULC), flood mapping, and precipitation estimates has increased, however, flood mapping in urban areas of LDC is still limited due to low resolution of remotely sensed data (LULC, soil properties, and terrain), cloud cover, and the lack of field data for model calibration. This study utilizes remotely sensed precipitation, LULC, soil properties, and digital elevation model data to estimate peak discharge and map simulated flood extents of urban rivers in ungauged watersheds for current and future LULC scenarios. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis was proposed to predict a future LULC. Additionally, return period precipitation events were calculated using the theoretical extreme value distribution approach with two remotely sensed precipitation datasets. Three calculation methods for peak discharge (curve number and lag method, curve number and graphical TR-55 method, and the rational equation) were performed and compared to a separate Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) analysis to determine the method that best represents urban rivers. HEC-RAS was then used to map the simulated flood extents from the peak discharges and ArcGIS helped to determine infrastructure and population affected by the floods. Finally, the simulated flood extents from HEC-RAS were compared to historic flood event points, images of flood events, and global surface water maximum water extent data. This analysis indicates that where field data are absent, remotely sensed monthly precipitation data from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) where GPM is the Global Precipitation Mission can be used with the curve number and lag method to approximate peak discharges and input into HEC-RAS to represent the simulated flood extents experienced. This work contains a case study for seven urban rivers in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Impact of River Channel Lateral Migration on Microbial Communities across a Discontinuous Permafrost Floodplain	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						permafrost; active layer; methanogenesis; methanotrophy; Koyukuk; Alaska	COENZYME M REDUCTASE; ORGANIC-CARBON; METHANE PRODUCTION; LENA DELTA; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; EROSION; MINERALIZATION; AMPLIFICATION; ABUNDANCE	Permafrost soils store approximately twice the amount of carbon currently present in Earth's atmosphere and are acutely impacted by climate change due to the polar amplification of increasing global temperature. Many organic-rich permafrost sediments are located on large river floodplains, where river channel migration periodically erodes and redeposits the upper tens of meters of sediment. Channel migration exerts a first-order control on the geographic distribution of permafrost and floodplain stratigraphy and thus may affect microbial habitats. To examine how river channel migration in discontinuous permafrost environments affects microbial community composition, we used amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on sediment samples from floodplain cores and exposed riverbanks along the Koyukuk River, a large tributary of the Yukon River in west-central Alaska. Microbial communities are sensitive to permafrost thaw: communities found in deep samples thawed by the river closely resembled near-surface active-layer communities in nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses but did not resemble floodplain permafrost communities at the same depth. Microbial communities also displayed lower diversity and evenness in permafrost than in both the active layer and permafrost-free point bars recently deposited by river channel migration. Taxonomic assignments based on 16S and quantitative PCR for the methyl coenzyme M reductase functional gene demonstrated that methanogens and methanotrophs are abundant in older permafrost-bearing deposits but not in younger, nonpermafrost point bar deposits. The results suggested that river migration, which regulates the distribution of permafrost, also modulates the distribution of microbes potentially capable of producing and consuming methane on the Koyukuk River floodplain. IMPORTANCE Arctic lowlands contain large quantities of soil organic carbon that is currently sequestered in permafrost. With rising temperatures, permafrost thaw may allow this carbon to be consumed by microbial communities and released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane. We used gene sequencing to determine the microbial communities present in the floodplain of a river running through discontinuous permafrost. We found that the river's lateral movement across its floodplain influences the occurrence of certain microbial communities-in particular, methane-cycling microbes were present on the older, permafrost-bearing eroding riverbank but absent on the newly deposited river bars. Riverbank sediment had microbial communities more similar to those of the floodplain active-layer samples than permafrost samples from the same depth.

The development of the SSS is described by means of a quadripartite model. (1) The geological framework of the SSS: Forming the lithological and structural features in the bedrock as a result of different temperature, pressure and dynamic-metamorphic processes. (2) Prestage of SSS: Forming the paleo-landscape with a stable fluvial regime as a starting point for the SSS. (3) Proto-SSS: Transition into the metastable fluvial regime of the SSS. (4) Modern SSS: Operation of the metastable fluvial regime Tectonics plays a dual role. Late Paleozoic fold tectonic creates the basis for the studied SSS and has a guiding effect on the development of morphotectonic units during the Neogene and Quaternary. Late Cenozoic fault tectonics triggered the SSS to incise into the Paleozoic basement. The change in the bedrock lithology has an impact on the fluvial and colluvial sediments as well as their landforms. The latter reflects a conspicuous modification: straight drainage system double right arrow higher sinuosity and paired terraces double right arrow hillwash plains. Climate change has an indirect effect controlling via the bedrock the intensity of mechanical and chemical weathering. The impact on the development of the SSS can be assessed as follows: Tectonics >> climate approximately equal to bedrock lithology. The three parameters cause a facies zonation: (1) wide-and-shallow valley (Miocene), (2) wide-angle V-shaped valley (Plio-Pleistocene), (3) acute-angle V-shaped valley (Pleistocene), (4) V-shaped to U-shaped valleys (Pleistocene-Holocene). Numerical data relevant for the hydrographic studies of the SSS are determined in each reference area: (1) Quantification of fluvial and colluvial deposits along the drainage system, (2) slope angles, (3) degree of sinuosity as a function of river facies, (4) grain size distribution, (5) grain morphological categorization, (6) grain orientation ("situmetry"), (7) channel density, (8) channel/floodplain ratios. Thermodynamic computations (Eh, pH, concentration of solubles) are made to constrain the paleoclimatic regime during formation of the SSS. The current model of the SSS is restricted in its application to the basement of the Variscan-Type orogens, to an intermediate crustal maturity state.

Due to the complexity of groundwater flow systems and the difficulty in obtaining direct observational data related to groundwater resources, it remains challenging to characterize groundwater drought quantitatively. To this end, standardized groundwater level index (SGI), which was modified from the standardized precipitation index (SPI), was used to quantify groundwater drought with the long-term groundwater level data (1981-2010) obtained from the Climate Response Network wells across the conterminous United States. The best fitting function of groundwater level distributions was lognormal which was selected from various distribution functions based on the Anderson-Darling (AD) test among 100 wells. Four monitoring wells located in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were selected as the main research objects. The trend of change in groundwater level was divided into two categories: the wells in Georgia and Oklahoma showed an initial decrease followed by an increase while the wells in Massachusetts and Washington showed a continuous decline. Groundwater drought varied significantly in different areas due to the complexity of geographical location, agricultural irrigation, population and other natural environment and human activities. Start and end time of drought conditions and the severity of drought and flooding at different time scales in the same area also varied, therefore it is necessary to describe different groundwater droughts at a reasonable time scale. In this paper, the difference between SGI and SPI at different time scales was so obvious that the cross-correlation analysis was used to find the law of lag time. The cross-correlation coefficients increased with the increasing time scales, and the average correlation values between SPI and SGI of wells in Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington were -0.568, -0.634, -0.667 and 0.496, respectively. With the time scale increased, the lag time in Georgia and Oklahoma also increased, but the lag time in Massachusetts and Washington region was almost unchanged, and there was almost no lag time in Massachusetts region. Through the study of the hydrogeological conditions such as vadose zone, lithology, soil and the influence of human activities, the hysteresis effect can be analysed, which can provide a new alternative to the conventional method and important information for future groundwater resource management.

J	Qazi, N				Qazi, Nuzhat			Hydrological functioning of forested catchments, Central Himalayan Region, India	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Forested catchments; Stormflow; Baseflow; Soil moisture; Sediment transport; Water budget	SOIL-MOISTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; RUNOFF RESPONSE; RAINFALL; IMPACTS; EROSION; SENSITIVITY; WATERSHEDS; COMPONENTS	Background: Central Himalayan forested catchments provide fresh water supply and innumerable ecosystem services to millions of people. Hence, the understanding of linkages between forests and water is very crucial for availability and quality of water at catchment scale. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the hydrological response of two forested catchments (namely, Arnigad and Bansigad) in the Central Himalayan Region. Methods: Three-years' data (March, 2008 to February, 2011) were collected from meteorological and hydrological stations in Arnigad and Bansigad catchments. The present paper describes the mean hydrological response of these forested catchments investigated through detailed field investigation. Results: The annual hyetograph analysis revealed that the rainfall at both the catchments was highly seasonal, and wet-period (June-September) plays a key role in catchment functioning. Exceedance of rainfall threshold of similar to 200 mm (similar to 10% of annual rainfall) significantly increased streamflow generation in both catchments. In Arnigad, the stream was perennial with a mean baseflow of similar to 83 mm per month (similar to 6% of annual baseflow) whereas, Bansigad had greater seasonality due to lack of streamflow during the pre-wet-period (March-May). Separation of hydrographs in Arnigad and Bansigad catchments i.e. stormflow (6% and 31%, respectively) and baseflow (50% and 32%, respectively) helped to understand the probability of flooding during wet-period and drought during dry-period. The forest ecosystem in Arnigad displayed healthier hydrological functioning in terms of reduced stormflow (82%), and enhanced baseflow (52%), soil moisture (13%), steady infiltration rate (22%) and lag time (similar to 15 min) relative to Bansigad. These enhanced values indicated soil capability to store water in the forested catchment (Arnigad) and helped to understand the volume of water (discharge) that was available during dry-period. The lower denudation rate at Arnigad by 41% resulted in decreased suspended sediment (18%) and bed load (75%) compared to Bansigad. Further, the enhanced dissolved solids in the Arnigad stream resulted from the higher organic matter generated in the forest floor. Conclusion: This study shows that rainfall during the wet-period was the main driver of hydrological functioning, whereas, forests provided substantial services by regulating water balance, soil moisture and sediment budget through different mechanisms of forest components at catchment-scale in the Central Himalayan Region.

Performance and carcass characteristics of steers fed with two levels of metabolizable energy intake during summer and winter season	ANIMAL			English	Article						tympanic temperature; muddy conditions; respiration rate; panting scores; climatic factors	HEAT-STRESS; BEEF-CATTLE; QUALITY; COWS; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; FEED	Climate change is producing an increase on extreme weather events around the world such as flooding, drought and extreme ambient temperatures impacting animal production and animal welfare. At present, there is a lack of studies addressing the effects of climatic conditions associated with energy intake in finishing cattle in South American feed yards. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to assess the effects of environmental variables and level of metabolizable energy intake above maintenance requirements (MEI) on performance and carcass quality of steers. In each experiment (winter and summer), steers were fed with 1.85 or 2.72 times of their requirements of metabolizable energy of maintenance. A total of 24 crossbred steers per experiment were used and located in four pens (26.25 m(2)/head) equipped with a Calan Broadbent Feeding System. Animals were fed with the same diet within each season, varying the amount offered to adjust the MEI treatments. Mud depth, mud scores, tympanic temperature (TT), environmental variables, average daily gain, respiration rates and carcass characteristics plus three thermal comfort indices were collected. Data analysis considered a factorial arrangement (Season and MEI). In addition, a repeated measures analysis was performed for TT and respiration rate. Mean values of ambient temperature, solar radiation and comfort thermal indices were greater in the summer experiment as expected (P < 0.005). The mean values of TT were higher in steers fed with higher MEI and also in the summer season. The average daily gain was greater during summer v. winter (1.10 +/- 0.11 v. 0.36 +/- 0.06) kg/day, also when steers were fed 2.72 v. 1.85 MEI level (0.89 +/- 0.12 v. 0.57 +/- 0.10) kg/day. In summer, respiration rate increased in 41.2% in the afternoon. In winter, muddy conditions increased with time of feeding, whereas wind speed and rainfall had significant effects on TT and average daily gain. We conclude that MEI and environmental variables have direct effects on the physiology and performance of steers, including TT and average daily gain, particularly during the winter. In addition, carcass characteristics were affected by season but not by the level of MEI. Finally, due to the high variability of data as well as the small number of animals assessed in these experiments, more studies on carcass characteristics under similar conditions are required.

J	Begam, S; Sen, D				Begam, Sazeda; Sen, Dhrubajyoti			Mapping of moraine dammed glacial lakes and assessment of their areal changes in the central and eastern Himalayas using satellite data	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Glacier retreat; Lakes mapping; Moraine dammed glacial lake (MDGL); Surface area change of lakes; Landsat imagery data; Least criteria decision analysis (LCDA)	REMOTE-SENSING DATA; OUTBURST FLOODS; CATASTROPHIC DRAINAGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; KOSHI BASIN; INVENTORY; EXPANSION; BHUTAN; NEPAL; HAZARDS	The relatively rapid recession of glaciers in the Himalayas and formation of moraine dammed glacial lakes (MDGLs) in the recent past have increased the risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) in the countries of Nepal and Bhutan and in the mountainous territory of Sikkim in India. As a product of climate change and global warming, such a risk has not only raised the level of threats to the habitation and infrastructure of the region, but has also contributed to the worsening of the balance of the unique ecosystem that exists in this domain that sustains several of the highest mountain peaks of the world. This study attempts to present an up to date mapping of the MDGLs in the central and eastern Himalayan regions using remote sensing data, with an objective to analyse their surface area variations with time from 1990 through 2015, disaggregated over six episodes. The study also includes the evaluation for susceptibility of MDGLs to GLOF with the least criteria decision analysis (LCDA). Forty two major MDGLs, each having a lake surface area greater than 0.2 km2, that were identified in the Himalayan ranges of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim, have been categorized according to their surface area expansion rates in space and time. The lakes have been identified as located within the elevation range of 3800 m and 6800 m above mean sea level (a msl). With a total surface area of 37.9 km2, these MDGLs as a whole were observed to have expanded by an astonishing 43.6% in area over the 25 year period of this study. A factor is introduced to numerically sort the lakes in terms of their relative yearly expansion rates, based on their interpretation of their surface area extents from satellite imageries. Verification of predicted GLOF events in the past using this factor with the limited field data as reported in literature indicates that the present analysis may be considered a sufficiently reliable and rapid technique for assessing the potential bursting susceptibility of the MDGLs. The analysis also indicates that, as of now, there are eight MDGLs in the region which appear to be in highly vulnerable states and have high chances in causing potential GLOF events anytime in the recent future.

J	Succarie, A; Xu, ZH; Wang, WJ				Succarie, Amal; Xu, Zhihong; Wang, Wenjie			The variation and trends of nitrogen cycling and nitrogen isotope composition in tree rings: the potential for fingerprinting climate extremes and bushfires	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Bushfires; Climate extremes; Nitrogen; Tree rings delta N-15; Floods; Drought	NATURAL N-15 ABUNDANCE; N-2 FIXATION; SOIL N; GLOBAL PATTERNS; NATIVE FOREST; DELTA-N-15; DYNAMICS; FOLIAGE; PLANT; DELTA-C-13	Purpose Climate extremes, such as droughts and floods, have become intensified and more frequent due to intensifying climate change. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and warming-induced water limitation, as well as climate extremes, may alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems. This provides a brief review of stable nitrogen isotopic composition (delta N-15) in tree ring in relation to climate extremes and bushfires in context of N availability and losses in forest ecosystems. Material and methods Tree rings were extracted from four Pinus sylvestris and four Larix gmelinii sample trees, located in a boreal plantation forest of Mohe City, Heilongjiang Province, China. Tree rings were measured to obtain mean annual basal area increment (BAI), while tree ring delta N-15 and total N concentrations were measured on mass spectrometer at 3-year intervals. The tree ring delta N-15 data were related to possible climate extremes and bushfires. A brief review of the relevant literature was also undertaken to support our preliminary research findings. Results and discussion Globally, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and water limitations have led to a warmer-drier climate. This has also been associated with increases of climate extremes such as drought and floods as well as bushfires. These extremes have been recorded with detrimental effects on plant and soil structures within forest ecosystems and play an important role in regulating N availability and losses in forest ecosystems. Studies of N deposition within forest ecosystems using soil and plant delta N-15 also showed that N losses under various climate extremes can occur through direct changes in N cycling, such as increasing soil nitrification and denitrification or leaching. It is highlighted that tree rings delta N-15 has the potential to fingerprint the intensity and frequency of climate extremes and bushfires in the forest ecosystems, but more such tree ring delta N-15 research needs to be done in diversified forest ecosystems to confirm the potential of using tree ring delta N-15 for quantifying the frequency and intensity of climate extremes and bushfires at both regional and global scale. Conclusion The variation and trend of delta N-15 in the soil-plant-climate systems are closely linked to the N cycling in forest ecosystems, and tree ring delta N-15 has the great potential to fingerprint both intensity and frequency of climate extremes such as drought and floods as well as bushfires.

Existing glacial lake inventories, chiefly created using Landsat satellite imagery, mainly relate to 1990 onwards and relatively long (decadal) temporal scales. Moreover, there is a lack of robust information on the expansion and the GLOF hazard status of glacial lakes in the Bhutan Himalaya. We mapped Bhutanese glacial lakes from the 1960s to 2020, and used these data to determine their distribution patterns, expansion behavior, and GLOF hazard status. 2,187 glacial lakes (corresponding to 130.19 +/- 2.09 km(2)) were mapped from high spatial resolution (1.82-7.62 m), Corona KH-4 images from the 1960s. Using the Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Sentinel-1 (20 m x 22 m), we mapped 2,553 (151.81 +/- 7.76 km(2)), 2,566 (152.64 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,572 (153.94 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,569 (153.97 +/- 7.79 km(2)) and 2,574 (156.63 +/- 7.95 km(2)) glacial lakes in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The glacier-fed lakes were mainly present in the Phochu (22.63%) and the Kurichu (20.66%) basins. A total of 157 glacier-fed lakes have changed into non-glacier-fed lakes over the 60 years of lake evolution. Glacier-connected lakes (which constitutes 42.25% of the total glacier-fed lake) area growth accounted for 75.4% of the total expansion, reaffirming the dominant role of glacier-melt water in expanding glacial lakes. Between 2016 and 2020, 19 (4.82 km(2)) new glacial lakes were formed with an average annual expansion rate of 0.96 km(2) per year. We identified 31 lakes with a very-high and 34 with high GLOF hazard levels. These very-high to high GLOF hazard lakes were primarily located in the Phochu, Kurichu, Drangmechu, and Mochu basins. We concluded that the increasing glacier melt is the main driver of glacial lake expansion. Our results imply that extending glacial lakes studies back to the 1960s provides new insights on glacial lake evolution from glacier-fed lakes to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, we reaffirmed the capacity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine annual glacial lake changes. The results from this study can be a valuable basis for future glacial lake monitoring and prioritizing limited resources for GLOF mitigation programs.

J	Page, J				Page, James			RIVERBED, BANKS AND BEYOND: AN EXAMINATION OF ROMAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INTERVENTIONS IN RESPONSE TO HYDROLOGICAL RISK IN THE PO-VENETIAN PLAIN	PAPERS OF THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT ROME			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOARCHAEOLOGY; VARIABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; OEDENBURG; DYNAMICS; MEGAFANS; CONTEXT; EMILIA; RHINE	Water poses a particular challenge to the cities and settlements of the Po-Venetian plain. The region has some of the highest levels of precipitation in Italy and is criss-crossed by dozens of rivers, including the Po, Adige and Tagliamento. Throughout history, there was considerable hydrological risk to the well-being of riparian communities from hazards such as flooding and lateral channel movement, yet local residents did not sit idly by. This article synthesizes the available evidence for Roman responses to hydrological risk in the Po-Venetian plain from the first century BC to the sixth century AD, examining their workings and the hazards they sought to counteract, integrating them into wider discussions on risk in the Roman world. The responses are divided into the categories of defensive works (embankments and dykes) and channel interventions (channel rectification, channel diversion and dredging). While the effectiveness of these methods is questioned, in particular their potential to cause unintended changes to the watercourse, the decision by riparian communities to undertake them suggests a degree of local success. Nevertheless, an examination of the archaeological and palaeoclimatic evidence suggests a discrepancy between peak intervention and peak risk, implying increasing vulnerability and risk acceptance amongst riparian communities during late antiquity. L'acqua pone una particolare sfida alle citta e agli insediamenti della pianura padano-veneta. La regione e caratterizzata da alcuni tra i piu alti livelli di precipitazioni in Italia ed e attraversata da molti fiumi, tra cui il Po, l'Adige e il Tagliamento. Nel corso della storia, le comunita rivierasche hanno dovuto affrontare un notevole rischio idrologico legato a inondazioni e instabilita dei canali laterali. Gli abitanti dell'area non sono certamente rimasti a guardare. Questo articolo propone una sintesi delle evidenze disponibili relativamente alle risposte romane al rischio idrologico nella pianura padano-veneta dal I secolo a.C. al VI secolo d.C., esaminando il loro funzionamento e i pericoli che hanno cercato di contrastare, integrandole in piu ampie discussioni sul rischio nel mondo romano. Le soluzioni individuate per arginare il rischio idrogeologico sono suddivise nelle categorie di opere difensive (argini e fossati) e interventi di canalizzazione (modifiche e deviazioni dei canali e dragaggio). Sebbene l'efficacia di questi metodi sia stata messa in dubbio, in particolare la loro possibilita di causare cambiamenti non intenzionali al corso d'acqua, la decisione delle comunita rivierasche di adottarli suggerisce un certo grado di successo locale. Tuttavia, un esame delle testimonianze archeologiche e paleoclimatiche suggerisce una discrepanza tra il picco di intervento e il picco di rischio, implicando una crescente vulnerabilita e un'accettazione del rischio tra le comunita rivierasche durante la tarda antichita.

Growth characteristics and yield of contrasting rice genotypes under long-term stagnant flooding	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						Yield formation; Tiller development; Leaf trait; Biomass production; Flooding stress	SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; ORYZA-SATIVA; UNDERWATER PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ELONGATION; ANAEROBIOSIS; GERMINATION; ADAPTATION; AERATION; LEAF; O-2	Context: Stagnant flooding (SF, water depth of 25-50 cm for few weeks to months) is one of the major limiting factors for rice production in humid rainfed areas and is becoming more serious with climate change. Research question: Evaluating growth and yield of rice under SF is essential to develop effective phenotyping approaches for breeding SF-tolerant genotypes to sustain yield gains and ensure food security in affected areas. To date, little attention has been paid for assessing responses of diverse rice genotypes under long-term stagnant flooding in natural fields. Methods: Field experiments were conducted in wet season of 2015 (WS 2015) and dry season of 2016 (DS 2016). Here we evaluated six rice genotypes contrasting in tolerance of complete submergence and SF - Apo, Swarna, Ciherang are sensitive to both submergence and SF, Swarna-Sub1 and Ciherang-Sub1 are sensitive to SF but tolerant of submergence, and IRRI154 is tolerant of SF but sensitive to submergence. Growth, yield and yield attributes were evaluated under water depths of 0 (T1), 5 (T2, control), 30 (T3) and 50 cm (T4) from 14 d after transplanting to maturity. Results: Growth duration of all rice genotypes was prolonged under SF, mainly during vegetative stage. Survival rate, tiller number, crop growth rate and leaf area index (LAI) decreased substantially under SF and with increasing depth of floodwater. However, plant height and specific leaf weight (SLW) remarkably increased under SF. Grain yield decreased progressively with increasing water depth, by 31.6% and 43.3% in the WS 2015, and by 42.9% and 56.8% in the DS 2016, respectively, under T3 and T4. The decline in yield under SF was associated with a significant decrease in number panicles per unit area, spikelets per panicle, grain filling percentage, biomass and harvest index (HI). IRRI154, the SF-tolerant genotype, produced higher grain yield under SF because of its higher survival rate, number of panicles per unit area, and biomass. Sub1 genotypes, SwarnaSub1 and Ciherang-Sub1 had lower grain yield than their non- Sub1 types Swarna and Ciherang under SF. Overall grain yield correlated positively with panicle number, total number of spikelets, crop growth rate, survival, biomass, and HI, but negatively with plant height. Conclusions: Stagnant flooding significantly reduces growth and yield of rice. Both plant height and SLW increased under SF probably as adaptive strategies to increase survival and photosynthetic carbon assimilation per unit leaf area. Greater LAI is more important than thicker leaves under SF. Grain yield decreased progressively with increasing water depth, which was attributed to significant decrease in several yield attributes under SF. The higher survival rate, number of panicles, and biomass production contributed to the highest grain yield of SF-tolerant genotype under SF. Grain yield of the SUB1 genotype was lower than that of their respective nonSUB1 genotype under SF, suggesting that SUB1 should be introduced into varieties that are inherently tall or can sufficiently elongate under SF.

Developing quantifiable approaches for delineating suitable options for irrigating fallow areas during dry season-a case study from Eastern India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Rainwater harvest structures; Runoff; GIS; Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Crop intensity	HARVESTING SITES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; DECISION; GIS; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; LANDS	Harvesting surface runoff during monsoon season for further utilization in crop production during the post-monsoon season is now becoming an effective solution to mitigate water scarcity problems. In this study, multi-criteria analysis-analytic hierarchy process (MCA-AHP)-based approach was envisaged for rainwater harvesting (RWH) zoning for a case study area, i.e., two districts of Odisha state situated in Eastern India. In spite of having a large irrigation network in the study area, major portion of these two densely populated and agriculture dominated districts remains fallow during dry seasons. Suitable locations for RWH structures such as farm pond, check dam, and percolation tanks were identified through Boolean conditions. RWH potential map was generated using different thematic layers namely land use/land cover (LU/LC), geomorphology, slope, stream density, soil type, and surface runoff. AHP-based MCA technique was used to integrate these thematic layers by assigning weights to the thematic layers and ranks to the individual theme features on 1-9 AHP Saaty's scale, considering their relative importance on RWHpotential of the study area. The Natural Resources Conservation Service-CurveNumber method was used to derive surface runoff using Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station rainfall data, satellite-derived LU/LC and FAO soil maps. In comparison to single cropped areas in 48% of the total study area, only 4% area was under double and triple cropped areas during 2016-2017. Moderate runoff was observed in > 50% of the study area dominated by agricultural landscape. Nearly 40%, 25.11%, and 32.45% of the study area indicated very high, high, and moderate RWH potentials, respectively. Particularly, very high RWH potential is observed in the eastern and central portion of the study area. The use of appropriate RWH structures in less irrigated areas will facilitate multiple cropping and will substitute the use of subsurface water harvesting practices. In these two districts, 73 check dams and 153 percolation tanks are prescribed along the 2nd- and 3rd-order streams. In coarser textured soil, nearly 306 km(2) and 608 km(2) areas are identified as moderate and highly suitable zones for percolation tank construction on ground, while in fine soil, around 786 km(2) area is identified as suitable for farm pond construction. Majority of the suitable zones for percolation tanks is found in Jajpur district, while suitability for adoption of farm pond and check dam is more in Bhadrak district. It is expected that implementation of the prescribed RWH structures can mitigate the threats of flood, drought, soil erosion, and enhance the soil moisture and cropping intensity significantly. The use of GIS platform with the spatial layers and the methodology adopted can be updated and replicated in larger regions in a shorter time. The spatially explicit maps are offering insights to different themes, providing useful information to the water resource managers, and may improve the decision-making process.	[Behera, M.

In recent decades, the mortality of the Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica) along the Tarim River in Northwest China has increased. However, few studies have quantified the causes of mortality and regeneration in this azonal riparian forest type. Methods The present study describes the annual hydrological response of tree mortality and regeneration in forest gaps. A total of 60 canopy gaps were investigated in six replicate grid plots (50 m x 50 m) and the annual runoff and water consumption data during the period of 1955-2016 were collected from hydrological stations in the middle reaches of the Tarim River. We compared the regeneration density of seedlings and saplings within the canopy gap areas (CGAs), undercanopy areas (UCAs), and uncovered riverbank areas (RBAs) through detailed field investigation. Results Our study found that the mortality of young and middle-aged gap makers has increased remarkably over recent decades, particularly since the year 1996. The main results indicated that regional water scarcity was the primary limiting factor for long-term changes in tree mortality, as shown by a significant correlation between the diameter at breast height (DBH) of dead trees and the annual surface water. The average density (or regeneration rate) of seedlings and saplings was highest in the RBAs, intermediate in the CGAs, and lowest in the UCAs. Compared with the UCAs, the CGAs promote tree regeneration to some extent by providing favorable conditions for the survival and growth of seedlings and saplings, which would otherwise be suppressed in the understory. Furthermore, although the density of seedlings and saplings in the CGAs was not as high as in the RBAs, the survival rate was higher in the CGAs than in the RBAs. Conclusion Forest canopy gaps in floodplain areas can play a decisive role in the long-term germination and regeneration of plant species. However, as a typical phreatophyte in this hyper-arid region, the ecosystem structure, functions and services of this fragile P. euphratica floodplain forests are threatened by a continuous decrease of water resources, due to excessive water use for agricultural irrigation, which has resulted in a severe reduction of intact poplar forests. Furthermore, the survival of seedlings and saplings is influenced by light availability and soil water at the regional scale. Our findings suggest that policymakers may need to reconsider the restoration and regeneration measures implemented in riparian P. euphratica forests to improve flood water efficiency and create canopy gaps. Our results provide with valuable reference information for the conservation and sustainable development of floodplain forest ecosystems.

J	Mukherjee, S; Mishra, AK				Mukherjee, Sourav; Mishra, Ashok Kumar			Cascading effect of meteorological forcing on extreme precipitation events: Role of atmospheric rivers in southeastern US	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Atmospheric rivers; Coastal SEUS; Extreme precipitation; Cascading effect; Synoptic patterns; Moisture advection	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEST-COAST; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL EVENTS; UNITED-STATES; IMPACTS; FLOODS; SATELLITE; FREQUENCY; MOISTURE	The past few decades have witnessed an intensification of extreme precipitation (EP) events triggered by atmospheric rivers (ARs), leading to massive flooding, highlighting the importance of studying the physical mechanisms associated with these types of events. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of ARs and related extreme precipitation (AR-EP) events, and the cascading effect of the synoptic-scale meteorological patterns on underlying processes in the Coastal States of the Southeastern United States (SUES) during the 1979-2019 period. The seasonal frequency of EP events associated with ARs suggests that more frequent AR-EP events occur during the colder months (November to April). In contrast, the AR-EP events are less frequent but more severe in the warmer months (May to October). A total of 12-15 AR-EP events, with severity exceeding the 99th percentile precipitation threshold, were observed during the 3-month overlapping seasons between November and April from 1979 to 2019 that affected Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and South Carolina. On the other hand, the average precipitation magnitude of the AR-EP events is relatively higher (55-90 mm/day) in the warmer months (May to October). To explore the cascading nature of relevant meteorological forcing on the physical processes that favor such events, we performed an event-centered composite analysis based on the top 100 severe AR-EP events observed during the extended cold and warm season, separately. It was observed that during the progression of the AR-EP events, the anomalies associated with composite mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and 850mb geopotential height (Z850) make a transition from the trough to ridge formation along with a south-eastward extension of Bermuda High in the cold season. The spatiotemporal evolution of these meteorological variables is found to have a cascading effect on the mode of moisture transport indicated by integrated vapor transport (IVT) and moisture availability shown by total column water vapor associated with the major AR-EP events. The warm season IVT field gets stronger 2-days before the AR-EP event occurrences indicating a continuous increase in moisture influx into the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains. Similar strengthening of IVT is noted over the Gulf Coastal Plains during the cold season. A cascading effect is also noted for the moisture availability indicated by a significant increase in total column water vapor (TCWV) over the Gulf of Mexico 2 days before the events. Overall, the cold season AR-EPs are driven by relatively stronger dynamical systems indicated by greater IVT intensity. In contrast, the warm season AR-EPs are associated with a weaker IVT field, higher atmospheric instability, and more moist conditions.

J	Vu, DH; Stuerz, S; Asch, F				Vu, Duy Hoang; Stuerz, Sabine; Asch, Folkard			Nutrient uptake and assimilation under varying day and night root zone temperatures in lowland rice	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						fertilizer management; nitrogen assimilation; nitrogen uptake; Oryza sativa; vapor pressure deficit	NITRATE REDUCTASE-ACTIVITY; LOW WATER TEMPERATURE; AMINO-ACID CONTENTS; NITROGEN UPTAKE; DIURNAL CHANGES; SHOOT DEMAND; GROWTH; PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TRANSPIRATION	Background:In flooded rice fields, root zone temperatures (RZT) are buffered by the ponded water layer. With global warming, a higher frequency of hot days and hot nights, and the introduction of water-saving irrigation technologies, RZT are likely to vary more widely, particularly between night and day. Aim:It is not known how this will affect nutrient uptake of rice, particularly if the climate-driven transpirational demand increases simultaneously, since nutrient uptake at least partly depends on water uptake. Methods:We investigated the effects of day and night RZT on water and nutrient uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism under low and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Plants of two rice varieties (IR64 and NU838) were grown hydroponically at three root temperature levels (19, 24, and 29 degrees C). For a period of seven days, fresh weight of the plants, nutrient contents of the nutrient solution (NH4+,NO3-,PO43-, K+), and water uptake were measured both at the end of the light period and at the end of the dark period. Nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), and amino acid (AA) concentrations in the youngest fully developed leaves were examined on the last day and night of the experiment. Results:The share of day and night uptake ofNH4+andNO3-depended on RZT, whereas K(+)uptake was higher during the day independent of RZT. Under low VPD,PO43-uptake rate did not differ between day and night, however, under high VPD, the uptake ofPO43-varied between varieties and RZTs. Water uptake of the plants was strongly influenced by VPD, but not by RZT. In contrast, nutrient uptake was hardly influenced by VPD and did not correlate with water uptake, but linearly increased with RZT with an optimum temperature for nutrient uptake above 29 degrees C. This increase was larger forNH4+andNO3-than forPO43-and K(+)shifting the nutrient requirements of rice. While the increase of nutrient uptake per degrees C did not differ between varieties under low VPD, IR64 showed a greater increase in nutrient uptake to RZT at day-time, whereas NU838 showed a greater increase at night-time under high VPD. The activities of NR and GS seemed to respond to the total daily N uptake rather than to different uptake rates during day or night, while AA concentration was strongly correlated to N uptake during the day. Conclusions:With an optimum RZT for nutrient uptake above 29 degrees C, rice plants could benefit from temperature increase caused by either different water management strategies or climate change if fertilizer management was adapted to the new, shifted requirements.

J	Tan, KW; Loh, PN; Huang, YF				Tan, Kok Weng; Phui Nying Loh; Huang, Yuk Feng			DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE HAZARDS DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM: A STUDY OF CAMERON HIGHLANDS, MALAYSIA	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Climate hazards; decision support system; Cameron Highlands Malaysia		Cameron Highlands is one of agricultural areas in Peninsular Malaysia. Changing climate has brought threats to this highland region and caused number of climate related disasters such as landslides and floods in recent years. These devastated extreme events had affected the socioeconomic of the local community. The main purpose of this study is to develop a climate hazard decision support system (DSS) for Cameron Highlands based on the driving forces, pressures, states, impacts and responses (DPSIR) framework. It aims to support stakeholders on the land use development and climate hazard reduction in Cameron Highlands. A case study approach was adopted whereas qualitative and quantitative methods were applied in the study. The methods chosen for this study were literature review, data collection, statistical analysis and synthesis, and climate hazard decision support system development. Apart from literature review, local community opinion survey, expertise interview and statistical analysis were the main research activities. Statistical analyses that are most appropriate in data interpretation were determined in the planning phase of this study. Three statistical analyses were carried out namely reliability test, principal component analysis (PCA) and sensitivity analysis. Indicators were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA). Each indicator was then given weightage based on expertise input to form a composite index. The pre-defined indicators were then given a weightage and rating by the 11 experts from different institutions. Reliability analysis was conducted and the Cronbach's alpha value of 0.952 (where alpha > 0.70) was obtained in this study. It indicated a high level of internal consistency of survey outcomes. Based on the survey outcomes, total 25 indicators were extracted using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). These indicators were grouped into 13 subcomponents which are population, solid waste, land use changes, flood disaster, developments/investment opportunities, climate change indicators, health and sanitation, soil quality, disasters/mass movements, socioeconomic, environmental quality, private and public sectors, and individuals. With the outcomes of PCA and experts interview, weightage for each indicator was determined and further aggregated into a decision support system conceptual model as HADSS ver.1.0. Primary data was collected in order to pilot run the HADSS 1.0. It generated an output of -0.5573 and indicated that Cameron Highlands may be deteriorating and at high risk of climate hazards. The standardised beta value of sensitivity test for indicators was obtained as 0.967. The high beta value for indicators means that they are sensitive to changes of the model. The main contribution of HADSS ver.1.0 is to advise and aware the stakeholders about the contribution of their environmental, economic, and social impacts to sustainable development. This increases the transparency in decision making especially local plan development when everyone is involved and played their roles. The HADSS ver. 1.0 also provides a new solution to climate hazards in Cameron Highlands (floods and landslides) and demonstrating the solution's efficacy.

J	Whipple, AA; Viers, JH				Whipple, A. A.; Viers, J. H.			Coupling landscapes and river flows to restore highly modified rivers	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Review						river restoration; habitat restoration; environmental flows; hydrogeomorphology; process based; highly modified rivers	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; FRESH-WATER; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; LAND-USE; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; WETLAND CONNECTIVITY; HABITAT RESTORATION; STREAM RESTORATION; REGULATED RIVERS	Modifications to landscapes and flow regimes of rivers have altered the function, biodiversity, and productivity of freshwater ecosystems globally. Reestablishing geomorphological and hydrological conditions necessary to sustain ecosystems is a central challenge for restoration within highly altered systems. Meeting this challenge requires simultaneously addressing multiple and interacting stressors within the context of irreversible changes and socio-economic constraints. Traditionally, river restoration approaches either physically change the landscape or channel (channel-floodplain manipulation) or adjust hydrology (environmental flows), and such actions are often independent. We juxtapose these two subfields of river restoration, which have undergone parallel transformations, from goals of reproducing static representations of form and flow regime to goals of reestablishing processes. The parallel transformations have generated shared ideas, which point to benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and environmental flow actions to achieve process-based goals. Such coupling supports comprehensive river restoration efforts aimed at supporting resilient ecosystems within human dominated landscapes in a nonstationary climate. We identify four elements of coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers: (1) identify physical and ecological process potential given interactive effects of altered landscapes and flows; (2) consider capacity for sustaining identified processes under potential future change; (3) model alternatives for coupled restoration actions to support identified processes; and (4) evaluate alternatives using metrics representing integrative effects of coupled actions. We suggest these emergent elements contribute to the development of standard practices for restoring highly modified rivers and encourage an increasing number and quality of coupled applications. Plain Language Summary Freshwater ecosystems globally have been fundamentally altered and degraded by multiple human modifications of rivers, which have affected the amount and timing of water availability as well as the riverine landscape with which river flows interact. Knowing that it is often impossible or infeasible to completely reverse these impacts, a central challenge for restoring freshwater ecosystems of highly modified rivers is to determine what water management changes and physical habitat restoration actions can be taken to reestablish processes necessary to support ecosystems. These different river restoration approaches have traditionally been considered independently of one another. However, both river restoration subfields have shifted in recent decades from goals of reproducing static representations of channel forms or reference flow regimes to those of reestablishing processes driven by flow-landscape interaction. This shared understanding points to the benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and water management for a combined added positive impact to ecosystems. Four elements of coupled approaches are identified: (1) identify process potential; (2) consider capacity under potential future change; (3) model alternatives; and (4) evaluate metrics of integrative effects. This commentary supports the development of standard practices for coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers.	[Whipple, A.

J	Wang, ZL; Lin, L; Yang, ML; Guo, Z				Wang, Zhili; Lin, Lei; Yang, Meilin; Guo, Zhun			The Role of Anthropogenic Aerosol Forcing in Interdecadal Variations of Summertime Upper-Tropospheric Temperature Over East Asia	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; REACTIVE GASES; NORTH-ATLANTIC; MONSOON; EMISSIONS; RESPONSES; RAINFALL; BIAS	Observations show a significant interdecadal decline of July and August (JA) mean upper-tropospheric temperature (UTT) over East Asia during the second half of the twentieth century, which is likely responsible for the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and the "southern flood and northern drought" phenomenon observed in eastern China. This study investigates the role of anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the interdecadal cooling for the period 1951-2001 and the physical mechanisms involved using a coupled Earth system model, combined with reanalysis data. Our results show that the aerosol forcing leads to a drop of 0.14 degrees C per decade in JA mean UTT averaged over East Asia (30-45 degrees N, 90-130 degrees E), which significantly contributes to the observed cooling of 0.2 degrees C per decade. The interdecadal cooling may be attributed to the weakening of interhemispheric differences in JA mean sea surface temperature in response to aerosols. The asymmetric hemispheric change in sea surface temperature alters the local eddy flux, thereby weakening upper-tropospheric westerlies and the transport of warm air from over the Tibetan plateau into downstream regions between 30 degrees N and 40 degrees N. We further find that changes in the geographic distribution of SO 2 emissions are the dominant cause of differences in JA mean UTT trends over East Asia between decades. The projected decrease in anthropogenic aerosols will lead to a rise of 0.05 degrees C per decade in JA mean UTT over East Asia during 2010-2050 under the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 scenario. This will likely have large impacts on the distribution of summer precipitation in East Asia in the future. Plain Language Summary In the context of global warming, there are different levels of interdecadal cooling in the upper troposphere in most regions of Eurasia north of 30 degrees N in July and August (JA) during the second half of the twentieth century. The cooling trends are significant over midlatitude East Asia from 90 degrees E to 130 degrees E and 30 degrees N to 45 degrees N, which is likely responsible for the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and the "southern flood and northern drought" phenomenon observed in eastern China in the past few decades. However, the specific reasons for the decline in upper-tropospheric temperature remain subject to debate. Our study reveals that anthropogenic aerosol forcing significantly contributes to the observed interdecadal JA mean upper-tropospheric cooling over East Asia. The reversal of the interdecadal JA mean upper-tropospheric temperature trend over East Asia will occur in the future due to the expected decrease in anthropogenic aerosol burdens. This will likely have significant effects on the spatial distribution of summer precipitation over East Asia. This study has implications for better understanding the mechanism of climate change.

A Review of Hydrological Studies in the United Arab Emirates	WATER			English	Review						cloud seeding; floods; groundwater; hydrology; literature review; rainfall; the UAE	PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS; EASTERN REGION; RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; WATER; CITY	The increasing interest in hydrological studies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has resulted in the publication of several papers on hydrology and its broad use for addressing contemporaneous challenges confronting humans and the environment in the region. However, for several reasons, these efforts have remained invisible and unrecognized. This paper has reviewed the literature on hydrological research in the UAE to provide a comprehensive source of information for researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The documented studies were carefully selected, relying on a bibliometric analysis methodology of five phases to specify the boundary of the study area, adopt the primary keywords for the search, evaluate the obtained papers, exclude the non-conforming ones, and classify the final results into four distinguished topics-namely, rainfall analysis, urban growth and flood hazards, cloud seeding and changing climate, and groundwater situation and utilization. The evaluation process considered assessing the papers' relevancy, authenticity, and coverage of the main issues of interest. In all, a total of 50 published papers were identified based on the specified criteria and reviewed. The main findings were first that the amount of rainfall over the UAE has been declining in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue, although intensities are rising, suggesting shorter duration events. Secondly, the extensive urban growth in the country has resulted in increasing incidences of urban floods and declining groundwater recharge. Both of these are to be expected as consequences of the increased imperviousness from urbanization and the higher intensities from shorter-duration rainfall events. Thirdly, although the cloud-seeding program has proved to be successful in increasing precipitation amounts, the impact of this on flooding due to more extreme rainfall intensities and on air quality remains worrisome. Finally, groundwater analyses have shown that it is still the main freshwater resource in the country, but its long-term sustainability and quality are being threatened by the declining recharge. This calls for a national policy for groundwater management in the UAE to tackle the challenges associated with the increasing demand for water in all sectors of the economy.

Substantial research has been carried out in the past on the detection and assessment of HMHs and their derived risks. Yet, knowledge on the performance and functioning of NbS to address these hazards is severely lacking. The latter is exacerbated by the lack of practical and viable approaches that would help identify and select NbS for specific problems. The EUfunded OPERANDUM project established seven Open-Air Laboratories (OALs) across Europe to co-develop, test, and generate an evidence base from innovative NbS deployed to address HMHs such as flooding, droughts, landslides, erosion, and eutrophication. Herein, we detail the original approaches that each OAL followed in the process of identifying and selecting NbS for specific hazards with the aim of proposing a novel, generic framework for selecting NbS. We found that the process of selecting NBS was overall complex and context-specific in all the OALs, and it comprised 26 steps distributed across three stages: (i) Problem recognition, (ii) NbS identification, and (iii) NbS selection. We also identified over 20 selection criteria which, in most cases, were shared across OALs and were chiefly related to sustainability aspects. All the identified NbS were related to the regulation of the water cycle, and they were mostly chosen according to three main factors: (i) hazard type, (ii) hazard scale, and (iii) OAL size. We noticed that OALs exposed to landslides and erosion selected NbS capable to manage water budgets within the soil compartment at the local or landscape scale, while OALs exposed to floods, droughts, and eutrophication selected approaches to managing water transport and storage at the catchment scale. We successfully portrayed a synthesis of the stages and steps followed in the OALs' NbS selection process in a framework. The framework, which reflects the experiences of the stakeholders involved, is inclusive and integrated, and it can serve as a basis to inform NbS selection processes whilst facilitating the organisation of diverse stakeholders working towards finding solutions to natural hazards. We animate the future development of the proposed framework by integrating financial viability steps. We also encourage studies looking into the implementation of the proposed framework through quantitative approaches integrating multi -criteria analyses.

An Analysis of Precipitation Extreme Events Based on the SPI and EDI Values in the Free State Province, South Africa	WATER			English	Article						drought; extreme; frequency; duration; drought indices; EDI; SPI; extreme value analysis (EVA); extreme frequency analysis (EFA)	FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT; TRENDS; INDEX; RISK; QUANTIFICATION; SETTLEMENTS; STREAMFLOW	Recognizing that, over the last several years, extreme rainfall has led to hazardous stress in humans, animals, plants, and even infrastructure, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of droughts over the Free State (FS) Province of South Africa in order to determine the future likelihood of reoccurrences of precipitation extremes using the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) and extreme frequency analysis (EFA). In this regard, daily rainfall datasets from nine South African weather service homogenous climatic districts, spanning from 1980 to 2019, were used to compute: (a) the total annual rainfall, (b) the Effective Drought Index (EDI), and (c) the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI was calculated for 3, 6, and 12 month accumulation periods (hereafter SPI-3, SPI-6, and SPI-12, respectively). The trend analysis results of the EDI and SPI-3, -6, and -12 showed that the Free State Province is generally negative, illustrating persistent drought. An analysis of the GEV parameters across the EDI and SPI-3, -6, and -12 values illustrated that the location, scale, and shape parameters exhibited a noticeable spatial variability across the Free State Province with the location parameter largely negative, the scale parameter largely positive, while the shape parameter pointed to an inherent Type III (Weibull) GEV distribution. In addition, the return levels for the drought/wet duration and severity of the EDI and SPI-3, -6, and -12 values generally showed increasing patterns across the corresponding return periods; the spatial contrasts were only noticeable in the return levels derived from the wet/drought duration and severity derived from SPI-3, -6, and -12 values (and not in the EDI). Further, the EFA results pointed to a noticeable spatial contrast in the return periods derived from the EDI and SPI-3, -6, and -12 values for each of the extreme precipitation categories: moderately wet, severely wet, extremely wet to moderately dry, and severely dry. Over four decades, the FS Province has generally experienced a suite of extreme precipitation categories ranging from moderately wet, severely wet, extremely wet to moderately dry, severely dry, and extremely dry conditions. Overall, the present study contributes towards implementation of effective drought early warning systems and can be used to enhance drought related policy and decision making in support of water resource management and planning in the FS Province.

J	Qiu, HY; Zhou, JZ; Chen, L; Zhu, YX				Qiu, Hongya; Zhou, Jianzhong; Chen, Lu; Zhu, Yuxin			Multiple Strategies Based Salp Swarm Algorithm for Optimal Operation of Multiple Hydropower Reservoirs	WATER			English	Article						multiple hydropower reservoirs; hydropower generation; flood control; optimal operation; salp swarm algorithm	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; INSPIRED OPTIMIZER; SYSTEMS	Reasonable optimal operation policy for complex multiple reservoir systems is very important for the safe and efficient utilization of water resources. The operation policy of multiple hydropower reservoirs should be optimized to maximize total hydropower generation, while ensuring flood control safety by effective and efficient storage and release policy of multiple reservoirs. To achieve this goal, a new meta-heuristic algorithm, salp swarm algorithm (SSA), is used to optimize the joint operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs for the first time. SSA is a competitive bio-inspired optimizer, which has received substantial attention from researchers in a wide variety of applications in finance, engineering, and science because of its little controlling parameters and adaptive exploratory behavior. However, it still faces few drawbacks such as lack of exploitation and local optima stagnation, leading to a slow convergence rate. In order to tackle these problems, multiple strategies combining sine cosine operator, opposition-based learning mechanism, and elitism strategy are applied to the original SSA. The sine cosine operator is applied to balance the exploration and exploitation over the course of iteration; the opposition-based learning mechanism is used to enhance the diversity of the swarm; and the elitism strategy is adopted to find global optima. Then, the improved SSA (ISSA) is compared with six well-known meta-heuristic algorithms on 23 classical benchmark functions. The results obtained demonstrate that ISSA outperforms most of the well-known algorithms. Then, ISSA is applied to optimal operation of multiple hydropower reservoirs in the real world. A multiple reservoir system, namely Xiluodu Reservoir and Xiangjiaba Rservoir, in the upper Yangtze River of China are selected as a case study. The results obtained show that the ISSA is able to solve a real-world optimization problem with complex constraints. In addition, for the typical flood with a 100 return period in 1954, the maximum hydropower generation of multiple hydropower reservoirs is about 6671 GWh in the case of completing the flood control task, increasing by 1.18% and 1.77% than SSA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), respectively. Thus, ISSA can be used as an alternative effective and efficient tool for the complex optimization of multiple hydropower reservoirs. The water resources in the river basin can be further utilized by the proposed method to cope with the increasingly serious climate change.

Lake Unterer Soiernsee is affected by marked water-level fluctuations and is light-penetrated to the bottom most of the year, while Lake Oberer Soiernsee provides more stable conditions and an extended aphotic zone. Mixed samples of epiphytic, epilithic, epipsammic and epipelic periphyton were taken in one-meter depth steps by scuba divers. Most of the common benthic diatoms occurred in distinct depth-areas. RDA analyses showed that depth was strongly correlated with species distribution in both lakes. Depth-constrained cluster analyses indicated three distinct diatom community zones in each lake. A shallow littoral zone hosting mainly epiphytic and epilithic species and a deeper littoral zone with mainly epipsammic and epipelic taxa existed in both lakes. Additionally, a highly disturbed near-shore littoral zone with diatoms adapted to unstable conditions (aerophilic taxa, pioneer species) was found in Lake Unterer Soiernsee, and a deep-water pelagic zone with mainly planktonic taxa in Lake Oberer Soiernsee. Light availability, substrate, physical stressors and nutrient concentrations were linked closely with water depth. While light availability affected the ratio of benthic and planktonic diatoms, substrate type influenced benthic diatom assemblage structures. Diatoms occurring in surficial sediments of the aphotic zone represent an ideal cross-section of the recent diatom assemblage of the lake, including benthic and planktonic species. However, sediment samples taken in light-flooded depths are inappropriate for studies based on shifts between benthic and planktonic taxa, becausein situbenthic species dominate the surface-sediment assemblages, while settled tychoplanktonic and planktonic species occur less frequently. A diatom-inferred depth model was created for each lake to prove the usability for down-core studies using weighted-averaging approaches. For both lakes these models are highly appropriate to reconstruct past fluctuations in water-transparency or lake-level. With regard to the development of diatom-based TP-transfer-functions for Bavarian mountain lakes, we found it is highly important to consider lake depth and transparency. Based on the findings of this study we recommend the creation of two different training-sets, one for deep or low-transparency lakes with an aphotic zone including both benthic and planktonic diatoms, and another one for shallow, clear water lakes solely using benthic diatoms.

The model results are evaluated for their ability to reproduce the fluxes of DOC and carbon dioxide (CO2) along the soil-inland-water continuum and the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, including the evasion outgassing of CO2 from inland waters. We present simulation results over the years 1901-2007 and show that the model is able to broadly reproduce observed state variables and their emergent properties across a range of interacting physical and biogeochemical processes. These include (1) net primary production (NPP), respiration and riverine hydrologic amplitude, seasonality, and inter-annual variation; (2) DOC concentrations, bulk annual flow, and their volumetric attribution at the sub-catchment level; (3) high headwater versus downstream CO2 evasion, an emergent phenomenon consistent with observations over a spectrum of high-latitude observational studies. These quantities obey emergent relationships with environmental variables like air temperature and topographic slope that have been described in the literature. This gives us confidence in reporting the following additional findings: of the similar to 34 TgC yr(-1) left over as input to soil matter after NPP is diminished by heterotrophic respiration, 7 TgC yr(-1) is leached and transported into the aquatic system. Of this, over half (3.6 Tg C yr(-1) is evaded from the inland water surface back into the atmosphere and the remainder (3.4 Tg Cyr(-1) flushed out into the Arctic Ocean, mirroring empirically derived studies. These riverine DOC exports represent similar to 1.5% of NPP. DOC exported from the floodplains is dominantly sourced from recent more "labile" terrestrial production in contrast to DOC leached from the rest of the watershed with runoff and drainage, which is mostly sourced from recalcitrant soil and litter. All else equal, both historical climate change (a spring-summer warming of 1.8 degrees C over the catchment) and rising atmospheric CO2 (+C85.6 ppm) are diagnosed from factorial simulations to contribute similar significant increases in DOC transport via primary production, although this similarity may not hold in the future.

In the Atlantic Margin of the Iberian Peninsula, Picos de Europa mountains is among of the most important karst areas of the World containing some of the deepest caves explored today. In addition, these mountains represent a reference site for the study of the Last Glacial Cycle in the SW of Europe. This work aims to reconstruct the Pliocene-Quaternary evolution of this region based on geomorphological and geochronological research (U/Th and Al/Be) carried out in four alpine caves. Cave geomorphological mapping evidences that 12 km of studied caves are made up of 47% vadose canyons and shafts, 45% phreatic/epiphreatic conduits organised in six cave levels, and 7% breakdown-modified passages. Their deposits are characterized by speleothems, including fiowstones, that represent ancient cave pavements, fluvial terrace deposits with allochthonous clasts, slackwater deposits related to cave floods, and debris deposits produced by breakdown. One Al-26/Be-10 burial age indicates a minimum age of 2.1 +/- 0.5 Ma for the caves origin, allowing estimation of the mountain uplift at 0.15-0.25 mm.a(-1) since the Late Pliocene. Twenty-eight new U-234/Th-23 ages and another six previous speleothem ages give ages ranging from MIS 8 to 1. The speleogenetic model comprises six phases of regional evolution. Phase 1: main development of cave levels with SE-directed phreatic flow in the NW of Picos de Europa, in a karst partially or totally covered by the detrital Permian-Mesozoic cover, presently eroded. Phase 2: erosion of the Permian-Mesozoic cover and onset of vadose conditions before 260 ka, in a karst-affected by fluvial captures. Phase 3: cave infill during 220-145 ka, probably caused by the erosion of Stephanian detrital outcrops. Phase 4: erosion of cave infill during 125-45 ka. Phase 5: apparent pause in the speleothem formation during 45-25 ka related to dry and cold regional conditions. Phase 6: reactivation of the speleothem precipitation since 25 ka. Regional climate, fluvial incision and the ancient presence of detrital outcrops at the surface appear to have been the main factors that controlled the cave evolution and regional geomorphological evolution throughout Pliocene and Quatemary times.

But establishing the impact of hydroclimate is complicated by the influences of other processes and is especially hard to prove for those in deep time from geological record. During the late Permian, voluminous basaltic sediments were derived from the erosion of the Emeishan large igneous province in western South China. They provide a unique record critical in understanding the responses of tropical basaltic erosion to hydroclimate change without impacts of orogenic uplift, lithologic variation, vegetational difference and glacial-interglacial change. Sampled successions define a negative carbon isotope excursion capable of making regional and global stratigraphic correlations in the middle Wuchiapingian interval corresponding to the final phase of the late Paleozoic ice age. This interval is associated with a petrofacies shift and a decreasing source weathering intensity, a downward shift of erosion loci, and a reduced coastal water paleosalinity. Applying present-day temperature dependence pattern of basaltic weathering and using land surface temperatures approximated from nearby paleo-seawaters, denudation rates were calculated for the Emeishan basaltic province and shows an increase from similar to 71 to similar to 107 m/Ma. This erosional acceleration is temporally correlated with a decrease in paleosalinity and likely linked to enhanced freshwater discharge in the middle Wuchiapingian. Scaling and landscape erosion modeling suggest similar to 80%-130% increase in catchment precipitation could have driven this acceleration in denudation. Our work provides a positive test for the hydroclimate forcing on landscape erosion in deep time and underlines the mechanistic linkage of sediments with erosion and climate change. Sedimentary records provide a unique way to track source weathering and erosion in the deep geological past. During the late Permian to early Triassic voluminous basaltic sediments were eroded from the Emeishan large igneous province, which was emplaced at ca. 260 Ma in southwestern China, into the adjacent basins. These late Permian sedimentary records are studied to understand the denudation of this tropical basalt province in the final period of the late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA). Our data reveal a negative organic carbon isotope excursion, decreasing weathering intensity and deepening erosional loci in the Emeishan basaltic province, and a reduced salinity due to greater rainfall in the middle Wuchiapingian interval. Denudation rate was estimated for the Emeishan province and a correlation of high denudation rates with lowered paleosalinity was documented in the Wuchiapingian. The accelerated denudation in the Emeishan basaltic province was ascribed to similar to 80%-130% increase in catchment precipitation during the final phase of the late Paleozoic ice age. This work highlights the importance of sedimentary records to understand the deep time landscape evolution.

Consequently, many regions of the coast are at increased risk of erosion and flooding. Therefore coastal protection schemes will increase in cost and scale. In response there is a growing use of nature-based coastal protection which aim to be sustainable, effective and adaptable. An example of a nature-based solution is a dynamic cobble berm revetment: a berm constructed from cobble and other gravel sediments at the high tide wave runup limit. These structures limit wave excursion protecting the hinterland from inundation, stabilise the upper beach and adapt to changes in water level. Recent experiments and field applications have shown the suitability of these structures for coastal protection, however many of the processes and design considerations are poorly understood. This study directly compares two prototype scale laboratory experiments which tested dynamic cobble berm revetments constructed with approximately the same geometry but differing gravel characteristics; well-sorted rounded gravel (DynaRev1) and poorly-sorted angular gravel (DynaRev2). In both cases the structures were tested using identical wave forcing including incrementally increasing water level and erosive wave conditions. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that both designs responded to changing water level and wave conditions by approaching a dynamically stable state, where individual gravel is mobilised under wave action but the geometry remains approximately constant. Further, both structures acted to reduce swash excursions compared to a pure sand beach. However, their morphological behaviour is response to wave action varied considerably. Once overtopping of the designed crest occurred, the poorly-sorted revetment developed a peaked crest which grew in elevation as the water level or wave height increased, further limited overtopping. By comparison, the well-sorted revetment was characterised by a larger volume of submerged gravel and a lower elevation flat crest which responded less well to changes in conditions. This occurred due to two processes: (1) for the poorly-sorted case, gravel sorting processes moved small to medium gravel material (D50 < 70 mm) to the crest and (2) the angular nature of the poorly-sorted gravel material promoted increased interlocking. Both of these processes led to a gravel matrix that is more resistant to wave action and gravitational effects. Both revetments experienced some sinking due to sand erosion beneath the front slope. The rate of sinking for the well-sorted case was larger and continued throughout due to the large pore spaces within the gravel matrix. For the poorly sorted revetment in DynaRev2, sand erosion ceased after approximately 28 h due to the development of a filter layer of small gravel at the sand-gravel interface reducing porosity at this location, hence a larger volume of sand was preserved beneath the structure. Both designs present a low-cost and effective solution for protecting sandy coastlines but from an engineering viewpoint it appears better to avoid well-sorted gravel material and greater gravel angularity has been seen to increase crest stability.

Evidence from the sedimentary record, grain sizes, and pollen provides a paleoenvironmental history of the Late Pleistocene from the boreholes of the delta. Based on a combination of grain-size analysis with lithological studies, marine deposit units contain the intervals of 13.85-16.9, 18.5-19.69, 27.9-34.8, 36.4-37.2, 48.4-51.6, and 54.1-55.9 m, and transitional facies units contain the intervals of 10.25-13.85, 16.9-18.5, 19.69-27.9, 34.8-36.4, 37.2-48.4, 51.6-54.1, and 55.9-60 m, compared with fluvial (terrestrial facies) deposit units (3.36-10.25 m). Based on pollen analysis and pollen assemblages, there were three warm-wet periods from 9.1-0.16 ka BP, 16.1-60 ka BP, and 90.1-94.6 ka BP From the top to the bottom of the borehole, the paleoclimate has an evident fluctuation: warm and moist (Holocene Optimum) -cool and dry (Younger Dryas Event)-mild semi cool-cool and dry-warm and moist. There were three warm-wet periods from 9.1-0.16 ka BP, 16.1-60 ka BP, and 90.1-94.6 ka BP, corresponding to the Holocene Optimum stage, MIS 3, and MIS 5, respectively. The warm period allowed monsoonal evergreen and broadleaved deciduous forests that corresponded to Holocene hypsithermal climatic conditions and the Late Pleistocene climatic Optimum. Three warm-wet periods occurred in marine deposit units from 9.1-0.16 ka BP, 60.1-16.1 ka BP, and 94.6-90.1 ka BP. These periods correspond to the Cangzhou transgression, Xianxian transgression, and Huanghua transgression, respectively. From 90.1-60.1 ka BP, 17.5-9.1 ka BP, and 0. 16 ka BP-1855 AD, three dry and cold phases are recognized. The phases indicate the fluvial (flood plain) sedimentary environment, corresponding to cooler and mild dry periods based on palynological results and grain-size distribution.

J	Klumb, EK; Braga, EJB; Bianchi, VJ				Klumb, Elsa Kuhn; Bolacel Braga, Eugenia Jacira; Bianchi, Valmor Joao			Differential expression of genes involved in the response of <i>Prunus</i> spp. rootstocks under soil flooding	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Hypoxia; Gas exchange; Peach; Plum; RT-qPCR; Abiotic stress	TOLERANCE; STRESS; ROOT; ACCLIMATIONS; METABOLISM; ETHYLENE; SURVIVAL	The State of Rio Grande do Sul is used to produce the largest volume of peaches in Brazil. However, productivity in the state is lower than elsewhere in the country. One of the challenges faced by producers in the area is the occurrence soil drainage problems. These problems are observed mainly in Pelotas and its surroundings, and depending on the time of year, may produce flooding issues that hamper both the development and productivity of cultures. In situations in which soil is flooded, oxygen levels are insufficient for root growth, can hinder cellular respiration and may lead to a cellular energy crisis. In addition, global climate change is affecting the climate, and such changes are expected to increase the frequency and severity of flood events in many the agricultural regions. In order to design studies that aim to enhance the selection of flood tolerant genotypes, it is essential to understand the physiological and molecular changes that occur in plants under conditions of oxygen deprivation. Since the production of peach trees in the region is accomplished using rootstocks, the aim of this study was to evaluate gas exchange parameters and gene expression changes involved in glycolytic, fermentative and ethylene metabolism in the peach cultivar NR0170401 and plum cultivars Marianna 2624 and Myrobalan 29C under flooded soil conditions. To this end, gas exchange parameters [net photosynthetic rate (A), and stomata] conductance (gs)] and the expression of nine genes [ACO1 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase), ACS5 (1-aminoacyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid synthase), ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1), G6P (glucose-6-phosphate plastidic transporter), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), LDH1 (lactate dehydrogenase 1), PDC (Pyruvate decarboxylase), SAMs (SAM synthase), and UDPg (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase] were evaluated under conditions of flooding relative to controls. An evaluation of gas exchange showed that the plum cultivars are more tolerant to flooding than the peach cultivar studied. RT-qPCR results showed that the three evaluated rootstocks activated fermentative metabolism in roots in the first six hours post-flooding period, and root tissues were more highly affected than leaves. 'Marianna 2426' appears to have a more efficient gene response system compared to the other cultivars studied under conditions of oxygen deprivation. Although more studies are needed, such information has the potential to facilitate the selection of rootstocks used for peach production, for orchard management and for plant breeding programs aiming to produce new cultivars with increased flood tolerance.

Limiting the potential damage of HMPs by taking preventive or remedial actions requires the probabilistic expectation of where and how frequently these processes may occur. The information on where and how frequently a given earth surface process may manifest can be expressed via susceptibility modeling. For the whole Chinese territory, a susceptibility model for HMP is currently not available. To address this issue, we propose a yearly space-time model built on the basis of a binomial Generalized Linear Model. The target variable of such model is the annual presences/absences of HMP per catchment across China, from 1985 to 2015. This information has been accessed via the Chinese catalogue of HMP, a data repository the Chinese Government has activated in 1950 and which is still currently in use. This binary spatio-temporal information is regressed against a set of time-invariant (catchment shape indices and geomorphic attributes) and time-variant (urban coverage, rainfall, vegetation density and land use) covariates. Furthermore, we include a regression constant for each of the 31 years under consideration and also a three-years aggregated information on previously occurred (and not occurred) HMP. We consider two versions of our modeling approach, an explanatory benchmark where we fit the whole space-time HMP data, including a multiple intercept per year. Furthermore, we also extend this explanatory model into a predictive one, by considering four temporal cross-validation schemes. As a result, we portrayed the annual susceptibility models into 30 maps, where the south-east of China is shown to exhibit the largest variation in the spatio-temporal probability of HMP occurrence. Also, we compressed the whole spatiotemporal prediction into three summary maps. These report the mean, maximum and 95% confidence interval of the spatio-temporal susceptibility distribution per catchment, per year. The information we present has a dual value. On the one hand, we provide a platform to interpret environmental effects controlling the occurrence of HMP over a very large spatial (the whole Chinese country) and temporal (31 years of records) domain. On the other hand, we provide information on which catchments are more prone to experience a HMP-driven hazard. Hence, a step further would be to select the most susceptible catchments for detailed analysis where physically based models could be tested to estimate the potentially impacted areas. For transparency, the results generated in this work are shared in the supplementary material as GIS (geopackage) files.

Natural archives of paleo-typhoon variability can be used to assess how changes in the planetary climatic system during the Holocene could influence TC frequency and intensity in this part of Pacific. Extreme typhoon-related rains are the main cause of catastrophic floods on Sakhalin Island and deposits of these floods are evidence of paleo-typhoon. The paleo-typhoons that triggered extreme floods on Southern Sakhalin during the last 6.6 kyr are recorded in the sequence on the interfluvial surface in the northern Susunay Lowland (Naiba River basin). The sequence includes peat bog with numerous loam interlayers deposited during extreme floods inundating the bog. We reconstructed paleo-environmental conditions, including humidity and flood activity, based on analysis of diatoms. We found biological indicators that point to the past floods. The mineral content in the peat being one criteria indicative of the high frequency of floods. The peat bog developed in place of a lagoon that existed at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression. Peat accumulation began in the freshened lagoon coast similar to 6010 cal yr B.P. When sea level dropped, the lagoon turned into a coastal lake (similar to 5710-5040 cal yr B.P.). A swamp formed in place of the lake under varying moisture conditions. We identified and dated 25 extreme floods and assessed the paleoclimatic background of the events. A recent catastrophic flood from typhoon Phyllis (1981 CE) is considered as an analogue of the paleo-events. The frequency of extreme typhoons increased both during warm (wet and dry) phases and in cold dry phases of the climate fluctuations. We identified three periods of a high typhoon activity (4640-4360; 4030-3580; 1860-1380 cal yr B.P.), when super-typhoons came onto the island once every 30-90 years. A comparison between the extreme typhoons in the south of Sakhalin and in the Sea of Japan region show both synchronism and metachronism of the periods of typhoon activity. Instrumental measurements during 20th-21st centuries revealed considerable changes in super-typhoon tracks; a similar variability may be safely supposed in typhoon tracks in the past. To predict future tropical cyclone activity and the risk of floods under modern climatic instability it is necessary to understand factors influencing variability in the occurrence of strong typhoons and associated extreme floods events on a paleo-scale. This is especially important for areas with rapidly developing coastal economies and intensive use of gas and oil resources, such as Sakhalin Island.

However, little is known about the mechanism of C stabilization in Mollisols, especially subjected to different management effects. To trace C stabilization between aggregates and SOM density fractions in Mollisols, soil samples were collected from different experimental plots: controlled irrigation + rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw removal (CI), flooded irrigation + rice straw removal (FI), controlled irrigation + rice straw return (CI-SR), and flooded irrigation + rice straw return (FI-SR). Each soil sample was separated into three aggregate size classes (> 250 pm, 53-250 pm, and < 53 pm), then each class individually subjected to density fractionation to obtain free and occluded light fractions (fLF and oLF), as well as dense and mineral-heavy fractions (DF and MF). The overall C content and 13C abundance of fractions were measured to interpret C transfer and accumulation among aggregate and density fractions. The highest increase in the soil organic C (9.27-24.88%) was observed in CI-SR compared with the other treatments. Irrigation and straw return primarily affected C accumulation within macroaggregates and the MF, which were the dominant forms in the aggregates and density fractions, respectively. An enrichment in delta C-13 was found from macroaggregates to silt + clay, and from light to heavy fractions, indicating that Mollisols macroaggregates and light fractions acted as the source or initial store of plant residues, and that the C in the silt + clay class and heaviest fraction contained more microbially-transformed C than did the macroaggregates and light fractions. A detailed scheme of C transfer within aggregates and SOM fractions based on the delta C-13 natural abundance revealed the following general sequence: free light -> occluded light -> dense -> mineral fractions, concurring with results reported at upland sites. There is a greater probability of C transfer between SOM density fractions under CI. This contrasted with the results that CI decreases the possibility of C exchange between aggregates than FI, which indicates differences in the C stabilization processes between no-flooded and flooded conditions of Mollisols. In addition, straw returning can reduce the possibility of C exchange both between and within aggregates, which plays a significant role in maintaining the stability of the Mollisols carbon cycle. The present study provides further detailed insights into the C stabilizing mechanisms in Mollisols which depend on management (straw, water status). This finding is conducive to the sustainable use and management of Mollisols toward maintaining or increasing C stock and in realizing the objective of C-neutral agriculture.

The West Seti River Basin (WSRB), a prominent Himalayan Basin of Nepal, is a major source of fresh water in the western region of the country. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for hydrological modelling and identified the most sensitive hydrological parameters, while the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique was employed for model calibration. The model was calibrated for the study period (1999-2005) with a three-year warm-up period (1996-1998). Subsequently, it was validated for three years (2006-2008). The results show that the large number of Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) for model simulation took a considerable time, without improving the performance statistics. Importantly, significant improvements were observed during both calibration and validation periods when elevation bands (EBs) were taken into consideration. The p-factor, r-factor, coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), Root mean square error (RMSE)-observations, and standard deviation (STDEV) ratio (RSR) were used to measure the performance between observed and simulated values. The values of p-factor, r-factor, R-2, NSE, PBIAS, and RSR during the calibration were 0.82, 0.80, 0.84, 0.82, 7.2, and 0.42, respectively, whereas during validation they were 0.79, 0.72, 0.83, 0.82, 11.8, and 0.42, respectively. The calibrated model was then used to assess the anticipated river discharge. This study used four regional climate models (RCMs) for precipitation and six for temperature, together with their arithmetical average as multi-model ensembles (MMES) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We analysed the changes in precipitation, temperature, and river discharge for three future time frames: Futurel (F1: 2020-2044), Future2 (F2: 2045-2069), and Future3 (F3: 2075-2099) with respect to the baseline (1996-2005). The magnitude of changes varied according to the different climate models and warming scenarios. In general, the MMEs showed slightly increasing precipitation (higher during the F2 period), significantly increasing temperature (continuous rising trend), and moderately increasing river discharge (higher during the F2 period). Information such as the anticipated shift in the flow duration curve may be helpful to stakeholders across different water sectors for effective water resource management in the future. From the modelling perspective, the results show greater significance for EBs than HRUs during the modelling of high mountain basins with SWAT. This take-home message would be useful to hydrologists and other stakeholders in evaluating different scenarios over a short duration, without iteratively spending higher computational time.

Quaternary evolution of the Plounice River system (Bohemian Massif) based on fluvial deposits dated with optically stimulated luminescence and in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Cosmogenic nuclides; Optically stimulated luminescence; Fluvial terraces; Bohemian Massif; Pleistocene; Neotectonics	AMS-FACILITY DREAMS; ELBE FAULT SYSTEM; HALF-LIFE; BE-10; SOUTH; RATES; INCISION; RADIONUCLIDES; SEPARATION; TERRACES	The Plounice River system, located in the central Bohemian Massif, is draining an area almost not covered by continental ice sheets but instead archiving the fluvial deposits. The fluvial style changes from a high-energy braided to a long-bend meandering river in the upper terrace levels (36 to 29 m above present floodplain). The middle terrace levels (22 to 14 m above present floodplain) indicate a fluvial style changing from a high- to medium-energy braided river. In the lower terrace levels (13 to 5 m above present floodplain), the terrace deposits indicate high-energy braided to long-bend meandering river environments. To provide greater details on the timing of fluvial terrace formation, this study applied (26)A1 and Be-10 isochron burial and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods to terraces of the Plounice River system. Terrace fluvial infills are dated with isochron burial dating in relative altitude 34, 29, and 14 m above present floodplain (apf); whereas terrace accumulations in relative altitude 19, 12, and 6 m apf are dated with OSL. Because of differences in age results between the two dating methods, we propose two different evolution models: the first is based on isochron burial and OSL dating, and the second model is on OSL dating results only. The time span represented by the river terraces remains unclear and varies from Eburonian to Weichselian (1680 to 56 ka) or from Saalian to Weichselian (138 to 56 ka) with the estimation of the highest terrace (248 ka) respectively. The former river evolution model is based on tectonic activity at least since 1000 ka. Morphotectonic analysis recognized new lineaments of which the general direction corresponds with the main direction of the Ohre fault zone (NE- to ENE-striking) and Lace fault zone (NW-striking). Based on dated terrace ages of 1153 +/- 123 ka at 14 m apf and 138 +/- 21 ka at 19 m above present floodplain, we propose a normal fault being active from at least 1153 ka. The second river evolution model assumes possible remobilization of clasts analyzed by isochron burial dating before their final deposition. From three OSL ages we calculated a mean incision rate and estimated an age of upper terrace levels at 34 m apf to be 248 +/- 38 ka (Saalian age). As remobilization of clasts in high-energy fluvial and glaciofluvial environments is very likely, age determination is challenging. Nevertheless, we interpret the terrace record in the Ploucnice River system as a product of Quaternary climatic changes influenced by tectonic processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With rainfall from TCs set to increase under anthropogenic climate change, it is critical to accurately estimate extreme rainfall to better support short-term and long-term resilience efforts. While high-resolution climate models capture TC statistics better than low-resolution models, they are computationally expensive. This leads to a trade-off between capturing TC features accurately, and generating large enough simulation data sets to sufficiently sample high-impact, low-probability events. Downscaling can assist by predicting high-resolution features from relatively cheap, low-resolution models. Here, we develop and evaluate a set of three deep learning models for downscaling TC rainfall to hazard-relevant spatial scales. We use rainfall from the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation observational product at a coarsened resolution of similar to 100 km, and apply our downscaling model to reproduce the original resolution of similar to 10 km. We find that the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network is able to capture realistic spatial structures and power spectra and performs the best overall, with mean biases within 5% of observations. We also show that the model can perform well at extrapolating to the most extreme storms, which were not used in training. Plain Language Summary Tropical cyclones (TCs) are often associated with intense winds, but it is actually their associated rainfall and flooding that cause the majority of mortality and damages. A warmer atmosphere is able to hold more water vapor and therefore we expect to see increases in rainfall from TCs with global warming. To better support resilience efforts, it is critical to model current and future TC rainfall, but climate models at standard resolution struggle to do this accurately. Running climate models at very high resolution produces better results, though this requires significant computational resources meaning that fewer high-impact, low-probability TCs can be generated. Other methods, called downscaling models, are used to provide a computationally cheaper alternative by generating high-resolution TC-specific data rather than an entire global climate data set. In this study, we develop a set of deep learning models which can generate high-resolution rainfall data from low-resolution rainfall data. To do this, we train our models on data from observational data sets that have data for the period 1979-2020. We find that the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network performs the best over the metrics studied and is able to reproduce the most extreme storms that were not used in training.

Earthquake, floods and changing land use history: A 200-year overview of environmental changes in Selenga River basin as indicated by n-alkanes and related proxies in sediments from shallow lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sedimentary organic matter; Molecular biomarkers; Isoprenoids; Selenga River basin; Environmental changes	ORGANIC-MATTER SOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES; ECOLOGICAL CHANGES; LIPID BIOMARKERS; SURFACE-WATER; BAIKAL; DELTA; TERRESTRIAL	The Selenga River basin, located in southern Siberia, is an important component of the Lake Baikal ecosystem, and comprises approximately 80 % of the Baikal watershed. Within the Selenga River basin, two localized study regions were chosen. The first, the Selenga Delta, is one of the largest inland freshwater floodplains in the world and plays an important role in the ecosystem functioning of Baikal. It purifies the river waters before they enter the lake and acts as a refuge for many of Baikal's endemic species. The second location, the Gusinoozersk region, is southwest of Lake Baikal and the Selenga Delta, and was chosen as a more heavily industrialized region within the Selenga River basin. Anthropogenic activities, including industry, urban settlements, aquaculture and agriculture, have historically increased ecological damage within this area. We assessed possible drivers of changes in sedimentary organic matter (OM) composition within two shallow lakes (SLNG04 and Black Lake), located in the Selenga Delta and the Selenga watershed, respectively. We focused on individual n-alkanes, one of the most abundant and common lipids used to pro-vide information on past vegetation and used multivariate statistics to disentangle changes in the sources of sedimen-tary OM over time. The depositional OM history of SLNG04B core can be divided in four zones: (i) major influence of non-emergent vascular plants, typically found in transitional environments (ca. 1835 to ca. 1875); (ii) increased influ-ence of grasses/herbs (ca. 1880 to ca. 1910); (iii) transition from non-emergent vascular plants and grasses/herbs to submerged and floating macrophytes and phytoplankton (ca. 1915 to ca. 1945); (iv) maintenance of autochthonous OM from submerged and floating macrophytes and phytoplankton (ca. 1945 to ca. 2014). The depositional OM history of the Black Lake core can be divided in two main zones: (i) major influence of non-emergent vascular plants and sub-merged and floating macrophytes (ca. 1915 to ca. 1980); (ii) increased influence of grasses/herbs and phytoplankton (ca. 1980 to ca. 2010). Natural events (e.g., an earthquake in 1862 caused flooding and subsidence of much of the land surrounding SLNG04 lake and a further catastrophic flood event in 1897) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., nutrient pollution from expansion of agricultural and livestock population) changed the composition of sedimentary OM result-ing in ecological shifts across trophic levels in the Selenga River basin.

J	Wang, JH; Liu, PLF				Wang, Jinghua; Liu, Philip L-F			Numerical study on impacts of a concurrent storm-tide-tsunami event in Macau and Hong Kong	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Storm surge; Tsunamis; Fully coupled model; Coastal flooding	SOUTH CHINA SEA; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; TYPHOON HATO; MODEL	Intensified activities of tropical cyclones in the Western North Pacific have imposed increasing threats to coastal cities in the context of global climate change. A storm surge superimposed with astronomical high tide, i.e., a storm-tide event, often causes severe flooding in many coastal cities in South China Sea (SCS) region. Meanwhile, the potential tsunami hazard associated with the megathrust in Manila subduction zone has become a serious concern in this region. These two kinds of coastal hazard have been studied independently in the past since they are caused by different physical mechanisms in nature. However, there is no scientific reason to rule out the possibility of concurrence of a storm-tide-tsunami event, which is admittedly rare. This study simulates a group of synthetic events assuming that tsunami waves are generated by a Mw 9 earthquake in the Manila subduction zone during a typhoon, which has the same characteristics as the 2017 Typhoon Hato. A numerical model package originally developed for storm-tide calculation has been modified to simulate a concurrent storm-tidetsunami event. A variety of scenarios are considered as the tsunamis are superimposed at different phases of the storm-tide event. Their compound impacts on Macau and Hong Kong in Pearl River Delta, China, are investigated. Specifically, the results of water level, arrival time of the maximum water level, flow velocity, and inundation depth are discussed. The worst-case scenarios have been identified at Macau and Hong Kong, respectively. The scenario with tsunami being initiated at 07:00 on 23-Aug-2017 leads to an inundated area of 12.0 km2 in Macau. On the other hand, the scenario with tsunami being started at 08:10 on the same day generates an inundation area of 8.9 km2 in the vicinity of Kai Tak terminal region in Hong Kong. In addition, the efficacy of the linear superposition of results obtained separately for each hazard (i.e., typhoon and tsunamis) is also discussed. Generally speaking, the differences between the linearly superimposed solutions and fully coupled results vary temporally and spatially and could be either positive or negative. However, the linearly superimposed solutions consistently underestimate the maximum water elevation and yield delays on the arrival times of peak flooding stage in the Pearl River estuary. It is concluded that for coastal protection and hazard mitigation planning in this region, these extreme situations need to be considered. A fully coupled numerical model package is now available for conducting such studies.

The multiproxy analysis offers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of this coastal landscape in relation to past sea level and climate changes in the southern high latitudes. After ca. 19,000 cal yr BP, the sediments were subjected to subaerial exposure and oxidation linked to a low sea level. The Sr/Ba ratio (a paleosalinity geochemical parameter) indicates variations in the water body level, and diatoms imply the existence of an ephemeral and brackish-freshwater body subject to desiccation under arid conditions. Between ca. 11,600 and 8500 cal yr BP, a shrubby steppe vegetation, mainly composed of Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae, spread over the coastal area associated with a shallow freshwater body and the deposition of fine-grained sediments in low-energy environments, all indicative of low effective moisture and warm climate conditions. Between ca. 8500 and 8100 cal yr BP, salt carpet vegetation, dominated by Chenopodiaceae, developed around a coastal lagoon in response to the Holocene marine transgression. The record of dinocysts and geochemical data indicate marine influence at this time. Between ca. 8100 and 7000 cal yr BP, salt marshes colonized the coastal area. A coastal lagoon with a more restricted connection to the sea and minor freshwater input are inferred, linked to the beginning of a regressive phase. After ca. 7000 cal yr BP, grassland vegetation and an open shrub stratum developed along with a shallow lake (pan) that was disconnected from the sea, following a fall in the sea level and regression. Fluctuations in the water level of the pan and changes in the physical-chemical conditions, as indicated by fluctuations in Mn/Fe, Ti/Ca, Rb/Sr, Ca, TIC and TOC, suggest abrupt events of desiccation and flooding. Between ca. 4500 and 2000 cal yr BP a drier phase is indicated by changes in vegetation, algal content and geochemistry of the pan. A grassland vegetation and a shallow lake with seasonal water level variations characterized the last 2000 years. Our results from LLV area match well with Andean forest fluctuations and regional climatic conditions recorded from Tierra del Fuego and Chilean southwest.

Moreover, they can help to understand both how climate change and how land use and land cover changes impact the sediment exchange between the Amazon River and floodplain lakes in this important and complex ecosystem. This study investigates the suitability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 spectral characteristics in retrieving total (TSS) and inorganic (TSI) suspended sediments on a set of Amazon floodplain lakes in the middle-lower Amazon basin using in situ Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs) measurements to simulate Landsat 8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Sentinel 2/MSI (Multispectral Instrument) bands and to calibrate/validate several TSS and TSI empirical algorithms. The calibration was based on the Monte Carlo Simulation carried out for the following datasets: (1) All-Dataset, consisting of all the data acquired during four field campaigns at five lakes spread over the lower Amazon floodplain (n = 94); (2) Campaign-Dataset including samples acquired in a specific hydrograph phase (season) in all lakes. As sample size varied from one season to the other, n varied from 18 to 31; (3) Lake-Dataset including samples acquired in all seasons at a given lake with n also varying from 17 to 67 for each lake. The calibrated models were, then, applied to OLI and MSI scenes acquired in August 2017. The performance of three atmospheric correction algorithms was also assessed for both OLI (6S, ACOLITE, and L8SR) and MSI (6S, ACOLITE, and Sen2Cor) images. The impact of glint correction on atmosphere-corrected image performance was assessed against in situ glint-corrected R-rs measurements. After glint correction, the L8SR and 6S atmospheric correction performed better with the OLI and MSI sensors, respectively (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 16.68% and 14.38%) considering the entire set of bands. However, for a given single band, different methods have different performances. The validated TSI and TSS satellite estimates showed that both in situ TSI and TSS algorithms provided reliable estimates, having the best results for the green OLI band (561 nm) and MSI red-edge band (705 nm) (MAPE < 21%). Moreover, the findings indicate that the OLI and MSI models provided similar errors, which support the use of both sensors as a virtual constellation for the TSS and TSI estimate over an Amazon floodplain. These results demonstrate the applicability of the calibration/validation techniques developed for the empirical modeling of suspended sediments in lower Amazon floodplain lakes using medium-resolution sensors.

Aram Dorsum: An Extensive Mid-Noachian Age Fluvial Depositional System in Arabia Terra, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							LARGE ALLUVIAL FANS; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; AEOLIS DORSA; GALE CRATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STRATIGRAPHY; HISTORY; SURFACE; BASIN; RIVER	A major debate in Mars science is the nature of the early Mars climate, and the availability of precipitation and runoff. Observations of relict erosional valley networks have been proposed as evidence for extensive surface runoff around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. However, these valley networks only provide a time-integrated record of landscape evolution, and thus, the timing, relative timescales and intensity of aqueous activity required to erode the valleys remain unknown. Here, we investigate an ancient fluvial sedimentary system in western Arabia Terra, now preserved in positive relief. This ridge, "Aram Dorsum," is flat-topped, branching, similar to 85 km long, and particularly well preserved. We show that Aram Dorsum was an aggradational alluvial system and that the existing ridge was once a large river channel belt set in extensive flood plains, many of which are still preserved. Smaller, palaeochannel belts feed the main system; their setting and network pattern suggest a distributed source of water. The alluvial succession is up to 60 m thick, suggesting a formation time of 10(5) to 10(7) years by analogy to Earth. Our observations are consistent with Aram Dorsum having formed by long-lived flows of water, sourced both locally, and regionally as part of a wider alluvial system in Arabia Terra. This suggests frequent or seasonal precipitation as the source of water. Correlating our observations with previous regional-scale mapping shows that Aram Dorsum formed in the mid-Noachian. Aram Dorsum is one of the oldest fluvial systems described on Mars and indicates climatic conditions that sustained surface river flows on early Mars. Plain Language Summary The oldest regions of Mars contain ancient valleys, carved by running water, and sinuous ridges, often interpreted as the remnants of former riverbeds, left upstanding by erosion. These "inverted channel" systems provide insight into Mars's ancient climate and hydrologic cycle. We use high-resolution satellite images to investigate "Aram Dorsum," an 85 km long ridge system in the Arabia Terra region. Our observations show that Aram Dorsum is composed of sedimentary rocks, originally deposited in rivers or their adjacent floodplains. The Aram Dorsum sedimentary material is up to 60mthick, which, by comparison with similar sedimentary deposits on Earth, suggests that the Aram Dorsum river system was active for between 10,000 and 10 million years. Our study also indicates that Aram Dorsum was formed around 3.9 billion years ago, an age consistent with other evidence for ancient rivers and lakes in this region. The water that flowed within the rivers at Aram Dorsum probably came from both locally and regionally generated rainfall or snowfall, rather than a single point source of water, such as large distant ice sheets. Our observations therefore point to an ancient Martian climate that supported precipitation and river flow for thousands or millions of years.

J	Pellegrini, G; Mao, LC; Rainato, R; Picco, L				Pellegrini, Giacomo; Mao, Luca; Rainato, Riccardo; Picco, Lorenzo			Surprising suspended sediment dynamics of an alpine basin affected by a large infrequent disturbance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Vaia rainstorm; Suspended sediment; Cascading processes; Mountain basin resilience	MOUNTAINOUS CATCHMENTS; BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; SOIL-MOISTURE; RIO CORDON; DISCHARGE; RIVER; LOAD; YIELD; HYSTERESIS; STREAMS	In many environments, climate change causes an increase in the frequency and magnitude of Large Infrequent Disturbances (LIDs). LIDs make fragile areas, as mountain basins, even more vulnerable, along with local communities that could be severely affected by extreme events. Among all LIDs, windthrows are one of the most relevant and yet rather unpredictable disturbances affecting the Alpine region. Windthrows can affect the forest cover and morphological settings at the basin scale, changing the supply of sediments to river networks and affecting the sediment cascading processes. This work aims at (i) identifying the contribution of Suspended Sediment Load (SSL) from a windthrow-managed-affected area induced in an Alpine basin by a recent LID (Vaia rainstorm, 2018), (ii) assessing the annual, seasonal and monthly variation in the SSL, and (iii) analysing the changes in SSL fluxes and dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd year after the LID in comparison to those detected after a similar high magnitude event occurred in 1994. To do so, two multiparameter sondes measuring the water level and the turbidity were installed upstream and downstream the windthrow-affected area. Discharge measurements and water samples were collected to obtain the rating curves and calibrate the turbidity meters in order to derive suspended sediment loads (SSL). The results show that the windthrow-affected area was significantly contributing suspended sediment during events occurring two years after Vaia (2020) but less intensively in those occurred three years after the event itself (2021). Both the events average intensity rainfalls and the total precipitation appear to be the best predictors of both the peak of suspended sediment concentration (SSCp), the total suspended sediment (SSL) and the suspended sediment percentage variation among the two cross-sections. The seasonal and monthly analysis revealed to be in line with those detected prior the disturbance. The analyzed LID affected the transport efficiency for near-bankfull events but not the annual sediment yield as it was found after the previous high magnitude flood event recorded in 1994. Unexpectedly, the mean rate of SSL (42 t km(-2) yr(-1)) is indeed comparable with what monitored during the decade before Vaia (2004-2014) (40 t km(-2) yr(-1)). Such surprising results may be explained by the fact that the Rio Cordon basin have had an alluvial response rather than colluvial during the Vaia rainstorm event and that the basin's resilience may be in a different stage as compared to the one of 1994, when the catchment featured different cascading processes that completely overturn the suspended sediment dynamics and fluxes for about a decade.

Understanding their interrelated impacts has important implications for develop-ment policy, for market access, credit provision, and forest conservation. Using a survey of 2,417 house-holds in 64 villages in four Provinces in Cambodia and satellite data on forest extent, we test hypotheses and quantify the relative contributions and first-order interactions effects of market and road access, for -est access, and formal and informal financial credit access on household expenditures and livelihood incomes. We test hypotheses about their statistical interactions, their relative contributions to incomes, and how their effects differ within and outside the Mekong River floodplain. Market and road access are significant with gross income and expenditures, as well as portfolio shifts to off-farm business activities. Forest access contributes significantly to gross income and expenditures. Credit utilization is significant with gross income, expenditures, off-farm business, and livestock activities. Households below the pov-erty line use financial credit primarily for consumption and agricultural investments, but above the pov-erty line for business investment and purchasing assets. Market access and financial credit are more important for incomes in the Mekong floodplain area, while forest access is more important outside it. Using dominance analysis, we find that financial credit contributes more than market or forest access to gross income, expenditures, and livestock income. However, market access is more important than credit for off-farm, on-farm and crop incomes, and forest access contributes more to gross income than formal credit access. We also test for first-order interactions between these effects and find they are sta-tistically significant, confirming a synergistic interaction between credit, market and forest access. Market access improves the impact of credit use, as credit use improves gross and off-farm incomes with improved access to large cities, and improves livestock incomes with improved road access. Forests and roads act synergistically to improve household incomes in areas with good city market access, as forest access contributes more to gross income, expenditures and off-farm incomes in areas with good primary road access, and to on-farm incomes in areas with good secondary road access. Our findings show that market, road, credit and forest effects are interconnected and interdependent, but support each other, and significant interaction effects between forest and market access suggest that policies for poverty reduction and forest conservation should be coordinated with the development of roads to improve potential forest returns.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhao, WP; Abhishek; Kinouchi, T				Zhao, Wenpeng; Abhishek; Kinouchi, Tsuyoshi			Uncertainty quantification in intensity-duration-frequency curves under climate change: Implications for flood-prone tropical cities	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Uncertainty; IDF curves; Bias correction; Data-scarcity; Scaling property; Global warming	BIAS CORRECTION; IDF CURVES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; RAINFALL; DISAGGREGATION; MODEL; URBANIZATION; SIMULATIONS; IMPACT; SITES	Updating the existing intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves (focusing on 1-24 h) to reduce the global warming risks are typically based on regional climate models (RCMs). However, uncertainties are known to be present in such updating and need quantifying, especially whether bias correction (BC) methods should be used or not is less understood. Furthermore, the updating is still challenging for flood-prone cities in Southeast Asia due to a lack of sub-daily gauge-based observations. Therefore, in this study, firstly, we investigate the uncertainties related to the use of the BC, and the choices of different RCMs, RCP scenarios, parameter estimation methods by using the 'analysis of variance' method. Secondly, we propose a framework for developing and updating IDF curves in the data-scarce city (with only daily gauge observations) in Cambodia (Phnom Penh City (PPC)) by utilizing the rainfall information from the nearby cities (Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Can Tho City (CTC) in Vietnam), based on the scaling property of rainfall duration versus intensity. A comparison between the RCMs with and without BC reveals that BC can efficiently remove the model bias, and the changes of rainfall intensity with BC are consistent with the underlying physical mechanisms (i.e., where atmospheric circulation tends to drive a larger increase in rarer rainfall events than less rare ones), supporting the application of BC before developing IDF curves. Further quantification of different uncertainty sources reveals that RCMs account for the largest share of the total variance (41.0% and 47.9% in HCMC and CTC, respectively). It is followed by the BC, with 39.4% and 29.7% in the two cities, respectively. RCP scenarios and parameter estimation methods provide the comparable and lowest uncertainty. The projected IDF curves in PPC, developed based on the integrated rainfall information (i.e., daily rainfall in PPC and scaling properties in nearby cities), reveal an apparent upshift (e.g., 33.6-43.7% increase in 20-year rainfall intensity in the near future (2026-2045) under RCP 4.5) of the IDF curves compared with the curves in the historical period (1986-2005). However, the deep uncertainty in such projection requires us to adopt a dynamic adaption strategy that can be iteratively updated based on new information. The current framework on quantifying different uncertainty sources and updating the IDF curves for data-scarce cities can provide suggestions for similar studies in other regions globally.

Correspondingly, major disasters in the YRB are characterized by varied types, extensive distributions, and sudden occurrences. In addition, major disasters in the YRB usually evolve into disaster chains that cause severe consequences. Therefore, major disasters in the YRB destroy ecologies and environments and influence geological and ecological safety in the basin. This paper systematically reviews research on geological and surface processes, major disaster effects, and risk mitigation in the YRB, discusses the trends and challenges of relevant research, analyzes the key scientific problems that need to be solved, and suggests prospects for future research based on the earth system science concept. Themes of research that should be focused on include geological, surface and climatic processes in the YRB and their interlinking disaster gestation mechanisms; formation mechanisms and disaster chain evolutions of giant landslides in the upper reach of the YRB; mechanisms and disaster chain effects of loess water-soil disasters in the middle reach of the YRB; occurrence patterns and amplifying effects of giant flood chains in the lower reach of the YRB; and risk mitigations of major disasters in the YRB. Key scientific problems that need to be solved are as follows: how to reveal the geological, surface and climatic processes that are coupled and interlinked with gestation mechanisms of major disasters; how to clarify the mutual feedback effects between major disasters and ecology; and how to develop a human-environmental harmony-based integrated risk mitigation system for major disasters. Prospects for future studies that follow the earth system science concept include the following: highlighting interdisciplinary research to reveal the interlinked disaster gestation mechanisms of the geology, surface and climate in the YRB in the past, present, and future; forming theories to clarify the regional patterns, dynamic mechanisms, and mutual-feedback effects between disaster chains and ecology in the YRB on land and in rivers in the region; solving technological bottlenecks to develop assessment models and mitigation theories for integrated risks in the YRB by following the human-environment harmony concept; and finally, establishing a demonstratable application pattern characterized by "whole-basin coverage" and "zonal controls", thereby guaranteeing ecological and geological safety in the basin and providing scientific support for ecological conservation and high-quality development of the YRB.

The main objective of this research work is to identify and address the role of input data quality and hydrological parameter sets, and uncertainty propagation in hydrological extremes estimation. This includes identifying and estimating their contribution to flood and low flow magnitude using two objective functions (NSE for flood and LogNSE for low flow), 20,000 Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) hydrological parameter sets, and three frequency distribution models (Log-Normal, Pearson-III, and Generalized Extreme Value). The influence of uncertainty on the simulated flow is not uniform across all the selected three catchments due to different flow regimes and runoff generation mechanisms. The result shows that the uncertainty in high flow frequency modeling mainly comes from the input data quality. In the modeling of low flow frequency, the main contributor to the total uncertainty is model parameterization. The total uncertainty of QT90 (extreme peak flow quantile at 90-year return period) quantile shows that the interaction of input data and hydrological parameter sets have a significant role in the total uncertainty. In contrast, in the QT10 (extreme low flow quantile at 10-year return period) estimation, the input data quality and hydrological parameters significantly impact the total uncertainty. This implies that the primary factors and their interactions may cause considerable risk in water resources management and flood and drought risk management. Therefore, neglecting these factors and their interaction in disaster risk management, water resource planning, and evaluation of environmental impact assessment is not feasible and may lead to considerable risk. Recommendations for Water Resource Managers The role of hydrological parameters and climate input data is significant in flood and low flow estimations and significantly impacts water resources and extremes management. Input data dominantly controlled flood magnitude and frequency, whilst the low flow magnitude and frequency were dominantly affected by both input data quality and hydrological parameters. It is crucial to consider the main features that cause considerable risk in water resource management and extreme risk management. Neglecting the primary factors and their interaction in disaster risk management, water resource planning, and evaluation of environmental impact assessment is not feasible and may lead to considerable risk. Improved extreme water management through a complex modeling approach to better prepare for the impact of extreme high and low flow changes are the best long- and short-term plans and strategies to combat and minimize the risk in water-related sectors of the local economy.

J	Fereidoon, M; Koch, M; Brocca, L				Fereidoon, Majid; Koch, Manfred; Brocca, Luca			Predicting Rainfall and Runoff Through Satellite Soil Moisture Data and SWAT Modelling for a Poorly Gauged Basin in Iran	WATER			English	Article						AMSR-E soil moisture product; SM2RAIN; SWAT hydrological model; Karkheh river basin; Iran	WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL; KARKHEH RIVER-BASIN; STREAMFLOW SIMULATIONS; PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL; ASCAT; CALIBRATION; PARAMETERS	Hydrological models are widely used for many purposes in water sector projects, including streamflow prediction and flood risk assessment. Among the input data used in such hydrological models, the spatial-temporal variability of rainfall datasets has a significant role on the final discharge estimation. Therefore, accurate measurements of rainfall are vital. On the other hand, ground-based measurement networks, mainly in developing countries, are either nonexistent or too sparse to capture rainfall accurately. In addition to in-situ rainfall datasets, satellite-derived rainfall products are currently available globally with high spatial and temporal resolution. An innovative approach called SM2RAIN that estimates rainfall from soil moisture data has been applied successfully to various regions. In this study, first, soil moisture content derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) is used as input into the SM2RAIN algorithm to estimate daily rainfall (SM2R-AMSRE) at different sites in the Karkheh river basin (KRB), southwest Iran. Second, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model was applied to simulate runoff using both ground-based observed rainfall and SM2R-AMSRE rainfall as input. The results reveal that the SM2R-AMSRE rainfall data are, in most cases, in good agreement with ground-based rainfall, with correlations R ranging between 0.58 and 0.88, though there is some underestimation of the observed rainfall due to soil moisture saturation not accounted for in the SM2RAIN equation. The subsequent SWAT-simulated monthly runoff from SM2R-AMSRE rainfall data (SWAT-SM2R-AMSRE) reproduces the observations at the six gauging stations (with coefficient of determination, R-2 > 0.71 and NSE > 0.56), though with slightly worse performances in terms of bias (Bias) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) and, again, some systematic flow underestimation compared to the SWAT model with ground-based rainfall input. Additionally, rainfall estimates of two satellite products of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), 3B42 and 3B42RT, are used in the calibrated SWAT- model after bias correction. The monthly runoff predictions obtained with 3B42- rainfall have 0.42 < R-2 < 0.72 and-0.06 < NSE < 0.74 which are slightly better than those obtained with 3B42RT- rainfall, but not as good as the SWAT-SM2R-AMSRE. Therefore, despite the aforementioned limitations, using SM2R-AMSRE rainfall data in a hydrological model like SWAT appears to be a viable approach in basins with limited ground-based rainfall data.

Cacao is also an important crop due to its potential to replace illicit crops and it is related to less deforestation and preserves the biodiversity. There are several cacao districts in Colombia, one of these being Arauca. The Department of Arauca is the second largest cocoa producing region in Colombia; however, it is heavily affected by armed conflict. To raise the knowledge and technology available in the region, integrating data on the occurrence of cacao farms with climatic variables becomes powerful socioeconomic mapping tool for maintaining agrobiodiversity and food security the region. Consequently, this type of agrodiversity data and agroclimatic approaches help to better manage agrobiodiversity, as in the cacao region of Arauca. These tools are even more relevant in biodiverse regions, such as flooded savannahs and tropical forest ecosystems, which are currently undergoing drastic changes due to agricultural expansion and climate change. One of the knowledge gaps in Colombia ' s cacao regions is that there are currently no agroclimatic maps made with a social and scientific approach. This study aimed to provide a database of the spatial distribution of cacao farms in Arauca, as well as agroclimatic maps that identify and locate cacao climate regions in Arauca. We also present a presence-only matrix consisting of twenty-six tree species, or agrobiodiversity, distributed across the study region and specifically associated with the cacao forestry systems in Arauca.New information We present the first database of both climate and agrobiodiversity data related to cacao farms in Arauca, developed with a research and socioeconomic vision that generated a novel approach for the agroclimatic zoning of cocoa in the Arauca Region and Colombia. Using 1,538 cacao farms at the regional scale, we identified two national and six regional -scale climate and soil regions. The selection at the local scale allowed us to classify 180 cacao farms comprising nine agroclimatic clusters in Arauca. We found twenty-six tree species distributed across the cacao climate zones. This dataset and its related maps also represent the agrobiodiversity of cultivated cacao locally. This is the most complete climate and agrobiodiversity dataset of cacao farms distribution in one of the top cocoa-producing regions in the country. These outputs are crucial because they constitute a baseline for developing research in the biodiversity of agroforestry systems, pests and diseases, pollutant presence, genetics, post-harvest processing and cocoa quality and safety.

The GoM and other regions of the U.S. lack sufficient baseline health information to identify, attribute, mitigate, and facilitate prevention of major health effects of disasters. Developing capacity to assess adverse human health consequences of future disasters requires establishment of a comprehensive, sustained community health observing system, similar to the extensive and well-established environmental observing systems. We propose a system that combines six levels of health data domains, beginning with three existing, national surveys and studies plus three new nested, longitudinal cohort studies. The latter are the unique and most important parts of the system and are focused on the coastal regions of the five GoM States. A statistically representative sample of participants is proposed for the new cohort studies, stratified to ensure proportional inclusion of urban and rural populations and with additional recruitment as necessary to enroll participants from particularly vulnerable or under-represented groups. Secondary data sources such as syndromic surveillance systems, electronic health records, national community surveys, environmental exposure databases, social media, and remote sensing will inform and augment the collection of primary data. Primary data sources will include participant-provided information via questionnaires, clinical measures of mental and physical health, acquisition of biological specimens, and wearable health monitoring devices. A suite of biomarkers may be derived from biological specimens for use in health assessments, including calculation of allostatic load, a measure of cumulative stress. The framework also addresses data management and sharing, participant retention, and system governance. The observing system is designed to continue indefinitely to ensure that essential pre-, during-, and post-disaster health data are collected and maintained. It could also provide a model/vehicle for effective health observation related to infectious disease pandemics such as COVID-19. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive, disaster-focused health observing system such as the one proposed here currently in existence or planned elsewhere. Significant strengths of the GoM Community Health Observing System (CHOS) are its longitudinal cohorts and ability to adapt rapidly as needs arise and new technologies develop.

A systematic review of the human health and social well-being outcomes of green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Green infrastructure; Stormwater management; Chronic urban flooding; Program evaluation; Health outcomes; Interdisciplinary research	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECONOMIC VALUATION; INTEGRATING HUMAN; MENTAL-HEALTH; URBAN DESIGN; METRO NATURE; TREE COVER; RISK; VULNERABILITY	Background: The increase in frequency and intensity of urban flooding is a global challenge. Flooding directly impacts residents of industrialized cities with aging combined sewer systems, as well as cities with less centralized infrastructure to manage stormwater, fecal sludge, and wastewater. Green infrastructure is growing in popularity as a sustainable strategy to mimic nature-based flood management. Although its technical performance has been extensively studied, little is known about the effects of green stormwater infrastructure on human health and social well-being. Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature on the effects of green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management on individuals', households', and communities' a) physical health; b) mental health; c) economic well-being; and d) flood resilience and social acceptance of green infrastructure. We systematically searched databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; the first 300 results in Google Scholar; and websites of key organizations including the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Study quality and strength of evidence was assessed for included studies, and descriptive data were extracted for a narrative summary. Results: Out of 21,213 initial results, only 18 studies reported health or social well-being outcomes. Seven of these studies used primary data, and none allowed for causal inference. No studies connected green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management to mental or physical health outcomes. Thirteen studies were identified on economic outcomes, largely reporting a positive association between green infrastructure and property values. Five studies assessed changes in perceptions about green infrastructure, but with mixed results. Nearly half of all included studies were from Portland, Oregon. Conclusions: This global systematic review highlights the minimal evidence on human health and social well-being relating to green infrastructure for stormwater and flood management. To enable scale-up of this type of infrastructure to reduce flooding and improve ecological and human well-being, widespread acceptance of green infrastructure will be essential. Policymakers and planners need evidence on the full range of benefits from different contexts to enable financing and implementation of instfrastructure options, especially in highly urbanized, flood-prone settings around the world. Therefore, experts in social science, public health, and program evaluation must be integrated into interdisciplinary green infrastructure research to better relate infrastructure design to tangible human outcomes.

J	Rücker, A; Boss, S; Kirchner, JW; von Freyberg, J				Ruecker, Andrea; Boss, Stefan; Kirchner, James W.; von Freyberg, Jana			Monitoring snowpack outflow volumes and their isotopic composition to better understand streamflow generation during rain-on-snow events	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION; SIERRA-NEVADA; HEADWATER CATCHMENT; RUNOFF GENERATION; ALPINE CATCHMENT; STABLE-ISOTOPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MELTING SNOW; FLOW PATHS; WATER	Rain-on-snow (ROS) events in mountainous catchments can cause enhanced snowmelt, leading to an increased risk of destructive winter floods. However, due to differences in topography and forest cover, the generation of snowpack outflow volumes and their contribution to streamflow are spatially and temporally variable during ROS events. In order to adequately predict such flood events with hydrological models, an enhanced process understanding of the contribution of rainwater and snowmelt to stream water is needed. In this study, we monitored and sampled snowpack outflow with fully automated snowmelt lysimeter systems installed at three different elevations in a pre-Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. We measured snowpack outflow volumes during the winters of 2017 and 2018, as well as snowpack outflow isotopic compositions in winter 2017. Snowpack outflow volumes were highly variable in time and space, reflecting differences in snow accumulation and melt. In winter 2017, around 815 mm of snowpack outflow occurred at our reference site (grassland 1220 m a.s.l. - metres above sea level), whereas snowpack outflow was 16 % less at the nearby forest site (1185 m a.s.l.), and 62 % greater at another grassland site located 200 m higher (1420 m a.s.l.). A detailed analysis of 10 ROS events showed that the differences in snowpack outflow volumes could be explained mainly by rainfall volumes and initial snow depths. The isotope signals of snowpack outflow were more damped than those of incoming rainwater at all three sites, with the most damped signal at the highest elevation site because its snowpack was the thickest and the residence times of liquid water in its snowpack were the longest, thus enhancing isotopic mixing in the snowpack. The contribution of snowpack outflow to streamflow, estimated with an isotopebased two-component end-member mixing model, differed substantially among the three lysimeter sites (i.e. between 7 +/- 4 and 91 +/- 21 %). Because the vegetation in our study catchment is a mixture of grassland and forest, with elevations ranging from 1000 to 1500 m a.s.l., our site-specific hydrograph separation estimates can only provide a range of snowpack outflow contributions to discharge from different parts of the study area. Thus, the catchment-average contribution of snowpack outflow to stream discharge is likely to lie between the end-member mixing estimates derived from the three site-specific data sets. This information may be useful for improving hydrological models in snow-dominated catchments.

The Role of Snowmelt Temporal Pattern in Flood Estimation for a Small Snow-Dominated Basin in the Sierra Nevada	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						NG-IDF; hyetograph; flood; extremes; hydrologic design; snowmelt	DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTENSITY; RAINFALL; RUNOFF; TEMPERATURE; RADIATION; DESIGN; UPDATE	Prior research confirmed the substantial bias from using precipitation-based intensity-duration-frequency curves (PREC-IDF) in design flood estimates and proposed next-generation IDF curves (NG-IDF) that represent both rainfall and snow processes in runoff generation. This study improves the NG-IDF technology for a snow-dominated test basin in the Sierra Nevada. A well-validated physics-based hydrologic model, the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), is used to continuously simulate snowmelt and streamflow that are used as benchmark data sets to systematically assess the NG-IDF technology. We find that, for the studied small snow-dominated basin, the use of standard rainfall hyetographs in the NG-IDF technology leads to substantial underestimation of design floods. Thus, we propose probabilistic hyetographs that can represent unique patterns of events with different underlying mechanisms. For the test basin where flooding events are generated entirely by snowmelt, we develop a hyetograph that characterizes snowmelt temporal patterns, which greatly improves the performance of NG-IDF technology in design flood estimates. In contrast to the standard rainfall hyetographs characterized by a symmetrically peaked, bell-shaped curve, the snowmelt hyetograph displays a more rapid rise (i.e., greater intensity) and a distinct diurnal pattern influenced by solar energy input. The results also show that the uncertainty of hyetography plays an important role in design flood estimation and can have important implications for future flood projections. Plain Language Summary In recent years, flood hazards have gained increasing attention from national and international homeland security communities. Accurately assessing floods is crucial for many hydrologic applications, including infrastructure design, planning, and renewal, as well as the national flood insurance program. This research focuses on evaluating and enhancing the next-generation flood design technology, which is an improvement over the traditional rainfall-based method that does not account for snow processes in flood generation. Our study reveals a significant underestimation of floods when using standard rainfall temporal pattern in a small snow-dominated basin. To address this issue, we propose probabilistic curves that consider the temporal patterns of snowmelt, resulting in a considerable reduction in flood estimation errors. In contrast to the standard rainfall temporal pattern characterized by a symmetrically peaked, bell-shaped curve, the snowmelt temporal pattern displays a more rapid rise (i.e., greater intensity) and a distinct diurnal pattern influenced by solar energy input. The results demonstrate that the next-generation flood design technology has the potential to complement the traditional method for hydrologic design in snow-dominated regions, providing a consistent design approach in both rain-dominated and snow-dominated areas.

Evaluation of machine learning-based algorithms for landslide detection across satellite sensors for the 2019 Cyclone Idai event, Chimanimani District, Zimbabwe	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Machine learning; Landslide mapping; Remote sensing; Landslide volume estimation	EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; EROSION; IMPACT; HAZARD; SOUTH; INVENTORIES; FREQUENCY; ACCURACY	Changes in climatic patterns, manifested as intensified cyclones and torrential rainfalls in a warming world will inevitably impact the frequency of landslides. One such climatic extreme, Cyclone Idai (March 2019), caused significant havoc across southeastern Africa, including Mozambique, Malawi, and eastern Zimbabwe, by triggering thousands of landslides and widespread concurrent flooding, both of which resulted in substantial loss of life. The study was conducted in the Chimanimani District of eastern Zimbabwe to understand the impact of Cyclone Idai on landslide initiation, quantify the volume of mobilized hillslope material during the event, and compare the event-triggered material release against the annual erosional yield across the study area using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. We evaluated satellite imagery of various resolutions, namely, PlanetScope (3m/px),RapidEye (5m/px), and Sentinel-2 (tom/px) and three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to identify landslides and compared the efficacy of the models. A total of nine predictor variables derived from the satellite imagery and a 3o-m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model were employed to identify landslides and differentiate them from concurrent hydrological flooding. The models classified the study area into three classes: (i) landslides, (ii) flooding, and (iii) unaffected area. The RF model using PlanetScope satellite data attained the highest prediction accuracy of 97.88%, whereas the accuracy of other machine learning model-satellite data combinations ranged between 94.58 and 97.27%. Subsequently, landslide size thresholds were applied on the initially mapped landslides to eliminate noise and uncertainty from the data before estimating the final Cyclone Idai event-triggered landslide volume. A probability density function, which corresponds to a logarithmic plot of non-cumulative landslide frequency against the mapped landslide area, was employed to calculate landslide size thresholds using divergence and rollover point cutoff values. Finally, a landslide area-to-volume power-law scaling relationship was exploited to derive landslide volumes in the study area that ranged between 6.8 x 10(6) to 14.7 x 10(6) m(3) and 9.0 x 10(6) to 19.6 x 10(6) m(3) for divergence and rollover point thresholds, respectively, across the different combinations of machine learning models and satellite sensors. The estimated landslide volume indicates hillslope material liberated by Cyclone Idai was 269 to 345 times greater than the estimated annual average background denudation of the study area computed from a topography-based local erosion model.

Subsequently, leading to the greenhouse gas effect and climate change and contemporarily, quest and usage of fossil fuels has increased dramatically in recent times. The only solution to resolve the problem of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is geological/subsurface storage of carbon dioxide or carbon capture and storage (CCS). Additionally, CO2 can be employed in the oil and gas fields for enhanced oil recovery operations and this cyclic form of the carbon dioxide injection into reservoirs for recovering oil and gas is known as CO2 Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery (EOGR). Hence, this paper presents the CO2 retention dominance in tight oil and gas reservoirs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) of the Alberta Province, Canada. Actually, hysteresis modeling was applied in the oil and gas reservoirs of WCSB for sequestering or trapping CO2 and EOR as well. Totally, four cases were taken for the investigation, such as WCSB Alberta tight oil and gas reservoirs with CO2 huff-n-puff and flooding processes. Actually, Canada has complex geology and therefore, implicate that it can serve as a promising candidate that is suitable and safer place for CO2 storage. Furthermore, injection pressure, time, rate (mass), number of cycles, soaking time, fracture half-length, conductivity, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure were taken as input parameters and cumulative oil production and oil recovery factor are the output parameters, this is mainly for tight oil reservoirs. In the tight gas reservoirs, only the output parameters differ from the oil reservoir, such as cumulative gas production and gas recovery factor. Reservoirs were modelled to operate for 30 years of oil and gas production and the factor year was designated as decision-making unit (DMU). CO2 retention was estimated in all four models and overall the gas retention in four cases showed a near sinusoidal behavior and the variations are sporadic. More than 80% CO2 retention in these tight formations were achieved and the major influencing factors that govern the CO2 storage in these tight reservoirs are injection pressure, time, mass, number of cycles, and soaking time. In general, the subsurface geology of the Canada is very complex consisting with many structural and stratigraphic layers and thus, it offers safe location for CO2 storage through retention mechanism and increasing the efficiency and reliability of oil and gas extraction from these complicated subsurface formations.

To maintain the delivery of soil-related ecosystem services and to promote greater soil resilience it is essential to understand how plant-soil systems respond to these extreme events. In this study we replicated a recent period of extreme rainfall and prolonged spring flooding in a temperate grassland which had no previous history of flooding. Intact soil mesocosms (Eutric Cambisol) 1 kg weight were subjected to a simulated long-term spring flood (15 degrees C, 2 months) and maintained in the light with above ground indigenous vegetation (Loliumperenne L) or dark with and without indigenous vegetation to simulate different flood typologies. In comparison to a no flood control treatment, nutrient cycling, water quality, air quality (greenhouse gas emissions), habitat provision and biological population regulation shifts were evaluated. Flooding induced a rapid release of nutrients into the soil solution and overlying floodwater, resulting in potential nutrient losses up to 15 mg Fe, 16 mg NH4+, 360 mg DOC and 28 mg DON, per mesocosm. The presence of plants increased the rate of nutrient release (especially P), with the effects magnified when light transmission through the floodwater was restricted (1.3 mg P vs 0.2 mg P, per mesocosm). Flooding induced a rapid decline in redox potential and subsequent production of CH4, especially in the darkened treatments (10 and between 11 and 16 times higher than the control, without and with light restrictions, respectively). Upon removal of the floodwater, the accumulated NH4+ was nitrified leading to a shift in greenhouse gas emissions, from CH4 to N2O emissions. N2O was only significantly produced in the mesocosms kept under light restrictions (13 times higher than in other two treatments). Flooding eliminated earthworms, reduced grass production after soil recovery (from 28 g for control mesocosms to 11 g and < 1 g for flooded mesocosms without and with light restrictions, respectively). Soil microbial biomass was also reduced (up to a 22-27% of the total PLFAs) and flooding induced shifts in microbial community structure, particularly a loss of soil fungi. The soil fungi content quickly recovered (4 weeks) when light was not restricted during the flood period, however, no such recovery was seen in the darkened treatments. Overall, we conclude that extreme flood events cause rapid and profound changes in soil function. Both the impact of the flooding and the time to recover is exacerbated when light is restricted (e.g. in sediment laden floodwater). In addition, our results suggest that the presence of flood-resilient plants can mitigate against some of the negative impacts of flooding on soil functioning.

Risks can be defined by physiographical sensitivity and vulnerability associated with socio-economic, demographic and infrastructure aspects of the region. Population with poor socio-economic status and high dependence on natural resources for livelihood in coastal dwellings of rural India are extremely vulnerable to flood hazards. Policy formulation to reduce coastal flood risks necessitates quantifying hazard vulnerability at an administrative scale. In this context, we propose a method for evaluating the coastal flood risk of an island located in the habited part of Sundarbans, West Bengal. Extending up to 282 sq. km, Sagar Island has been a keystone in harbouring and supporting both local and migrant population since the 1880s. Land-use classification of the island indicates an increase of 1.7% to 3.6% in the built-up class, almost double in the past eight years (2012-2020). A considerable rise in area under the water bodies is also seen from 6.6 to 8.6%, signifying fair evidence of a coastal breach. Flood risk assessment of Sagar Island was carried out using high spatial resolution data from Indian remote sensing satellites and census data. This assessment was performed by modifying the established MCDA technique considering the data limitations and accounting accessibility to infrastructure as a novel variable to a multi-dimensional framework. The framework maps spatial vulnerability of the region using sub-factors such as socio-demographic, economic, infrastructure and accessibility. The exposure profile of the area is drawn with the help of topographic factors and classified land-use results. Literature evidence was used to develop classification rules for data standardization from very high to very low based on their flood sensitivity. Further, the factors and sub-factors were ranked using AHP by a panel of experts belonging to diverse fields such as disaster management, regional planning, environment, hydrology and social science. The weighted sum technique was used to quantify total vulnerability and exposure parameters, respectively. The total risk map generated is the product of the hazard and vulnerability map of the region. The findings reveal the dominance of economic and accessibility parameters in defining the vulnerability of the regional population towards coastal flood risks. Proximity to coastline and tidal creeks enhances disaster sensitivity due to frequent inundation, erosion, saltwater intrusion and complete submergence of land area. Water bodies engulfing the coastline emerge as a serious threat to sustenance given the present rate of submergence of about 6 m/year. The research highlights the pressing need for grassroots development through social and economic upliftment. It also advocates the undeniable need for proactive adaptation such as flood resilient housing and coastline protection by stabilizing sandbars and planting/nurturing/maintaining native species (mangroves).

A Computationally Efficient and Physically Based Approach for Urban Flood Modeling Using a Flexible Spatiotemporal Structure	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SURFACE-WATER; HYDROLOGY; GROUNDWATER; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; RESOLUTION; BENCHMARK; RISK	Recent unprecedented events have highlighted that the existing approach to managing flood risk is inadequate for complex urban systems because of its overreliance on simplistic methods at coarse-resolution large scales, lack of model physicality using loose hydrologic-hydraulic coupling, and absence of urban water infrastructure at large scales. Distributed models are a potential alternative as they can capture the complex nature of these events through simultaneous tracking of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes. However, their application to large-scale flood mapping and forecasting remains challenging without compromising on spatiotemporal resolution, spatial scale, model accuracy, and local-scale hydrodynamics. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques that can address these issues in urban systems while maximizing computational efficiency and maintaining accuracy at large scales. This study presents a physically based but computationally efficient approach for large-scale (area > 10(3) km(2)) flood modeling of extreme events using a distributed model called Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with a hyperresolution-fixed-mesh model at 60-m resolution. Application of the proposed approach reduces the number of computational elements by 80% and the simulation time for Hurricane Harvey by approximately 4.5 times when compared to the fixed-resolution model. The results show that the proposed approach can simulate the flood stages and depths across multiple gages with a high accuracy (R-2 > 0.8). Comparison with Federal Emergency Management Agency building damage assessment data shows a correlation greater than 95% in predicting spatially distributed flooded locations. Finally, the proposed approach can estimate flood stages directly from rainfall for ungaged streams. Plain Language Summary Climate change and land development or urbanization is expected to exacerbate both the intensity and frequency of extreme flooding worldwide. As the flood severity rises, there is a growing need to develop flood prediction and alert systems that provide fast and reliable forecasts. Currently, it is extremely difficult to identify how much, when, and where the flooding will occur, which can create uncertainty in evacuation planning and preparation. This study proposes a method to improve the urban flood prediction by incorporating more physicality into the numerical flood models, which enables a better estimation of the depth, location, and arrival time of flooding. The graphical elements used to construct the models result in a better representation of the real-world physical features, thereby improving the accuracy of flood simulation. Moreover, the approach presented here also decreases the computation time required to simulate flooding, which is vital for providing timely forecasts. The proposed methods are tested across a large and complex urban system using the rainfall from Hurricane Harvey (2017) and validated using three additional flood events in Texas, United States.

The sills were emplaced into the volatile-rich sedimentary rocks of the Amazonas and Solimoes basins in northern Brazil. Here we present a new geochemical study of 26 dolerite samples from 6 deep boreholes in the Brazilian basins, including whole-rock major and trace elements, whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopes and detailed biotite mineral chemistry. The bulk of the dolerites are characterized by phenocrysts of clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic to intergranular textures, Fe-Ti oxides, and rare olivine and orthopyroxene. A different mineralogical assemblage (microphenocrysts of alkali-feldspar, quartz, biotite and apatite) is found in small independent domains, localized within the framework of coarser plagioclase and clinopyroxene laths. These fine-grained evolved domains crystallized in late-stage, evolved melt pockets in the interstitial spaces between earlier crystallized coarser grained crystals. The majority of the studied dolerites are generally evolved tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites with low TiO2 concentrations (<2.0 wt.%). Four samples have high TiO2 concentrations (>2.0 wt.%), and are found in the eastern part of the Amazonas Basin. Whole-rock major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope geochemistry of both low and high-Ti sills is similar to that of previously published CAMP rocks from the two magma types. Low-Ti sills show enriched isotopic signatures (Nd-143/Nd-144(201Ma) 0.51215 to 0.51244; Sr-87/Sr-86(201Ma) 0.70568 to 0.70756), coupled with crustal-like characteristics in the incompatible element patters (e.g. depletion in Nb and Ta). Unaltered high-Ti samples show more depleted isotopic signatures (Nd-143/Nd-144(201Ma) 0.51260 to 0.51262; Sr-87/Sr-86(201Ma) 0.70363 to 0.70398). Low-Ti dolerites from both the Amazonas and Solimoes basins contain biotite with extremely high Cl concentrations (up to 4.7 wt.%). We show that there is a strong correlation between host-rock lithology and Cl concentrations in biotite from the dolerites, and interpret this to reflect large-scale crustal contamination of the low-Ti magmas by halite rich evaporites. Our findings support the hypothesis that sill-evaporite interactions increased volatile release during the emplacement of CAMP. This strengthens the case for active involvement of this LIP in the end-Triassic crisis, and suggests that the sub-volcanic part of a LIP can be of major importance in driving climate change and mass extinctions.

Worldwide river basins have observed enormous changes in the land system dynamics as a result of anthropogenic factors such as population, urbanization, development, and agriculture. As is the scenario of various other river basins, the Brahmaputra basin, which falls in China, Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh, is also witnessing the same environmental issues. The present study has been conducted on the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam, India (a sub-basin of the larger Brahmaputra basin) and assessed its LULC changes using a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The study also simulated the changing LULC pattern for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050 using the GIS-based cellular automata Markov model (CA-Markov) to understand the implications of the ongoing trends in the LULC change for future land system dynamics. The current rate of change of the LULC in the region was assessed using the 48 years of earth observation satellite data from 1973 to 2021. It was observed that from 1973 to 2021, the area under vegetation cover and water body decreased by 19.48 and 47.13%, respectively. In contrast, cultivated land, barren land, and built-up area increased by 7.60, 20.28, and 384.99%, respectively. It was found that the area covered by vegetation and water body has largely been transitioned to cultivated land and built-up classes. The research predicted that, by the end of 2050, the area covered by vegetation, cultivated land, and water would remain at 39.75, 32.31, and 4.91%, respectively, while the area covered by built-up areas will increase by up to 18.09%. Using the kappa index (ki) as an accuracy indicator of the simulated future LULCs, the predicted LULC of 2021 was validated against the observed LULC of 2021, and the very high ki observed validated the generated simulation LULC products. The research concludes that significant LULC changes are taking place in the study area with a decrease in vegetation cover and water body and an increase of area under built-up. Such trends will continue in the future and shall have disastrous environmental consequences unless necessary land resource management strategies are not implemented. The main factors responsible for the changing dynamics of LULC in the study area are urbanization, population growth, climate change, river bank erosion and sedimentation, and intensive agriculture. This study is aimed at providing the policy and decision-makers of the region with the necessary what-if scenarios for better decision-making. It shall also be useful in other countries of the Brahmaputra basin for transboundary integrated river basin management of the whole region.

J	Ren, XL; Wang, SL; Yang, PL; Tao, Y				Ren, Xiaolei; Wang, Shaoli; Yang, Peiling; Tao, Yuan			Experimental and modeling evaluation of siphon-type subsurface drainage performance in flooding and waterlogging removal	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Siphon-type subsurface drainage; Flow rate; Conventional subsurface drainage; Improved subsurface drainage; Ponding; HYDRUS-2D model	PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; FLOW; SYSTEMS; FIELD; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; NITRATE; DESIGN	Agricultural subsurface drainage is necessary for crop production in humid, poorly drained regions with frequent rainfall. Flooding and waterlogging have become more widespread and frequent in recent years, and effective measures should be adopted to increase the subsurface drainage capacity and alleviate flooding and waterlogging disasters after short-term heavy rainfall. However, subsurface drainage focused on the layout parameters (drain depth, drain spacing, etc.) in previous studies, and these measures were limited and cumbersome in the improvement of the flow rate of subsurface drainage. Thus, we aimed to alleviate the flooding and waterlogging threats to farmland and innovatively proposed a new method to increase the flow rate of subsurface drainage, namely siphon-type subsurface drainage. The paper evaluated the performance of the siphon-type subsurface drainage by the indoor sand tank test and the HYDRUS-2D model. Three factors were considered during the experiments: conventional and improved subsurface drainage; shallow, medium, and deep drain depth; and the outlet elevation, including the outlet elevation of the drain pipe under the non-siphon drainage and the outlet elevation of the siphon pipe under the siphon drainage. The results indicated that the siphon-type subsurface drainage performed better under the conditions of steady-state ponding and ponding subsided. The flow rate of the siphon-type subsurface drainage was 27.1-45.7%, 41.8-89.8%, and 39.3-50.5% higher than that of con-ventional, thin-improved, and thick-improved subsurface drainage with non-siphon drainage under steady-state ponding, respectively. It also had a significant advantage when the outlet elevation was the same. The siphon-type subsurface drainage could increase the flow rate during ponding subsided and reduce the flow rate atten-uation degree before the ponding disappears. The flooding removal effect of the siphon-type subsurface drainage was significantly better than that of non-siphon subsurface drainage. The water head and flow rate were used to calibrate and validate the HYDRUS-2D model. The results indicated that the simulated values of flow rate matched well with the measured ones and the relative errors were less than 10%. The influence range and ab-solute values of the negative water head increased with the decrease of outlet elevation, and the increase effect of flow rate increased with the decrease of the water head. The siphon-type subsurface drainage has more control distance than the non-siphon. The advantages of siphon-type subsurface drainage are not only prominent in quart sand but also applicable to field soil. The results of this study could provide technical support for the application of flooding and waterlogging removal in areas where waterlogging is prone to occur and could improve the ability of agricultural production to address waterlogging disasters.

Scaling Point-Scale (Pedo)transfer Functions to Seamless Large-Domain Parameter Estimates for High-Resolution Distributed Hydrologic Modeling: An Example for the Rhine River	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						scaling; pedotransfer functions; regionalization; hydrological modeling; parameters	RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; SOIL-MOISTURE; PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECMWF MODEL; REAL-TIME; DATA SETS; CHALLENGES; CATCHMENT; STORAGE	Moving toward high-resolution gridded hydrologic models asks for novel parametrization approaches. A high-resolution conceptual hydrologic model (wflow_sbm) was parameterized for the Rhine basin in Europe based on point-scale (pedo)transfer functions, without further calibration of effective model parameters on discharge. Parameters were estimated on the data resolution, followed by upscaling of parameter fields to the model resolution. The method was tested using a 6-hourly time step at four model resolutions (1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 km), followed by a validation with discharge observations and a comparison with actual evapotranspiration (ETact) estimates from an independent model (DMET Land Surface Analysis Satellite Application Facility). Additionally, the scalability of parameter fields and simulated fluxes was tested. Validation of simulated discharges yielded Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, except for the Alps where a volume bias caused lower performance. Catchment-averaged temporal ETact dynamics were comparable with independent ET estimates (KGE approximate to 0.7), although wflow_sbm model simulations were on average 115 mm yr(-1) higher. Spatially, the two models were less in agreement (SPAEF = 0.10), especially around the Rhine valley. Consistent parameter fields were obtained, and by running the model at the different resolutions, preserved ETact fluxes were found across the scales. For recharge, fluxes were less consistent with relative errors around 30% for regions with high drainage densities. However, catchment-averaged fluxes were better preserved. Routed discharge in headwaters was not consistent across scales, although simulations for the main Rhine River were. Better processing (scale independent) of the river and drainage network may overcome this issue. Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models are used for flood and drought predictions. Most models have parameters, and to increase model performance, hydrologists often tune these parameters by calibration. State-of-the-art gridded hydrologic models have parameter sets per grid cell, leading to many parameters and making current calibration procedures far from ideal. Here, we tested the use of well-known (pedo)transfer functions from literature to estimate these parameter values, something which can reduce the calibration burden. By using parameter-specific upscaling rules to derive seamless parameter maps for the wflow_sbm model, which explicitly takes subsurface lateral flows into account, this gives a model which is scalable to different grid cell sizes. We assessed the approach on multiple model resolutions, and we found consistent parameter fields and the preservation of vertical fluxes. Only routed discharge, a key output, deteriorates for headwater catchments on coarser resolutions. We attribute this to model structure and the derivation procedure of the river network on different scales, resulting in the loss of lateral flow representation on coarser resolutions. Nevertheless, discharge and evapotranspiration simulations are similar to observations and other models. Hence, regionalization with literature transfer functions and upscaling techniques can further lower the calibration burden and enable predictions in ungauged basins. Key Points Seamless distributed parameter maps can be obtained for the gridded hydrologic model wflow_sbm with transfer functions from literature Application of wflow_sbm with these seamless parameter maps yields simulation results with high KGE and NSE across the Rhine basin Fluxes matched across model scales for evapotranspiration, but this match was considerably less for fluxes affected by (sub)surface flows	[Imhoff, R.

Hydrologic responses of single land use urban and forested watersheds and their implications to improving urban drainage design	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Curve number; Rational method; Simple method; Runoff volume; Peak flow rate; Watershed hydrology	DISTRIBUTED CURVE NUMBERS; NASH-SUTCLIFFE; NORTH-CAROLINA; LOW-IMPACT; RUNOFF; SURFACE; QUALITY; MODELS; TIME; BIORETENTION	The need for resilient stormwater infrastructure is increasingly critical as urbanization and climate change continue to threaten water resources. Engineers and practitioners require reliable methodologies to estimate rainfall-runoff responses to adequately size and design sewer pipes and inlets, flood controls, and stormwater control measures (SCMs). The National Resource Conservation Service Technical Release 55 (often referred to as curve number [CN] method), Simple, and Rational methods are methodologies commonly implemented for such designs by regulatory agencies due to the limited inputs needed to estimate runoff; however, uncertainty is present in each model since they simplify actual hydrological processes. In this study, 13 urban and two forested watersheds were monitored, and their observed hydrologic responses were compared to modeled hydrologic responses utilizing the aforementioned methods. Significant differences in observed normalized runoff volumes (i.e., runoff coefficients) and normalized peak flow rates were found between watersheds with similar watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns, demonstrating the meticulous model inputs required to differentiate hydrologic responses between similar watersheds. A suite of alternative predictive models, informed by feature selection algorithms, were formulated and compared to the performance of standard methods. Results suggested that composite CN methods were the best predictors of event runoff volume across all watersheds (Nash Sutcliffe [NSE] and Kling Gupta Efficiencies [KGE] of 0.74 and 0.52, respectively), but were outperformed by the Simple method for watersheds with more than 45% impervious cover (NSE and KGE scores of 0.85 and 0.76, respectively). However, composite CN methods underestimated runoff volume from every watershed, a limitation that was intended to be addressed through the creation of the distributed CN method. In the distributed approach, runoff volume estimations were improved compared to the composite CN approach only when directly connected impervious area in the watershed was extremely high or extremely low. The multi-linear regression runoff volume model created herein did not outperform traditional runoff models except when rainfall depth was less than 12.5 mm (i.e., the storms for which traditional runoff volume estimation methods performed the worst). Uncertainty in modeled peak flow rate was substantially greater than for runoff volume (NSE and KGE scores between 0.48 - 0.55 and 0.39 - 0.67, respectively) across all methodologies. There is a continued need to develop more dependable estimates of peak flow which are critical to the design of pipes, flood routing, and hydrograph prediction. Overall, these results suggest one model is not optimal in all scenarios. Municipalities, regulatory agencies, and stormwater engineers should consider the adoption of multiple methodologies and use guidance from the results herein to provide recommendations as to when each model is most applicable.

Flood Hazard Zone Mapping of Kasari River Basin (Kolhapur, India), Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Flood hazard map; AHP; Weighted overlay analysis; GIS; Remote sensing; Kasari River	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; STATISTICAL-MODELS; AREAS; RISK; DECISION; PREDICTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; BIVARIATE; ELEVATION; RAINFALL	Flood is the most ubiquitous environmental hazard on the earth perhaps because rivers are the most dominant geomorphic agent in the present geological epoch. The actual process of flooding is the outcome of a complex set of control factors where nature and humans play a conjoint role. Unpredictable climate change with its weather phenomena increases the chances of disastrous events like floods, so it is a need to undertake in depth study using advanced techniques like GIS and remote sensing with accurate methods, including appropriate basin factors. The present study has identified the flood hazard zones of the Kasari River catchment, located in the Kolhapur District of Maharashtra. Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques have been used for the attempted research work. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted overlay analysis are the multi-criteria decision-making tools that have been used for preparing the flood hazard zone map of the Kasari River basin. A number of popular approaches to flood hazard mapping use DEMs, discharge data, and flood frequency data such as remote sensing, GIS, and hydrological data. As a phenomenon, flood is complex-caused by a multiplicity of factors-thus, this often overlooks its multidimensionality. This study used a multi-criteria decision-making tool, such as AHP, which has the added advantage of analyzing a large number of input parameters and their comparative analysis; this led to the identification of factors of relative importance. In order to create the map, twelve control parameters were calculated, viz. elevation, slope, distance from the river, flow accumulation, drainage density, topographical wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), curvature, rainfall, land use/land cover, geomorphology, and geology. Among these parameters, elevation is the dominant factor that influences floods, followed by distance from the river. Both factors show a strong negative correlation of r = - 0.81 and r = - 0.70, respectively. Flooding is directly related to the drainage density of a river basin. High drainage density is directly associated with a higher probability of disastrous floods since it indicates high runoff from the surface. The stream network was extracted from the ASTER DEM and a drainage density map was created using the spatial analyst ArcGIS (10.8). This drainage density ranges from 2.2 to 3.8 km/ km(2) in the middle and downstream parts of the study area, which are more likely to cause flooding. Zones of very high flood vulnerability are located in the downstream region, i.e., in the eastern part of the basin. More than 50% of agricultural land and 16% of the settlement areas come under the zone of very high flood vulnerability. The high and moderate flood hazard zone affected areas are 23.05 and 32.11 percent, respectively, which is a cause for concern.

For example, increasing intensity and declining frequency of rainfall in China have led to a prolonged period of drought as well as more floods, with serious impacts on economics and environment. Different hydrological indices, for instance the accumulated precipitation, the Palmer drought severity index etc., which can reflect the intensity of precipitation or drought, have been proposed to understand the change of hydrological cycle. However, they lead to obvious disagreements in case of China's hydrological cycle because various indices emphasis mainly on either wet or dry feature of the hydrological cycle. The disagreements interfere our ability to manage environmental assets, drought risks, and flood hazards. To reconcile these dis-agreements, this study has utilized a hydroclimatic intensity index (HY-INT) which is proposed innovatively by previous study with advantages in quantifying the intensity of hydrological cycle. HY-INT integrates and am-plifies the signals of precipitation intensity and dry spell length, viewing the response of these two metrics to warming as deeply interconnected. An increase of HY-INT represents the accelerated hydrological cycle and the increased risks of wet and/or dry extremes. Based on the daily gauged precipitation at 540 stations within mainland China, this study has assessed the change of HY-INT in China during 1961-2017. The results show an increasing trend of HY-INT in central-east China, indicating the increasing intensity of hydrological cycle (i.e., more severe droughts and/or rainfall events). While a decreasing trend of HY-INT is observed in northwestern China which implies less wet-dry extremes. Future change of HY-INT is further assessed based on the outputs from climate models in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 and phase 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) under the more realistic medium stabilization emission scenarios. The models are weighted by the performances in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter-annual variability of observed HY-INT. Results of weighted multi-model ensemble suggest an increased hydrological cycle over most part of China, especially in the Yangtze River Basin, indicating more wet-dry extremes. While an exception is seen in northwest China where the HY-INT will decline due to the dominance of the decreased dry spell length over the increased precipitation intensity. This reveals an alleviated intensity of hydrological cycle and fewer wet-dry extreme events therein, similar to the change in recent decades. The changes of HY-INT are attributed to the different variation patterns in the pre-cipitation probability, which are associated with the change in atmospheric instability and moisture content.

In this study, repeated channel geometric measurements were used to investigate the channel adjustment to water and sediment changes of the lower Yellow River in China in the past few decades. With a high sediment concentration and large variations of water discharge, the lower Yellow River has a much active channel in its form and location, which has hindered previous research efforts to study long-term differentiated erosion/deposition of different geomorphic units in the channel. In this study, we divided each of four typical channel across-sections at hydrological stations in the lower Yellow River into different units according to the geomorphological features, and give a detailed investigation of erosion/deposition processes of these geomorphic units and the interactions between them besides the influence of incoming water and sediment conditions. The results show that with a significant decreasing trend of both the annual runoff and sediment load of the river and abrupt changes in 1985-1996, the overall siltation trend in the river channel before 1990 had been replaced by a slight erosion trend after 2006. In the earlier period, the siltation in the upstream wandering and transitional reaches mainly occurred on floodplains and that in the downstream straight reaches principally on main channel bed. In the later period, erosion occurred mainly on high and low bank slopes in the wandering reaches and on main channel bed in the transitional reaches. The erosion became weak in the wandering reaches after 2010, continued in the transitional reaches, and was still relatively minor in the straight reaches, reflecting the downstream hysteresis channel response to changes in water and sediment discharges down dams. Our results suggest that the seasonal erosion/deposition of a geomorphic unit of the river channel can be attributed to the changes in water and sediment discharges as well as to the interaction between geomorphic units. Siltation on the main channel bed could be attributed to erosion on the bank slopes in both the sections in the wandering and transitional reaches, and erosion of the main channel bed in flood seasons was negatively related with the mean water discharge at the two sections in the straight reaches. This result implies that fixing the bank slopes in the wandering and transitional reaches and raising the water discharge in the straight reach in flood seasons are favorable options for controlling the development of the two-level perching channel of the lower Yellow River.

Assessing the characteristics and drivers of compound flooding events around the UK coast	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; RIVER FLOW; JOINT PROBABILITY; EXTREME RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER LEVELS; DEPENDENCE; PRECIPITATION; WAVES	In low-lying coastal regions, flooding arises from oceanographic (storm surges plus tides and/or waves), fluvial (increased river discharge), and/or pluvial (direct surface runoff) sources. The adverse consequences of a flood can be disproportionately large when these different sources occur concurrently or in close succession, a phenomenon that is known as "compound flooding". In this paper, we assess the potential for compound flooding arising from the joint occurrence of high storm surge and high river discharge around the coast of the UK. We hypothesise that there will be spatial variation in compound flood frequency, with some coastal regions experiencing a greater dependency between the two flooding sources than others. We map the dependence between high skew surges and high river discharge, considering 326 river stations linked to 33 tide gauge sites. We find that the joint occurrence of high skew surges and high river discharge occurs more frequently during the study period (15-50 years) at sites on the south-western and western coasts of the UK (between three and six joint events per decade) compared to sites along the eastern coast (between zero and one joint events per decade). Second, we investigate the meteorological conditions that drive compound and non-compound events across the UK. We show, for the first time, that spatial variability in the dependence and number of joint occurrences of high skew surges and high river discharge is driven by meteoro-logical differences in storm characteristics. On the western coast of the UK, the storms that generate high skew surges and high river discharge are typically similar in characteristics and track across the UK on comparable pathways. In contrast, on the eastern coast, the storms that typically generate high skew surges are mostly distinct from the types of storms that tend to generate high river discharge. Third, we briefly examine how the phase and strength of dependence between high skew surge and high river discharge is influenced by the characteristics (i.e. flashiness, size, and elevation gradient) of the corresponding river catchments. We find that high skew surges tend to occur more frequently with high river discharge at catchments with a lower base flow index, smaller catchment area, and steeper elevation gradient. In catchments with a high base flow index, large catchment area, and shallow elevation gradient, the peak river flow tends to occur several days after the high skew surge. The previous lack of consideration of compound flooding means that flood risk has likely been underestimated around UK coasts, particularly along the south-western and western coasts. It is crucial that this be addressed in future assessments of flood risk and flood management approaches.

J	Bergerot, B; Bret, V; Cattanéo, F				Bergerot, Benjamin; Bret, Victor; Cattaneo, Franck			Similarity in seasonal flow regimes, not regional environmental classifications explain synchrony in brown trout population dynamics in France	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						classifications; Moran effect; population synchrony; Salmo trutta; spatiotemporal scales	SALMON SALMO-SALAR; SPATIAL SYNCHRONY; FISH POPULATIONS; LARGE-SCALE; WATER TEMPERATURE; TRUTTA L; DISPERSAL; RECRUITMENT; RIVER; VARIABILITY	Investigating the variables driving synchrony in populations and the spatial scales at which they operate is worthwhile for both a basic understanding of population dynamics and for management. Various environmental classifications have been developed to group sites according to predefined similarities in abiotic variables (with spatial and/or temporal components) and to explain population dynamics in running waters. These classifications may be useful to managers and decision makers, as studies have shown relationships between time-dependent population variability and environmental classifications on different spatial scales. We investigated whether synchrony among brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations could be explained by three regional (hydro-ecoregions, hydrological units, and natural flow regime classification) and one local environmental classification and their associated variables. We first analysed whether densities of two size classes (0+ and >0+ fish) varied over a large spatial scale (i.e. 112 sites spread throughout France sampled for >11years). We then determined whether the degree of synchrony matched the spatial patterns defined by the environmental classifications. Finally, we investigated whether variables such as river distance between sites, hydrology, and temperature were associated with patterns of synchrony. Overall, relationships observed between synchronies in environmental variables and trout population densities were weak. Synchrony was best explained by the classification based on hydrological units, defined as discrete physical units that provided boundaries with real biological significance for river assemblages (12% for 0+ density and 9% for >0+ density and total densities). However, when considering environmental variables alone, synchrony in trout populations was mainly associated (from 11% to 23%) with seasonal flow variables such as high flows during reproductive and emergence periods. Temperature and river distance did not explain synchrony between trout populations. High flows during emergence appear to be a key driver of brown trout population dynamics. Floods during the reproductive period could explain synchrony among brown trout populations, although the effect was weaker than that of high flows during the emergence period. We concluded that existing physical, morphological, and biogeographical classifications at regional spatial scales were not sufficiently integrative to account for environmental drivers (such as flow variables) that were most associated with the spatiotemporal patterns of synchrony in trout populations. Flow explained synchrony better than classifications did. Further investigations should focus on the spatial patterns of flow variations during the emergence and reproductive periods to derive geographical areas that best capture synchrony patterns in trout dynamics. This approach could be extended to other freshwater fish species for which climatic drivers are important, and may help to explain the distributional changes of exotic species, the propensity of populations to fluctuate synchronously and the scale of synchrony patterns under different scenarios of climate change, or the threat of extinction of native species if the Moran effect is high.

J	Chen, J; Xu, YG				Chen, Jun; Xu, Yi-gang			Establishing the link between Permian volcanism and biodiversity changes: Insights from geochemical proxies	GONDWANA RESEARCH			English	Review						Permian; Large igneous province; Continental arc volcanism; Environmental change; Mass extinction; Geochemical proxies	LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCE; GUADALUPIAN-LOPINGIAN BOUNDARY; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE RECORDS; SHALLOW-MARINE CARBONATES; TRIASSIC MASS EXTINCTION; SOUTH CHINA IMPLICATIONS; FLOOD-BASALT ERUPTIONS; PALEOZOIC ICE-AGE; MAIN KAROO BASIN; INDUCED DIE-OFFS	Current understanding of biodiversity changes in the Permian is presented, especially the consensus and disagreement on the tempo, duration, and pattern of end-Guadalupian and end-Permian mass extinctions. The end-Guadalupian mass extinction (EGME; i.e., pre-Lopingian crisis) is not as severe as previously thought. Moreover, the turnovers of major fossil groups occurred at different temporal levels, therefore the total duration of the end-Guadalupian mass extinction is relatively extended. By comparison, fossil records constrained with high-precision geochronology indicate that the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) was a single-pulse event and happened geologically instantaneous. Variation of geochemical proxies preserved in the sedimentary records is important evidence in examining potential links between volcanisms and biodiversity changes. Some conventional and non-traditional geochemical proxy records in the Permian show abrupt changes across the Permian-Triassic boundary, reflecting climate change, ocean acidification and anoxia, carbon cycle perturbation, gaseous metal loading, and enhanced continental weathering. These, together with the stratigraphic coincidence between volcanic ashes and the end-Permian mass extinction horizon, point to large-scale volcanism as a potential trigger mechanism. To further define the nature of volcanism which was responsible for global change in biodiversity, main characteristics of four Permian large igneous provinces (LIPs; i.e., Tarim, Panjal, Emeishan, and Siberian) are compared, in terms of timing and tempo, spatial distribution and volume, and magma-wall rock interactions. The comparison indicates that volcanic fluxes (i.e., eruption rates) and gas productions are the key features distinguishing the Siberian Traps from other LIPs, which also are the primary factors in determining the LIP's potential of affecting Earth's surface system. We find that the Siberian Traps volcanism, especially the switch from dominantly extrusive eruptions to widespread sill intrusions, has the strongest potential for destructive impacts, and most likely is the ultimate trigger for profound environmental and biological changes in the latest Permian-earliest Triassic. The role of Palaeotethys subduction-related arc magmatism cannot be fully ruled out, given its temporal coincidence with the end-Permian mass extinction. As for the Emeishan LIP, medium volcanic flux and gas emission probably limited its killing potential, as evident from weak changes in geochemical proxies and biodiversity. Because of its long-lasting but episodic nature, the Early Permian magmatism (e.g., Tarim, and Panjal) may have played a positive role in affecting the contemporaneous environment, as implicated by coeval progressive climate warming, termination of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA), and flourishing of ecosystems.

Fluctuations in streamflow indicate the sensitivity of streamflow responding to extreme precipitation events and other climatic variables (temperature extremes) that play a significant role in its generation. Pakistan is also considered one of the climate change hotspot regions in the world. The devastating impacts have often occurred in recent decades due to an excess or shortage of streamflow, majorly generated from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). To better understand climate extremes' impact on streamflow, this study examined climate extremes and streamflow (Q) changes for three decades: 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2019. Observed streamflow and meteorological data from nine sub-catchments across all climatic zones of the UIB were analyzed using RGui (R language coding program) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Climatic variables were estimated, including precipitation extremes, temperature extremes, and potential evapotranspiration. The Mann-Kendal test was applied to the climatic indices, revealing that precipitation increased during the last 30 years, while maximum and minimum temperatures during the summer months decreased in the Karakoram region from 1990 to 2019. The spatiotemporal trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a more increasing tendency from 1990 to 2019, compared to the consecutive wet days (CWD), which showed a decreasing trend. PLSR was applied to assess the relation between climatic variables (extreme P, T indices, and evapotranspiration). It was found that the dominant climatic variables controlling annual streamflow include the r95p (very wet days) and R25mm (heavy precipitation days), maximum precipitation event amount, CWD, PRCPTOT (annual total precipitation), and RX5 (maximum five-day precipitation). The TXn (Min Tmax) and Tmax mean (average maximum temperature) dominate streamflow variables. Moreover, the impact of evapotranspiration (ET) on variations in streamflow is more pronounced in arid catchments. Precipitation is the predominant factor influencing streamflow generation in the UIB, followed by temperature. From streamflow quantification, it was found that climate-driven annual streamflow decreased during 1999-2019 in comparison to 1990-1999, with an increase in a few catchments like Kalam, which increased by about 3.94% from 2000 to 2010 and 10.30% from 2010 to 2019, and Shigar, which increased by 0.48% from 2000 to 2009 and 37.37% from 2010 to 2019 concerning 1990-1999. These variations were due to changes in these climatic parameters. The PLSR approach enables the identification of linkages between climatic variables and streamflow variability and the prediction of climate-driven floods. This study contributes to an enhanced identification and hydroclimatological trends and projections.

Sepetiba Bay became a lagoonal system due to the evolution and development of the Marambaia barrier island during the Holocene and the presence of an extensive river basin. Elemental concentrations from pre-anthropogenic layers from the nearby SP7 core have been used to estimate the baseline elemental concentrations for this region and to determine metals enrichment factors (EF), pollution load index (PLI), and sediment pollution index (SPI). Record of the core SP8 provides compelling evidence of the lagoon evolution differentiating the effects of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) under natural vs. anthropic forcing in the last similar to 9.5 ka BP. The study area was probably part of coastal sand ridges between approximate to 9.5 and 7.8 ka BP (radiocarbon date). Events of wash over deposited allochthonous material and organic matter between approximate to 8.6 and 7.8 ka. Climatic event 8.2 ka BP, in which the South American Summer Monsoon was intensified in Brazil causing higher rainfall and moisture was scored by an anoxic event. Accumulation of organic matter resulted in oxygen depletion and even anoxia in the sediment activating biogeochemical processes that resulted in the retention of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). After approximate to 7.8 ka BP at the onset of the Holocene sea-level rise, a marine incursion flooded the Marambaia Cove area (previously exposed to subaerial conditions). Environmental conditions became favorable for the colonization of benthic foraminifera. The Foram Stress Index (FSI) and Exp(H'bc) indicate that the environmental conditions turned from bad to more favorable since approximate to 7.8 ka BP, with maximum health reached at approximate to 5 ka BP, during the mid-Holocene relative sea-level highstand. Since then, the sedimentological and ecological proxies suggest that the system evolved to an increasing degree of confinement. Since approximate to 1975 AD, a sharp increase of silting, Cd, Zn, and organic matter also induced by anthropic activities caused major changes in foraminiferal assemblages with a significant increase of Ammonia/Elphidium Index (AEI), EF, and SPI values and decreasing of FSI and Exp(H'bc) (ecological indicators) demonstrating an evolution from "moderately polluted" to "heavily polluted" environment (bad ecological conditions), under variable suboxic conditions. Thus, core SP8 illustrates the most remarkable event of anthropogenic forcing on the geochemistry of the sediments and associated pollution loads and its negative effect on benthic organisms.

Predicting hot spots of aquatic plant biomass in a large floodplain river catchment in the Australian wet-dry tropics	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Floods; Aquatic plant biomass; Rainfall; Climate; Discharge	TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; SURFACE-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; EXTENT DYNAMICS; REGION KAKADU; TIME-SERIES; WEST-AFRICA; INDEX NDWI	Conservation planning processes and wetland management require spatial estimations of aquatic habitats to support the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. However, physical access to several wetlands and freshwater habitats can be restricted due to difficult topography and technological limitations associated with ground-based observations. In addition to these constraints, the distribution of some aquatic primary producers in freshwater habitats and floodplains that are difficult to reach further complicates large-scale assessment of aquatic habitats using traditional field-based techniques. The main objective of this study is to predict the spatial distribution of hot spots of primary producers (aquatic plant biomass) and assess large-scale inundation patterns in a large floodplain wetland (Flinders catchment) in the wet-dry tropics of Australia. To this end, remote sensing bio-physical indicators (vegetation and inundation) were integrated with flood water depth in a classification tree model. Results indicate that in terms of floodplain total inundation, the Flinders wetland hydrology is rather restricted immediately after the summer wet season, the period when most primary production happens. While this can be attributed to the fact that much of the observed annual variability (93%) in rainfall and surface runoff (95%) occur during the wet season, post flood recession patterns are indicators that underpin the somewhat limited alimentation of the Flinders floodplain during this period. As observed in this study, post flood in-undation extents in the summers of 2009 and 2019 declined by approximately 89% and 87% within fourteen and ten days, respectively. Despite having a significantly higher magnitude than the 2009 summer flood event, the 2019 extreme 'big wet' period did not translate to higher floodplain productivity (aquatic plant biomass and surface water distribution) immediately after summer as was the case in 2009. Furthermore, the predicted extents of aquatic plant biomass and total floodplain inundation in the downstream Flinders show substantial temporal variation and suggest the floodplain wetland hydrology is largely driven by inter-annual changes in annual rainfall. The extents of these hot spots of biomass accumulation were found to be considerably associated with total floodplain inundation extent (r = 0.94), rainfall (r = 0.81), and discharge (r = 0.68). Furthermore, advance statistical analyses show that downstream discharge and rainfall over the Flinders are significantly correlated (r = 0.72). In addition to this, observed amplitudes of discharge and rainfall in extreme wet and dry years coincided with floodplain inundation patterns and distribution of hot spots of primary producers. While these relationships emphasize the importance of flow in the nourishment of the downstream catchment, they further corroborate the composite influence of local rainfall and discharge on total floodplain inundation and hot spots of primary producers.

As a result, accurate fore-and nowcasting of impending excessive rainfall is crucial for warning and mitigating these hydro-meteorological hazards. The measurement of integrated water vapour along slant paths is made possible by ground-based global positioning system (GPS) receiver networks, delivering three-dimensional (3D) water vapour distributions at low cost and in real-time. As a result, these data are an invaluable supplementary source of knowledge for monitoring storm events and determining their paths. However, it is generally known that multipath effects at GPS stations have an influence on incoming signals, particularly at low elevations. Although estimates of zenith total delay and horizontal linear gradients make up the majority of the GPS products for meteorology to date, these products are not sufficient for understanding the full 3D distribution of water vapour above a station. Direct utilization of slant delays can address this lack of azimuthal information, although, at low elevations it is more prone to multipath (MP) errors. This study uses the convective storm event that happened on 27 July 2017 over Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey, which caused flash floods and severe damage, to examine the effects of multipath-corrected slant wet delay (SWD) estimations on monitoring severe weather events. First, we reconstructed the one-way SWD by adding GPS post-fit phase residuals, describing the anisotropic component of the SWD. Because MP errors in the GPS phase observables can considerably impact SWD from individual satellites, we used an averaging technique to build station-specific MP correction maps by stacking the post-fit phase residuals acquired from a precise point positioning (PPP) processing strategy. The stacking was created by spatially organizing the residuals into congruent cells with an optimal resolution in terms of the elevation and azimuth at the local horizon.This enables approximately equal numbers of post-fit residuals to be distributed across each congruent cell. Finally, using these MP correction maps, the one-way SWD was improved for use in the weather event analysis. We found that the anisotropic component of the one-way SWD accounts for up to 20% of the overall SWD estimates. For a station that is strongly influenced by site-specific multipath error, the anisotropic component of SWD can reach up to 4.3 mm in equivalent precipitable water vapour. The result also showed that the spatio-temporal changes in the SWD as measured by GPS closely reflected the moisture field estimated from a numerical weather prediction model (ERA5 reanalysis) associated with this weather event.

J	Thalmeier, MB; Kröhling, DM; Brunetto, E				Belen Thalmeier, Maria; Krohling, Daniela M.; Brunetto, Ernesto			The geomorphology and Late Quaternary sedimentary record of the Salado/Juramento fluvial megafan, Central Andes foreland basin (Chaco Plain, Argentina)	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Chaco fluvial megafans; South America; Geomorphology; Quaternary stratigraphy; Neotectonics		This research provides geomorphological and sedimentary data on the Salado-Juramento fluvial megafan, the second largest megafan (204,747 km(2)) of the Chaco aggradational plain, generated by the Salado-Juramento River in NE Argentina. It comprises one of the most extensive depositional systems of the Central Andean foreland basin system in South America, also being among the largest megafans on Earth. Despite this, it has not been previously studied from the perspective of its geomorphology, stratigraphy and dynamic evolution. An integrated approach focusing on the analysis of morpho-sedimentary processes, the resulting landforms and the reconstruction of the Late Quaternary evolution is presented here. The applied methods combine geomorphological mapping from remote sensing images analysis, assessment of landforms and processes, and field data. Historical documents were also analysed. Insights into the near sub-surface stratigraphy were obtained from analysis of research boreholes (up to 30 m depth), integrated with groundwater borehole information. The Fluvial Megafan of the Salado-Juramento Geomophological System comprises four geomorphological units: 1) the middle proximal area of the megafan, 2) the distal area of the megafan, 3) the complex fluvio-aeolian belt of the Golondrinas-Calchaqui, and 4) the present fluvial belt of the Salado. Thirteen geomorphological sub-units were defined and mapped, representing the complexity of sub-environment interactions. Amalgamated braided channel deposits and aggradation lobes with limited floodplain muds are common in the proximal area, while mixed-load, low-energy, narrow, shallow, and sinuous palaeochannels and associated floodplain marsh deposits characterize the distal area, with groundwater discharges and hydromorphic soils. The megafan construction was dominated by short-term sedimentation and channel avulsions to overbank areas. Fan-shaped depositional lobes of the proximal area and sandy channel deposits and sand sheets linked to terminal splays that are covering mud flat deposits (floodplains, including palaeosols) in the middle area suggest a high-flow regime. Neotectonics favoured subsidence, avulsion, and prolonged flooding events, with high potential of preservation of an extensive Late Quaternary wetland unit, ponds, lakes, soils, and loessic deposits in the distal megafan. Aggradation and progradation patterns have been conditioned by tectonic control regulating the interaction between the megafan and its axial trunk river (Parana). Furthermore, the Late Quaternary megafan sequences would also have responded to climatic changes, primarily related to strong hydroclimatic seasonality linked to changes in the South American monsoon system strength. Seasonal high sediment load of the formative river linked to the characteristics of the Andean basin (38,000 km(2)) and its climatic patterns are considered as the main control on megafan dynamics over at least the Upper Quaternary. Morpho-stratigraphical data of the megafan presented here and the first interpretation of its Quaternary evolution is the key to support socio-economic decisions on aquifer exploitation, land uses, and infrastructure planning.

The 3U cubesat constellation of Planet Labs offers the capability of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday at 3-4 m spatial resolution. The higher spatial, as well as temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery in comparison with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, makes it a valuable data source for monitoring the glacial lakes. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of the PlanetScope imagery for glacial lakes mapping with a focus on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKKH) region. Though the revisit time of the PlanetScope imagery is short, courtesy of 130+ small satellites, this imagery contains only four bands and the imaging sensors in these small satellites exhibit varying spectral responses as well as lower dynamic range. Furthermore, the presence of cast shadows in the mountainous regions and varying spectral signature of the water pixels due to differences in composition, turbidity and depth makes it challenging to automatically and reliably extract surface water in PlanetScope imagery. Keeping in view these challenges, this work uses state of the art deep learning models for pixel-wise classification of PlanetScope imagery into the water and background pixels and compares the results with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The deep learning model is based on the popular U-Net architecture. We evaluate U-Net architecture similar to the original U-Net as well as a U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone. In order to train the deep neural network, ground truth data are generated by manual digitization of the surface water in PlanetScope imagery with the aid of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery. The created dataset consists of more than 5000 water bodies having an area of approx. 71km2 in eight different sites in the HKKH region. The evaluation of the test data show that the U-Net with EfficientNet backbone achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.936. A visual comparison with the existing glacial lake inventories is then performed over the Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram range. The results show that the deep learning model detected significantly more lakes than the existing inventories, which have been derived from Landsat OLI imagery. The trained model is further evaluated on the time series PlanetScope imagery of two glacial lakes, which have resulted in an outburst flood. The output of the U-Net is also compared with the GLakeMap data. The results show that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery is a significant advantage in the context of glacial lakes mapping and monitoring.

To differentiate among multiple potential drivers of the capacity loss, we analyze the geomorphic evidence for the potential effects of: flow regulation by two dams constituting the Cushman Hydroelectric Project, which began regulating flow in the river's North Fork in 1925 and diverting water out of the basin in 1930; sediment production from mid-twentieth century logging in the river's South Fork basin; and twentieth century river engineering in the mainstem. Bankfull channel capacity in the mainstem has steadily declined since about 1940 from 370 m(3) s(-1) to <100 m(3) s(-1) due partly to the narrowing of the Skokomish River, which in 2015 was only 45% as wide as it was in 1938. The capacity loss is also due to sediment filling the channel, with nearly 2 m of aggradation measured at a stream gauge since 1965. Comparison of channel cross sections surveyed in 1994, 2007, and 2016 show that about 20,000 m(3) yr(-1) (34,000 Mg yr(-1)) of sediment is accumulating in the Skokomish River. The nature, timing, and spatial pattern of this channel narrowing and shallowing are consistent with the response expected from the Cushman Project, which exports water out of basin and thus substantially reduces downstream flows, but, because the dams were built below a natural lake, does not reduce the sediment supply. While sediment yield from the South Fork is high, accounting for about three-fourths of the total sediment supplied to the Skokomish River, it is dominated by the progressive widening of the channel and recruitment by lateral fluvial erosion of glacial sediments in alluvial terraces; landslides associated with logging in the South Fork basin produced a small amount of sediment relative both to the sediment produced by channel widening in the upper South Fork and to the rate of aggradation in the mainstem Skokomish River. The naturally-high sediment load from the South Fork and the flow reduction in the North Fork result in the unusual effect of flooding having increased downstream of the dams despite substantial reductions to peak flows. This case study illustrates how a watershed-scale analysis of multiple land uses and flow management and their interaction with the basin's geology and geomorphology can make use of geomorphic evidence to differentiate among the possible drivers of channel change and associated flooding.

Water, Water Everywhere, but Every Drop Unique: Challenges in the Science to Understand the Role of Contaminants of Emerging Concern in the Management of Drinking Water Supplies	GEOHEALTH			English	Review						contaminants of emerging concern; water; human health; aquatic life health	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS; ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING COMPOUNDS; ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANTS; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; ECOLOGICAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; THE-DRAIN CHEMICALS; PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES PFASS; RESOLUTION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE GENES	The protection and management of water resources continues to be challenged by multiple and ongoing factors such as shifts in demographic, social, economic, and public health requirements. Physical limitations placed on access to potable supplies include natural and human-caused factors such as aquifer depletion, aging infrastructure, saltwater intrusion, floods, and drought. These factors, although varying in magnitude, spatial extent, and timing, can exacerbate the potential for contaminants of concern (CECs) to be present in sources of drinking water, infrastructure, premise plumbing and associated tap water. This monograph examines how current and emerging scientific efforts and technologies increase our understanding of the range of CECs and drinking water issues facing current and future populations. It is not intended to be read in one sitting, but is instead a starting point for scientists wanting to learn more about the issues surrounding CECs. This text discusses the topical evolution CECs over time (Section 1), improvements in measuring chemical and microbial CECs, through both analysis of concentration and toxicity (Section 2) and modeling CEC exposure and fate (Section 3), forms of treatment effective at removing chemical and microbial CECs (Section 4), and potential for human health impacts from exposure to CECs (Section 5). The paper concludes with how changes to water quantity, both scarcity and surpluses, could affect water quality (Section 6). Taken together, these sections document the past 25 years of CEC research and the regulatory response to these contaminants, the current work to identify and monitor CECs and mitigate exposure, and the challenges facing the future. Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are included in an ever-evolving list of chemicals and microorganisms that are not currently regulated in drinking, recreational, or environmental waters but may be detrimental to human or ecological health. Advances in analytical technology have allowed the detection of these contaminants at ever decreasing concentrations. Additional techniques, such as nontargeted analyses and bioanalytical tools, have expanded our understanding on the occurrence of CECs both individually and in mixtures. Even with new analytical tools, little is known about the potentially tens of thousands of CECs that may be present in water. Models could be used to predict the fate and occurrence of these contaminants. Information on the toxicity to human and aquatic life, both for individual contaminants and mixtures, can follow environmental detection. Advancements in wastewater and drinking water treatment have increased the capacity for the reduction of contaminants in water. More research would be useful to determine human exposures that are occurring through all exposure routes to determine if, and where, additional treatment would be beneficial. If water resources become more limited due to population increases, climatic change, poor treatment performance, or other factors, CECs may become a larger concern for human and ecological health.

Over the past 75 years, Canadian scientists have emerged as international leaders in wetland hydrological research, contributing to a better understanding of wetland form and function. Early Canadian research was instrumental in the development of a classification scheme that provided a foundation for later investigations into vadose zone processes, solute transport, evapotranspiration, ground-ice dynamics, biogeochemical cycling, and modelling. This work has coalesced into a better understanding of the factors that contribute to wetland presence and persistence on the landscape, and the internal processes that result in their unique functions of carbon sequestration, water storage, flood mitigation, water quality enhancement, and wildlife habitat. In Canada and across the world, wetlands are threatened at a range of scales and intensities by disturbances like climate change, resource extraction, wildfire, altered land use, and contamination. In response, Canadian researchers have become global leaders in characterizing the impacts of disturbance on wetland function and been at the forefront of innovative restoration and reclamation techniques. As the value of wetlandisre increasingly acknowledged by stakeholders and decision-makers, the need for evidence-based wetland research will only continue to grow. Canadian scientists are well-positioned to lead wetland hydrology into the next 75 years.Les milieux humides font partie integrante du paysage canadien, offrant des services ecohydrologiques essentiels avec des avantages d'importance mondiale.

Les premieres recherches canadiennes ont joue un role cle dans l'elaboration d'un systeme de classification qui a servi de fondement a des etudes ulterieures sur les processus de la zone non saturee, le transport des solutes, l'evapotranspiration, la dynamique de la glace du sol, le cycle biogeochimique et la modelisation. Ces travaux ont mene a une meilleure comprehension des facteurs qui contribuent a la presence et a la durabilite des milieux humides dans le paysage, les processus internes qui donnent lieu a leurs fonctions uniques de sequestration du carbone, de stockage de l'eau, de mitigation des inondations, d'amelioration de la qualite de l'eau, et d'habitats fauniques. Au Canada et partout dans le monde, les milieux humides sont menaces a diverses echelles et intensites par des perturbations telles que le changement climatique, l'extraction de ressources, les feux de foret, l'utilisation des terres modifiee et la contamination. En reponse, les chercheurs canadiens sont devenus des leaders mondiaux dans la caracterisation des impacts des perturbations sur la fonction des milieux humides et ont ete a l'avant-garde de techniques innovantes de restauration et de remise en etat. A mesure que la valeur des milieux humides est de plus en plus reconnue par les parties prenantes et les decideurs, le besoin de recherche sur les milieux humides basee sur des preuves ne fera que croitre. Les chercheurs canadiens sont bien positionnes pour continuer a diriger la recherche en hydrologie des milieux humides au cours des 75 prochaines annees.

J	Wangchuk, S; Bolch, T; Robson, BA				Wangchuk, Sonam; Bolch, Tobias; Robson, Benjamin Aubrey			Monitoring glacial lake outburst flood susceptibility using Sentinel-1 SAR data, Google Earth Engine, and persistent scatterer interferometry	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sentinel-1; SAR; Radar backscatter; Google Earth Engine; Persistent scatterer interferometry; Glacial lake monitoring; Glacial lake hazard; Slope stability; Outburst susceptibility	MORAINE-DAMMED LAKES; HIGH-MOUNTAIN ASIA; CATASTROPHIC DRAINAGE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; INVENTORY; HIMALAYA; REGION; HAZARD; RISK; IMPACTS	Continuous monitoring of glacial lakes, their parent glaciers and their surroundings is crucial because possible outbursts of these lakes pose a serious hazard to downstream areas. Ongoing climate change increases the risk of this hazard globally due to recession of glaciers leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes, and permafrost degradation which impacts the stability of glaciers, slopes and moraines. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for monitoring lake outburst susceptibility using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (S-1 SAR) data. We selected Lunana in the Bhutanese Himalayas as an example region as it is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods and suitable baseline data were available. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate average radar backscatter intensity (ARBI) of glaciers, lakes, basins, and moraines. To determine the periodicity of the highest and the lowest radar backscatter intensity, we denoised the ARBI data using a Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelated using a Pearson correlation function. Additionally, we determined glacier melt area, basin melt area, lake area, open water area, and lake ice area using radar backscatter intensity data. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique was used to investigate the stability of moraines and slopes around glacial lakes. The PSI results were qualitatively validated by comparison with high-resolution digital elevation model differencing results. Our approach showed that glaciers and basins in the region underwent seasonal and periodic changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to changes in ice and snow melt. Lakes also showed seasonal changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to the variation of lake ice and open water area, but the radar backscatter intensity change was not periodic. We could also infer lake area change using a time-series radar backscatter intensity data such as the rapid expansion of Bechung Tsho. The PSI analysis showed that all the terminal moraines were stable except Drukchung Tsho. Its terminal moraine showed subsidence at the rate of -5.18 mm/yr. Sidewalls of lakes were also stable with the exception of Lugge Tsho at site 4. Due to the free availability of S-1 SAR data, the efficiency of processing a large amount of imagery within GEE, and the PSI technique, we were able to understand the outburst susceptibility of glacial lakes in the region at great detail. The regular acquisition of S-1 SAR data enables continuous monitoring of glacial lakes. A similar approach and concept can be transferred to any geographic region on earth that shares similar challenges in glacial lake monitoring.

However, the transport and burial of flood-driven terrestrial organic carbon (C-org) in river-dominated marginal seas remains poorly understood. Here, water column particles (surface, intermediate, and bottom layers) and surface sediments from the Yangtze River estuary system were collected during a large flooding event (>60,000 m(3) s(-1)) for a multiproxy geochemical study. We analyzed N/C, delta C-13(org), delta N-15, (FC)-C-1-C-4, grain size, and elemental (Al and Si) to characterize the sources, ages, and alterations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and sedimentary C-org from the river channel to the estuarine mixing zone to the continental shelf and fingerprint the fate of C-org burial in marine sediments. We found that terrestrial POC delivered by the Yangtze flood is characterized by low (FC)-C-14 (0.625 +/- 0.002; Delta C-14 = -379. 8 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand, C-14 age = 4,135 yr before present (BP)) and delta C-13(org) (-27.1 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand) values and high delta N-15 (3.9 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand), and N/C (0.15 +/- 0.01) values, and was adsorbed on fine-grained particles. Using a Bayesian-Monte Carlo simulation approach, we estimated that terrestrial POC is dominated by C-3 plant detritus (42 +/- 16% on average), followed by petrogenic organic carbon (33 +/- 7%), and soil (26 +/- 22%). Moving offshore, hydrodynamic sorting of lithogenic particles exerts first-order control on POC by selecting particles with unique signatures. Petrogenic organic carbon and aged plant debris associated with coarse-sized particles preferentially accumulated within the proximal delta, whereas POC derived from catchment soil and adsorbed on fine-grained particles was transported offshore along the sediment dispersion system. We estimated that, on average, 76 +/- 18% of POC initially present in the water column is oxidized at the water column-seabed interface during seaward transport and constitutes a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In contrast, the stable form of the organic matter-aluminosilicate mineral association controls the preservation of the sedimentary C-org. Our results suggest that frequent flooding events in the near future will likely increase lithospheric C-org delivery to marine sediments and have the potential to promote petrogenic C-org burial efficiency in the river-dominated marginal seas and accelerate biospheric POC oxidation and CO2 release, thus generating a positive feedback to global warming.

Dissolved organic carbon dynamics and fluxes in Mississippi-Atchafalaya deltaic system impacted by an extreme flood event and hurricanes: a multi-satellite approach using Sentinel-2/3 and Landsat-8/9 data	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						DOC; fluxes; coastal; extreme flood; hurricanes; Mississipi River; Atchafalaya River; ocean color	QUASI-ANALYTICAL ALGORITHM; OCEAN COLOR; BARATARIA BASIN; BIOOPTICAL PROPERTIES; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL OCEAN; IN-SITU; MATTER	Transport of riverine and wetland-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) spanning tidal wetlands, estuaries, and continental shelf waters functionally connects terrestrial and aquatic carbon reservoirs, yet the magnitude and ecological significance of this variable and its spatiotemporal linkage remains uncertain for coastal deltaic regions, such as Mississippi River Delta Plain, which includes Mississippi (MR) and Atchafalaya (AR) rivers and estuaries with vast expanses of wetlands and coastal forests. We examined DOC dynamics and fluxes in this large river-dominated wetland-estuarine system for the period between 2019 and 2021 that included an extreme river flood event in 2019, two major hurricanes (Barry in 2019 and Ida in 2021), and cold front passage using an improved adaptive quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA-AD) applied to multi-satellite sensors (Sentinel 3A/B OLCI, Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2A/B MSI) with varying spectral and spatial (10/30/300 m) resolutions. The DOC estimates from multi-satellite sensors in combination with water fluxes were used to assess DOC fluxes from two large rivers (MR and AR) and small channels across the delta plain. Overall, this system delivered a total of 6.7 Tg C yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12)g) into the estuarine zone and the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) during 2019. High DOC fluxes from the AR (1.3 Tg C yr(-1)) and MR (4.5 Tg C yr(-1)) were associated with the extreme flood event in 2019. Hurricanes that occurred in the study period also contributed to the wetland and estuarine DOC fluxes into continental shelf waters; for example, the passage of Hurricane Barry in July 2019, delivered over a 3-day period similar to 1.33 x10(9) g DOC from Barataria Basin into the nGoM. Sentinel 2-MSI land and water classification revealed that Hurricane Ida eroded a total of 1.34x10(8) m(2) of marshes in middle Barataria Basin, converting those habitats into open water with 3.0 m inundation depth and high DOC concentrations (16.4 mg L-1), a potentially large DOC source to the coastal waters. Overall, storms and flood events are major sources of DOC flux that facilitate transport of upstream carbon as well as transformation of carbon in the wetlands, through the conversion of vegetated wetland to open water.

Geochemical properties of blue carbon sediments through an elevation gradient: study of an anthropogenically impacted coastal lagoon	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Blue carbon; Saltmarsh; Geochemical properties; Elevation gradient; Anthropogenically impacte	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; SALT-MARSH SEDIMENT; DUBLIN BAY; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; HEAVY-METALS; MATTER; ACCUMULATION; NUTRIENT	Global research is showing that coastal blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change driven threats including accelerated sea-level rise and prolonged periods of drought. Furthermore, direct anthropogenic impacts present immediate threats through deterioration of coastal water quality, land reclamation, long-term impact to sediment biogeochemical cycling. These threats will invariably alter the future efficacy of carbon (C) sequestration processes and it is imperative that currently existing blue carbon habitats be protected. Knowledge of underlying biogeochemical, physical and hydrological interactions occurring in functioning blue carbon habitats is essential for developing strategies to mitigate threats, and promote conditions to optimise C sequestration/storage. In this current work, we investigated how sediment geochemistry (0-10 cm depth) responds to elevation, an edaphic factor driven by long-term hydrological regimes consequently exerting control over particle sedimentation rates and vegetation succession. This study was performed in an anthropogenically impacted blue carbon habitat along a coastal ecotone encompassing an elevation gradient transect from intertidal sediments (un-vegetated and covered daily by tidal water), through vegetated salt marsh sediments (periodically covered by spring tides and flooding events), on Bull Island, Dublin Bay. We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics in sediments through the elevation gradient, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total metals, silt, clay, and also, 16 individual polyaromatic hydrocarbon's (PAH's) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Elevation measurements for sample sites were determined on this gradient using a LiDAR scanner accompanied by an IGI inertial measurement unit (IMU) on board a light aircraft. Considering the gradient from the Tidal mud zone (T), through the low-mid marsh (M) to the most elevated upper marsh (H), there were significant differences between all zones for many measured environmental variables. The results of significance testing using Kruskal-Wallis analysis revealed, that %C, %N, PAH (mu g/g), Mn (mg/kg), TOC:NH4+ and pH are significantly different between all zones on the elevation gradient. The highest values for all these variables exists (excluding pH which followed a reverse trend) in zone H, decreasing in zone M and lowest in the un-vegetated zone T. TC content is 16 fold higher overall in vegetated (3.43 -21.84%) than uninhabited (0.21-0.56%) sediments. TN was over 50 times higher (0.24-1.76%), more specifically increasing in % mass on approach to the upper salt marsh with distance from the tidal flats sediments zone T (0.002-0.05%). Clay and silt distributions were greatest in vegetated sediments, increasing in % content towards upper marsh zones The retention of water, metals, PAHs, mud, chloride ions, NH4+, PO43- and SO42- increased with elevated C concentrations, concurrently where pH significantly decreased. Sediments were categorized with respect to PAH contamination where all SM samples were placed in the high polluted category. The results highlight the ability of Blue C sediments to immobilise increasing levels of C, N, and metals, and PAH with over time and with both lateral and vertical expansion. This study provides a valuable data set for an anthropogenically impacted blue carbon habitat predicted to suffer from sea-level rise and exponential urban development. {GRAPHIS}	[Grey, Anthony; Kelleher, Brian P.] Dublin City Univ, Sch Chem Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Costeira, Ricardo; Allen, Christopher C.

Optimal Preventive Maintenance, Repair, and Replacement Program for Catch Basins to Reduce Urban Flooding: Integrating Agent-Based Modeling and Monte Carlo Simulation	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						catch basins; preventive maintenance; urban flooding; agent-based modeling; Monte Carlo simulation	STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEDIMENT CAPTURE; URBANIZATION; EFFICIENCY; CITY; ENVIRONMENT; INSERTS; IMPACT; SIZE	Urban sprawl has resulted in great losses of vegetation areas, an increase in impervious surfaces, and consequently the direct flow of stormwater into stream channels (i.e., the immediate flow of stormwater into stream channels, in comparison to the indirect flow that is represented by practices aiming to retain stormwater for a certain period of time and treat the polluted stormwater prior to flowing into the stream channels such as detention/retention basins, among others). Stormwater management systems such as catch basins (CBs) are needed to reduce the effect of stormwater runoff. Preventative maintenance, repair, and replacement of CBs are critical to achieve stormwater management best practices. Those practices prevent the blockage of the stormwater system, limit the pollutants in storm sewers, and reduce the risk of flooding. However, no preceding research studies have been conducted to model and simulate the serviceability of CBs and to determine optimal strategies for operating CBs. To that extent, this study establishes a framework to develop and validate an optimal and adaptive maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) strategy for CBs. In relation to that, an agent-based model (ABM) integrated with Monte Carlo simulation was developed for all 560 CBs in New York City's District 5 and was statistically validated using 99% confidence intervals. The MRO parameters were optimized to minimize the total cost of the system and attain the desired level of serviceability of CBs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to guide the maintenance planning process of CBs and reveal the effect of the input parameters on the model's behavior. In addition, ten thousand Monte Carlo iterations were simulated to derive the distributions of the defined parameters. The results proved that in order to minimize the overall cost of repair, maintenance, and replacement of CBs and attain a minimum serviceability threshold of 80%, the following optimal MRO policy needs to be implemented: having seven service crews (where service crews are human resources (i.e., MRO teams) needed to perform the required maintenance, repair, and replacement work), implementing a replacing policy, and replacing CBs after five maintenance periods. The findings revealed that the service crews represent the most critical parameter in affecting the total cost and serviceability of CBs. This research contributes to the existing literature by offering a better knowledge of the management process of CBs and devising optimal MRO strategies for properly operating them. Ultimately, this research helps decision-makers and engineers increase the lifespan of CBs and limit their risks of breakdown, increase their efficiency, and avoid unnecessary costs. The proposed model is flexible and can be implemented to any geographical area and with other model/system parameters, which makes it adaptive for any scenario and area presented by the user. Finally, maintaining stormwater management practices helps in protecting the environment by decreasing the demand on stormwater systems, reducing flooding, protecting people and properties, promoting healthier rivers, and consequently creating more sustainable communities.

Owing to climate change, these riparian zones are often submerged or dried. This not only results in the instability of biodiversity in these regions but also affects the soil biogeochemical cycles. Soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry plays a vital role in predicting and understanding the balance of multiple chemicals in ecological interactions. However, few studies have examined the soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry in riparian zones of Hulunbuir steppe under different submergence states. Our objectives were to explore whether submergence frequencies impact soil C:N:P stoichiometry and identify the key factors. Materials and methods Four study sites were selected along the Hui river in Hulunbuir steppe, and three plots of different submergence frequencies, high (HF-sub, 5 to 7 times per year), moderate (MF-sub, 2 to 3 times per year), and low (LF-sub, unflooded or flooded once per year), were selected for each study site. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), their ecological stoichiometric ratios (soil C:N, N:P, and C:P), soil ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), available phosphorus (AP), soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil moisture content (SMC), soil bulk density (SBD), porosity, and hardness were measured and analyzed. Results and discussion The results indicated that soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry was notably affected by submergence frequency across the four study sites (P < 0.05). SOC, TN, TP, and their stoichiometric ratios changed regularly with the submergence frequency change, whereas their trends were inconsistent at different drainage basins. Soil C:N decreased with the decrease in submergence frequency but kept in a narrow scope, whereas the N:P and C:P were changed greatly under different submergence frequencies. Further analysis found that these significant variations in N:P and C:P were mainly due to the changes in soil TP which suggested there might be a P limitation in the riparian zones. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) and path analysis indicated that soil AP and NO3--N were the key indirect factors affecting soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry under different submergence frequencies, and SMC was an indirect factor. Conclusions We demonstrated that the soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry was significantly affected by the submergence frequency in the riparian zones of Hulunbuir steppe. Soil N:P and C:P were more susceptible to change than C:N under different submergence frequencies. If the contents of soil AP and NO3--N were appropriate, soil C:N:P ecological stoichiometry will be more beneficial to regulating the cycle and balance of soil nutrient elements in the riparian zones, which can promote the riparian zones to provide better ecological functions.

To constrain the seasonal variability, we present Fe concentrations and isotopic compositions (delta Fe-56) for particulate (>0.22 mu m) and colloidal (<0.22 <mu>m-1 kDa) Fe from the Lena River, NE Russia. Samples were collected every month during winter baseflow (September 2012-March 2013) and every 2-3 days before, during and after river ice break-up (May 2015).Iron in particles have isotope ratios lower than crustal values during winter (e.g., delta Fe-56(Part) = -0.37 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand), and crustal-like values during river ice break-up and spring flood (e.g., delta Fe-56(Part) = 0.07 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand), indicating a change in the source of particulate Fe between winter and spring flood. Low isotope values are indicative of mineral dissolution, transport of reduced Fe in sub-oxic, ice-covered sub-permafrost groundwaters and near-quantitative precipitation of Fe as particles. Crustal-like isotopic compositions result from the increased supply of detrital particles from riverbank and soil erosion during river ice break-up and flooding. Iron colloids (<0.22 mu m) have delta Fe-56 values that are comparable to or lower than crustal values during winter (e.g., delta Fe-56(Col) = -0.08 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand) but similar to or higher than crustal values during spring flood (e.g., delta Fe-56(Col) = +0.24 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand). Low delta Fe-56 ratios for colloidal Fe during winter are consistent with precipitation from isotopically light Fe(II)(aq) transported in sub-permafrost groundwaters. Higher colloidal delta Fe-56 ratios during the spring flood indicate that these colloids are supplied from surface soils, where Fe is fractionated via oxidation or organic carbon complexation, similar to during summer. Approximately half of the annual colloidal Fe flux occurs during spring flood while most of the remaining colloidal Fe is supplied during summer months. The total amount of colloidal Fe transported during winter was relatively low. The seasonal variation in colloidal Fe isotope values may be a useful tool to trace the source of colloidal Fe to the Arctic Ocean and monitor future changes in the sources and supply of Fe from the permafrost landscape to the Lena River basin.

In this context, well-stratified salt-marsh sediment sequences provide an exceptional archive to evaluate the response of coastal wetlands to past stormclimate variability. Hence, this study focusses on the investigation of two sedimentary salt-marsh sequences from the south-eastern German North Sea coast (Bay of Tumlau and Friedrichskoog) to understand how and to which extent changes in the storm-surge climate are transferred into the sediment archive. This objective is particularly challenging as German mainland salt marshes have been greatly altered by human activities over the last century. To overcome this problem, this study combines different sedimentological and geochemical proxy data, using mean grain sizes together with ln(Br/Cl), Br/Corg, and ln(Zr/Rb) ratios, to allow for the identification of storm-surge layers. Local changes in the sedimentary organic matter supply are reflected by the ln(Br/Cl) ratio. There, abrupt drops in the ln(Br/Cl) data coincide with relatively coarser textured sand layers, indicating impacts by regional storm surges during winter, while intervals of comparable higher ln(Br/Cl) values may represent deposition during spring to fall. The Br/Corg record reflects the marine versus terrestrial organic matter input and reveals a long-term increase starting during the first half of the 20th century towards recent times, resembling the observed amplification in North Sea storminess. A similar trend is reflected by the ln(Zr/Rb) ratio (since 1950 CE), which can be used as a proxy for the grain-size distribution. Periodic fluctuations in the ln(Zr/Rb) ratio at inter-decadal timescales (10-19 years) suggest a close linkage between local sediment accretion and large-scale atmosphere-ocean climate oscillations over the North Atlantic and Europe, and thus related storm-surge frequency and intensity. Periodic variability on decadal scales was also identified in the ln(Br/Cl) record at the less human-modified and more naturally developed salt marsh at the Bay of Tumlau (12-22 years), likewise indicating a relation between North Sea storminess and associated shifts in the seasonal signal of the primary production and sediment texture to oscillations in the atmosphere-ocean system. On the contrary, similar periodicities are lacking for the intense modified salt marsh at Friedrichskoog. Apparently, the salt-marsh depositional system in the Bay of Tumlau reacts more sensitively to super-regional climatic changes, respectively, the natural depositional processes in the salt marsh at Friedrichskoog are superimposed by the more intense local human activities.

However, climate signals may be overprinted or even be destroyed by autogenic processes caused by channel avulsion and lobe switching. Here we present new data from two different Late Pleistocene (MIS 3-2) alluvial fan systems in northern Germany and compare these systems to experimental alluvial fans and other field examples. The selected fan systems formed under similar climatic and tectonic conditions, but differ in size, type, and drainage area allowing to estimate the role of climate and autogenic controls on flow processes, facies architecture, and fan-stacking patterns. Luminescence dating is used to determine the timing of fan onset and aggradation. Fan onset occurred in response to climate change at the end of MIS 3 when temperatures decreased and periglacial climate conditions were established in northern central Europe. A related increase in sediment supply and strongly variable precipitation patterns probably promoted fan formation. The major period of fan aggradationwas approximately between 33 and 18 ka, followed by fan inactivity, abandonment, and incision during the Lateglacial. The highest aggradation rates occurred during the early stage of fan building, when up to 35 m thick sediment accumulated within a few thousand years. Sand-rich, sheetflood-dominated fans are related to larger, low-gradient fan catchments. Steep depositional fan slopes (5 degrees 17 degrees) and short-lived high-energy floods promoted supercritical flowconditions. Well sorted, sediment-laden, rapidly waning flows favored the deposition and preservation of supercritical bedforms and allowed for the aggradation of stable antidunes. Steep, dip-slope catchments enhanced stream gradients and promoted the transport of coarser sediments. These fans have lower gradient slopes (2-6 degrees) and are dominated by channelized flows, alternating with periods of unconfined sheetfloods. Meter-scale coarsening upward successions, characterized by sandy sheetflood deposits at the base, overlain by multilateral or smaller single-story gravelly channel fills may be related to highfrequency climatic fluctuations or seasonal fluctuations in water and sediment supply. These coarsening-upward successions are commonly bounded by a paleo-active layer, from which ice-wedge casts penetrate downwards. The comparison to experimental fans and other field examples implies that the recurrent pattern ofmultistory, multilateral and single-story channel bodieswith a lateral offset to vertical stacking patternmost probablywas controlled by autogenic switch in an avulsion-dominated system. The change in deposition from alluvial-dominated processes to aeolian sedimentation with minor alluvial influences during the Lateglacial records alternation of dry and ephemeral wetter phases that are related to rapid climatic variations. The main phase of aeolian sand-sheet deposition probably correlates with Heinrich event H1 between approximately 18-16 ka and reflects sedimentation in response to aridification and highmeanwind speeds.

J	Choobeh, S; Abghari, H; Erfanian, M				Choobeh, Sepideh; Abghari, Hirad; Erfanian, Mahdi			Spatial and temporal variability of precipitation based on marginal and apportionment entropy disorder indices in Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Disorder index; Iran; Shannon entropy; Trend analysis; Temporal variability; Precipitation; Spatial variability	SHANNON-INFORMATION ENTROPY; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; SUMMER RAINFALL; TRENDS; SCALES; SIGNAL; SPACE; TESTS	Variations in rainfall are a significant characteristic of semi-arid climates, and it is expected that climate change will increase this variability in many such regions. To effectively plan and manage water resources, mitigate floods and droughts, and control erosion, among other tasks, it is essential to comprehend the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. Although many approaches have been proposed and applied to rainfall data in various regions around the world, our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall remains limited. Previous studies have mainly focused on the amount and spatial patterns of rainfall, with limited investigations of spatiotemporal variability at different scales. To address this knowledge gap, this study employed a spatiotemporal framework to evaluate the dispersion and uncertainty of precipitation in Iran. The study utilized data from 50 synoptic stations spanning the period between 1980 and 2020 and applied the concept of entropy to examine the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation. The marginal entropy (ME) was used to analyze the variability of monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation series. In addition, the apportionment entropy (AE) was applied to the time series to investigate the intra-annual and decadal distribution of monthly and annual precipitation values. The study also utilized the Mann-Kendall test to examine the marginal and relative entropy trends of the study stations. Standardized variability index results revealed that September had the highest rainfall variability, with an average of 0.529, while January had the lowest rainfall variability, with an average of 0.083. Precipitation variability was found to be higher in the summer and spring seasons than in the winter and fall. Moreover, the mean value of the standardized variability index (SVIAE) during the study period was found to be 0.661. Stations with an index value less than 0.661 were found to have a more uniform and evenly distributed rainfall and lower variability. The spatial distribution of annual SVIME indicates that stations in the central and southeastern regions of Iran have higher irregularity. Also, the results show that each season has a unique spatial variability pattern of precipitation irregularity. In the spring, the stations with the highest variability are stations number Chabahar, Jask, Kish, Bandar abbas, Bandar lengeh, Iranshahr, and Zabol. In the summer, stations Zabol, Booshehr, Kish, Bandar lengeh, and Ahvaz exhibit the highest variability. Also, in the autumn season, stations Chabahar, Jask, Iranshahr, Zahedan, and Bandar abbas show the highest variability. In the winter, the southern and southeastern parts of Iran, including stations such as Chabahar, exhibit the highest precipitation variability.

Possible decryption of these signatures stems from careful scrutiny of the sed-imentation dynamics (temporary base-level variations), lake-level fluctuations (accommodation), and resulting strata bounding surfaces that are used to build a conventional sequence stratigraphic framework. However, due to discrepancies between marine, to which this approach has been initially dedicated, and lacustrine settings (es-pecially regarding the physical scale), deciphering climate from tectonic forcing becomes unwieldy in such inte-rior basins. The present work deals with this challenge and provides insights from a case study where lacustrine sedimentation occurs on a tectonically active half-graben within a key climate region (Lake Ifrah, Northwest Af-rica). We conducted conventional sedimentological and high-resolution sequence-stratigraphic analyses, inte-grated with palaeolimnological proxies (geochemical elements and ostracod species). Up to five facies models (accounting for lithological domination, wind-driven energy, and lake-level state) and three lowest rank T-R se-quences, deposited since the Marine Isotope Stage-3 (MIS-3), have been identified. Periods with sustained high lake levels appear to be mainly precession-paced (as during MIS-3 and the Early Holocene), although the role of obliquity is shown to influence the hydrological budget as well. Furthermore, sedimentation dynamics are shown to respond to millennial timescale climate variability associated with North Atlantic cooling events (Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials, Heinrich Events) and, interestingly, to enhanced Saharan winds during the deglacial period. On the other hand, tectonism had a rather instantaneous effect on lake level and sedimentation. Two tectonic pulses marking instantaneous differential hanging-wall subsidence have triggered a sharp drop in relative lake level, hence conditioning a forced regression.We highlight the importance of the conventional high-resolution sequence stratigraphy in shaping our under-standing of the cyclic interplay between orbital/sub-orbital and tectonic forcings, so as the resulting sedimenta-tion dynamics and lake-level cycles in lacustrine settings. We stress the role of the forced regression concept and associated systems tract and bounding surfaces, as well as the importance of using ostracods and geochemical proxies to trace transgressions and cryptic surfaces with sequence-stratigraphic significance, such as the maxi-mum flooding surface, in lacustrine settings.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

J	Peck, EK; Wheatcroft, RA; Brophy, LS				Peck, Erin K.; Wheatcroft, Robert A.; Brophy, Laura S.			Controls on Sediment Accretion and Blue Carbon Burial in Tidal Saline Wetlands: Insights From the Oregon Coast, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						tidal saline wetlands; blue carbon; sediment accretion; Oregon	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT-MARSH; ACCUMULATION RATES; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; ESTUARINE; PATTERNS; PB-210; SOILS; DEPOSITION; LOUISIANA	Oregon estuaries provide important opportunities to assess controls on tidal saline wetland carbon burial and sediment accretion as both rates of relative sea level rise (RSLR; -1.4 0.9 to 2.8 0.8 mm yr(-1)) and fluvial suspended sediment load relative to estuary area (0.23 to 17 x 10(3) t km(-2) yr(-1)) vary along the coast. We hypothesized that vertical accretion, measured using excess Pb-210 in least-disturbed wetlands within seven Oregon estuaries, would vary with either RSLR or sediment load relative to estuary area, and carbon burial would correlate strongly to sediment accretion. Mean rates of high marsh accretion (0.8 0.2 to 4.1 0.2 mm yr(-1)) indicate that Oregon tidal wetlands have mainly kept pace with twentieth-century RSLR with the exception that the accretionary balance in the central coast is negative, suggesting drowning. Experiencing the fastest rates of RSLR, central-coast estuaries may foreshadow the fates of other Oregon estuaries under future accelerated sea level rise. Comparison of mass accumulation rates with sediment loads, however, indicates low trapping efficiency and therefore no fluvial sediment limitation. Thus, nonlinear feedback between RSLR and sediment accretion may enhance wetland resistance to drowning. Among wetlands keeping pace with or exceeding RSLR, sediment accretion displays no significant relationship with elevation but rather appears controlled by both the rate of RSLR and relative sediment load, highlighting the importance of incorporating both factors into future studies of tidal saline wetlands. Carbon burial rates, controlled by sediment accretion, will likely increase with future accelerated sea level rise. Plain Language Summary Salt marshes and brackish scrub-shrub and forested tidal wetlands, collectively known as tidal saline wetlands, provide valuable services such as habitat for wildlife, protection from coastal flooding, and carbon sequestration. Despite their importance, tidal saline wetlands are threatened by sea level rise and scientists must better understand what controls their growth so as to make predictions of their future survival. Additionally, sediment accumulation within tidal saline wetlands is an important control on the amount of carbon sequestered in coastal areas; thus, understanding how these systems will evolve in the coming decades may shed light on the global carbon cycle and climate change. New results from the Oregon coast indicate that both the local pace of sea level rise and the amount of sediment delivered by rivers control tidal saline wetland growth. Because sea level rise is relatively slow in Oregon and Pacific Northwest rivers deliver relatively high amounts of sediment to the coast, Oregon tidal saline wetlands may be resistant to future drowning. However, of the seven estuaries studied, two showed evidence of drowning over the last century; the reasons for this are unclear but may relate to the local pace of sea level rise or other processes not accounted for in this study. Key Points Oregon tidal saline wetlands kept pace with twentieth-century sea level rise, except in the central coast, the reasons for which are unclear In estuaries with a positive accretionary balance, both sea level rise and sediment load relative to estuary area control accretion Blue carbon burial rates, provided herein, are the first such measurements for Oregon tidal saline wetlands	[Peck, Erin K.; Wheatcroft, Robert A.; Brophy, Laura S.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Brophy, Laura S.] Inst Appl Ecol, Corvallis, OR USA	Oregon State University	Peck, EK (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.	peckerin@oregonstate.edu		Peck, Erin/0000-0002-2021-6584	Oregon Sea Grant; Bonneville Power Administration; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board	Oregon Sea Grant; Bonneville Power Administration; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board	Digital data can be accessed through the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's Coastal Carbon Research Coordination Network (doi. org/10.25573/serc.11317820).

Investigating hydroclimatic impacts of the 168-158 BCE volcanic quartet and their relevance to the Nile River basin and Egyptian history	CLIMATE OF THE PAST			English	Article							LATE BRONZE-AGE; AFRICAN MONSOON; MOUNT-PINATUBO; MT-PINATUBO; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIXING STATE; ERUPTIONS; MODEL	The Ptolemaic era (305-30 BCE) is an important period of Ancient Egyptian history known for its material and scientific advances, but also intermittent political and social unrest in the form of (sometimes widespread) revolts against the Ptolemaic elites. While the role of environmental pressures has long been overlooked in this period of Egyptian history, ice-core-based volcanic histories have identified the period as experiencing multiple notable eruptions, and a repeated temporal association between explosive volcanism and revolt has recently been noted. Here we analyze the global and regional (Nile River basin) hydroclimatic response to a unique historical sequence of four large and closely timed volcanic eruptions (first a tropical one, followed by three extratropical northern hemispheric events) between 168 and 158 BCE, a particularly troubled period in Ptolemaic history for which we now provide a more detailed hydroclimatic context. The NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) ModelE2.1 Earth system model simulates a strong radiative response with a radiative forcing (top of atmosphere) of -7.5 W m(-2) (following the first eruption) and -2.5 W m(-2) (after each of the three remaining eruptions) at a global scale. Associated with this, we observe a global surface cooling of the order of 1.5 ? following the first (tropical) eruption, with the following three extratropical eruptions extending the cooling period for more than 15 years. Consequently, this series of eruptions is observed to constrain the northward migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon season, and major monsoon zones (African, South Asian, and East Asian) were seen to experience a suppression of rainfall of > 1 mm d(-1) during the monsoon (JJAS) season averaged for 2 years after each eruption. A substantial suppression of the Indian and North African summer monsoon (over the Nile River headwater region) was seen to strongly affect the modeled river flow in the catchment and discharge at river mouth. River mass flow over the basin was observed to decrease by 29 % and 38 % relative to an unperturbed (non-volcanic) annual mean flow in the first and second year, respectively, after the first (i.e., tropical) eruption. A moderate decrease ranging between 5 % and 18 % was observed after the third and fourth (extratropical) eruptions. These results indicate, in sum, that the first eruption likely produced a strong hydroclimate response, with the following extratropical eruptions prolonging this. These results also support the recently hypothesized association between ice-core-based signals of explosive volcanism and hydroclimatic variability during the Ptolemaic era, including the suppression of the agriculturally critical Nile summer flooding.

Isotopic signatures were used to quantify the contribution of snow to sea ice mass. These estimates yield a higher total snow contribution in MYI (10 +/- 5%) than to FYI (4 +/- 2%). Converted to Snow Depth Equivalent (SDE), MYI had five times larger SDE (0.79 +/- 0.38 m) than FYI (0.16 +/- 0.11 m). The difference is explained by the contribution of refrozen surface and under-ice melt ponds as well as superimposed/interposed ice for MYI resulting from higher accumulation of snow over multiple, longer accumulation seasons compared to FYI. Given the impending replacement of MYI by FYI, the large difference in absolute snow contributions between MYI and FYI highlights the potential implications in terms of the redistribution of precipitation-derived (meteoric) freshwater throughout the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, we observed high relative snow contributions to ice mass in the surface of one-third of older FYI cores, which we attributed to flooding and formation of snow-ice. Our results support the premise that flooding events on FYI may be more prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean than previously assumed. Plain Language Summary Snow is important for the Arctic energy balance, ongoing climate change, and the disappearance of the sea ice. Snow acts like a blanket on the ice keeping the sea ice warmer in the winter by preventing heat loss into the cold atmosphere above. While in summer, snow can also insulate the ice from warm air temperatures delaying the start of ice melt. Snow can also be incorporated into the ice and contribute to the Arctic sea ice mass balance. How much of the Arctic ice is made up of refrozen snow is largely unknown. Our results indicate that the older, multi-year ice has a larger snow contribution to ice mass than younger first-year ice. This difference arises as the older ice accumulates more snow-melt water into its mass each melt season, which means that when the older ice melts it releases freshwater, accumulated over several years, far away from where it picked it up. The younger Arctic sea ice releases snow it has accumulated already in the first summer closer to the snow fall location. As a result of the disappearing older sea ice, the distance snow-melt water is transported across the Arctic will likely decrease.

In the small islands of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), multiple stressors of environmental and socio-economic change interact and intensify at reduced spatial scales. Actors and institutions need to respond to these changes through responses - reactive or proactive actions planned or implemented by individuals, groups or organisations; aimed at responding to changing contexts and scenarios, by reducing, preventing and/or reverting the risks and impacts of environmental change. Through a mixed-method systematic review of academic literature from 2010 to 2020 using the Web of Science literature database, we document the types of responses, actors involved and elements of effective responses. We analysed 329 studies focusing on nine WIO small island states and territories (SISTs) - Zanzibar, Mafia, Seychelles, Comoros, Mayotte, La Re acute accent union, Mauritius, Maldives and Lakshadweep. Using quantitative content analysis, we organised information into categories ranging from institutional (economic instruments, laws, policies and community based), social (educational and informational), infrastructural (engineered and technological) and ecological restoration-based responses. The articles varied in their geographical distribution, focus and depth with regard to the responses studied. Diverse responses are documented, that often overlap across categories and may be combined and pursued simultaneously. For example, responses range from coastal protection structures, land reclamation, land elevation and artificial islands to mangrove restoration, awareness raising programs, coastal zone regulations and climate induced migration and relocation policies. Responses were predominantly institutional (85% of 329 articles, n = 281) - mainly driven by governments. The most common social responses (53%, n = 183) were linked to environmental education programs and knowledge sharing platforms. Although the responses indicated an increasing interest in ecological restoration (27%, n = 91) and community-based initiatives (36%, n = 120), they were largely underrepresented in research. Cataloguing the different responses may help incorporate the diversity into well-informed decisions, offer alternative ways of thinking and highlight specific areas and response types that should be the focus of future research and practice. The elements influencing the effectiveness of responses were identified through thematic synthesis - relevance to the local social-ecological context, resources available (time and funding), knowledge (access, diversity, integration, transfer, innovative and anticipatory), governance of responses (coordinated, transparent, adaptive, equitable, participatory and polycentric) and iterative monitoring. These elements of effectiveness tend to be synergistic and no single element is effective in isolation. When these elements are not considered, the response intervention could be maladaptive or counterproductive. Poorly designed responses result in perverse social and ecological outcomes, further increasing the exposure and vulnerability to the environmental stressors and decreasing public confidence and support. This review documents current literature, points to knowledge gaps and highlights the potential for islands to learn from each other and to further apply these lessons to non-island settings, critically considering the local context.

Here we use AMS C-14 dating and analyses of grain-size and major element contents, and the results show that: (1) During 11.5-10.0 cal kyr BP, the geochemical climate change index (C) (1.16), sediment accumulation rate (SAR) (0.007 cm/yr) and median particle diameter (Md) (20.6 mu m) are the lowest within the section, while the geochemical drought index (0.0323), Fe/Mn ratio (0.0088) and clay content (17.3%) are the highest, which indicate that the North China Plain received less precipitation, and chemical weathering and erosional intensity in the Ningjinpo paleolake catchment were weak. (2) During 10.0-7.7 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.36), content of sand (19.1%) and silt (68.0%), Md (27.2 mu m) and SAR (0.019 cm/yr) increase significantly. These characteristics indicate that the climate gradually became wetter, chemical weathering and erosion intensity increased, and there was increased runoff to the lake, which raised the lake level. (3) During 7.7-5.5 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.56), silt content (71.8%) and SAR (0.030 cm/yr) increase to the highest, while the Fe/Mn ratio (0.0068), sand content (14.4%) and Md (21.4 mu m) decrease to their lowest levels. These suggest the climate was warm and humid, the runoff to the lake was large, chemical weathering in the catchment was strong, and the water level of the lake reached the maximum for the Holocene. (4) During 5.5-3.3 cal kyr BP, the C index (1.26) and SAR (0.011 cm/yr) decrease substantially, whereas the sand content (28.2%) and M-d (18.3 mu m) increase to the highest levels. These characteristics demonstrate that the climate gradually became arid, the runoff to Ningjinpo paleolake was reduced, the intensity of chemical weathering and erosion in the catchment weakened, and the lake level decreased, although the high frequency of floods in this period. (5) In addition to the globally-recorded abrupt climatic events at similar to 8.2 cal kyr BP, similar to 5.3 cal kyr BP and similar to 4.2 cal kyr BP, which were recorded in the northern monsoon region of China, an abrupt climatic event in the middle Holocene, at similar to 7.2 cal kyr BP, was also recorded. In the northern monsoon region of China, these events may have been amplified by unusually active ENSO since the middle Holocene.

Asymmetric response of Amazon forest water and energy fluxes to wet and dry hydrological extremes reveals onset of a local drought-induced tipping point	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Amazonia; ecosystem-climate interactions; Eddy covariance; ENSO; tropical forests; water and energy flux seasonality	HEAT-FLUX; PHOTOSYNTHETIC SEASONALITY; BALANCE CLOSURE; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; CARBON; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; DEFORESTATION; EVAPORATION; MODEL	Understanding the effects of intensification of Amazon basin hydrological cycling-manifest as increasingly frequent floods and droughts-on water and energy cycles of tropical forests is essential to meeting the challenge of predicting ecosystem responses to climate change, including forest "tipping points". Here, we investigated the impacts of hydrological extremes on forest function using 12+ years of observations (between 2001-2020) of water and energy fluxes from eddy covariance, along with associated ecological dynamics from biometry, at the Tapajos National Forest. Measurements encompass the strong 2015-2016 El Nino drought and La Nina 2008-2009 wet events. We found that the forest responded strongly to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): Drought reduced water availability for evapotranspiration (ET) leading to large increases in sensible heat fluxes (H). Partitioning ET by an approach that assumes transpiration (T) is proportional to photosynthesis, we found that water stress-induced reductions in canopy conductance (Gs) drove T declines partly compensated by higher evaporation (E). By contrast, the abnormally wet La Nina period gave higher T and lower E, with little change in seasonal ET. Both El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events resulted in changes in forest structure, manifested as lower wet-season leaf area index. However, only during El Nino 2015-2016, we observed a breakdown in the strong meteorological control of transpiration fluxes (via energy availability and atmospheric demand) because of slowing vegetation functions (via shutdown of Gs and significant leaf shedding). Drought-reduced T and Gs, higher H and E, amplified by feedbacks with higher temperatures and vapor pressure deficits, signaled that forest function had crossed a threshold, from which it recovered slowly, with delay, post-drought. Identifying such tipping point onsets (beyond which future irreversible processes may occur) at local scale is crucial for predicting basin-scale threshold-crossing changes in forest energy and water cycling, leading to slow-down in forest function, potentially resulting in Amazon forests shifting into alternate degraded states. We studied tropical forest's response to hydrological extremes-2015-2016 El Nino drought and 2008-2009 La Nina wet events-at the K67 Tapajos National Forest, by analyzing 12+ years of micrometeorological and biometric data.imageDuring the wet La Nina, transpiration increased while evaporation decreased, with little change in seasonal water fluxes. Conversely, El Nino's drought led to the breakdown of the strong meteorological control over transpiration as vegetation functions slowed (leaf shedding increased and stomatal conductance shutdown). Reduced evapotranspiration resulted in higher sensible heat fluxes, amplified by feedback effects (higher temperatures and atmospheric demand). The forest crossed a threshold, recovering slowly post-drought.

The objective of this study was to determine the seasonally inundated hydroperiod for a floodplain section (28.66 km(2)) of the Upper Columbia River wetlands complex using time series satellite image observations and binary open water mask extraction. A mid pixel resolution (30 m) optical satellite image time series of 61 clear sky scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors were used to map temporal variations in floodplain open water wetland extent during the April to October hydrologically active season from 1984 to 2019 (35 years). The hydroperiod from the first 31 scenes (T1: 18 years) was compared to the second 30 (T2: 16 years) to identify changes in the permanent and seasonal open water bodies. The seasonal variation in open water extent and duration was similar across the two time periods but the permanent water body extent diminished by similar to 16% (or similar to 3.5% of the floodplain). A simple linear model (r(2) = 0.87) was established to predict floodplain open water extent as a function of river discharge downstream of the case study area. Four years of Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data from 1992 to 1995 (12 scenes) were examined to evaluate the feasibility of extending the hydroperiod record back to 1972 using lower resolution (60 m) archive data. While the MSS hydroperiod produced a similar pattern of open water area to duration to the TM/OLI hydroperiod, small open water features were omitted or expanded due to the lower resolution. While MSS could potentially extend the TM/OLI hydroperiod record, this was not performed as the loss of features like the river channel diminished its value for change detection purposes. Radarsat 2 scenes from 2015 to 2019 were examined to evaluate the feasibility of continued mountain valley hydroperiod monitoring using higher spatial and temporal resolution sensors like the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM). From the available horizontal transmit/receive (HH) single polarization sample set (8 scenes), the hydroperiod pattern of open water extent to duration was similar to the longer Landsat time series and possessed greater feature detail, but it was significantly reduced in seasonal inundation area due to the systematic omission of open water areas containing emergent vegetation. However, accepting that differences exist in sensor-based hydroperiod attributes, the higher temporal resolution of RCM will be suited to mountain floodplain inundation monitoring and open water hydroperiod analysis.

Strategies for coping and adapting to flooding and their determinants: A comparative study of cases from Namibia and Zambia	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management - Water Security, Sustainability and Development in Eastern and Africa Southern	OCT 26-28, 2016	Gaborone, BOTSWANA	WaterNet, WARFSA, GWPSA		Adaptation; Coping; Floods; Mwandi district; Rural households; Namibia; Zambia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; ZAMBEZI REGION; ADAPTATION; FARMERS; VULNERABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; LIVELIHOODS	It has been reported that flood events in Namibia and Zambia will increase, due to the variability and changes in the climate, thus increasing the number of people that are exposed to flooding disasters. This exposure will negatively impact the livelihoods of rural households if no interventions are implemented to strengthen the coping and adaptive capacity of the affected local population against flooding. The purpose of this case study was to determine the adaptation strategies that are adopted by rural households to floods in the eastern part of the Zambezi Region in Namibia and the Mwandi District in Zambia. The study further examined how socio-economic factors influence the choice of different adaptation strategies. The adaptation strategies were categorised into two groups, namely, short-term coping strategies and long-term adaptation strategies. Six focus group meetings were held and a questionnaire survey of 207 randomly-sampled households was conducted in the flood-prone areas of the study. In Namibia, the results indicated that the majority (96%) of the households coped with floods by gardening and sold poles, 74% sold firewood, 61% collected wild food and 59% received food aid during floods events. In Zambia, the major coping strategies included the sale of reeds and thatching grass (53%), firewood sales (51%), charcoal production and sales (51%) and wild food collection for sale (50%). With regard to the long-term adaptation strategies, the households in Namibia learnt to live with the floods; they engaged in the mafisa cattle trade (86%), they harvested the flood water (68%), changed the planting dates (63%), prayed (55%) and practiced conservation agriculture (54%) and fish farming (53%). In Zambia, the main long-term adaptation strategies were conservation agriculture (91%), the acquisition of preparedness skills (66%), the harvesting of flood water (63%), prayer (60%), and the practice of flood-proofing (52%). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the age, the land size, the length of stay in the flood plain, the duration of the floods, as well as their marital status, significantly influenced their choice of long-term adaptation strategies. Short-term strategies are heavily dependent on natural resources, which may put pressure on these resources. The study concludes that a variety of factors influence the choice of any specific adaptation strategy. For policy purposes, this suggests that the relevant stakeholder interventions should consider these determinants, in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of rural households to flooding. This study seeks to inform decision-makers and practitioners on how the disaster risks can be reduced and managed in the similar environments of the two countries, and to inform them of the status quo of flood adaptation.

Bistability of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf Cavity Circulation and Basal Melt	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf cavity; regional modeling; ice shelf melt; hysteresis; katabatic winds	CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; SEA CONTINENTAL-SHELF; WEDDELL SEA; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; BOTTOM WATER; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; COASTAL POLYNYAS; MODEL; ANTARCTICA; VARIABILITY	Circulation and water mass transformation within the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) cavity create precursors to Antarctic bottom water, which closes the global overturning circulation. This water mass transformation is contingent upon a relative low rate of FRIS basal melt, currently around 100-200Gt/yr. Previous studies have indicated that Antarctic climate changes may induce intrusions of warm modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) and an order-of-magnitude increase in basal melt, and signatures of mWDW have recently been observed along the face of the FRIS. However, it remains unclear how changes in near-Antarctic climate translate mechanistically to changes in mWDW access to the FRIS cavity. In this study a regional model is developed to investigate FRIS circulation dependence on local atmospheric state. Experiments with modified initial cavity conditions but identical atmospheric states yield bistable "warm" and "cold" FRIS cavity states, with an order-of-magnitude difference in basal melt rates. Idealized atmospheric perturbation experiments reveal that relatively modest perturbations to the katabatic winds shift the FRIS cavity between "warm" and "cold" states, which occur when the FRIS cavity is filled by mWDW or High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), respectively. The authors present a conceptual model in which the FRIS cavity state is determined by whether mWDW or HSSW is denser and thus floods the cavity; these states are bistable because the basal melt rate feeds back on the salinity of HSSW. These findings highlight a key role for the katabatic winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and other Antarctic ice shelves. Plain Language Summary The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) is Antarctica's largest floating glacier and is the source of the ocean's densest waters. Previous studies have predicted that warmer waters from offshore may flow beneath the FRIS in the future, elevating its melt rate and suppressing formation of dense waters. In this study, the controls on this warm water inflow are investigated using simulations of the southern Weddell Sea (WS), imposing various perturbations to the atmospheric winds and temperature. The ocean beneath the FRIS is found to be "bistable": Depending on its initial conditions, the ocean beneath the FRIS adjusts either to a "cold" state in which it is filled by waters originating from the WS continental shelf or to a "warm" state in which it is filled by waters originating from offshore. A switch between warm and cold states can be forced by changing the winds that blow northward over the FRIS; together with FRIS meltwater, these winds influence the density of cold waters formed on the WS continental shelf. These findings highlight a key role for offshore winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and indicate that existing dense waters beneath ice shelves may buffer against future intrusions of warm water.

Quantitative Flow-Ecology Relationships Using Distributed Lag Nonlinear Models: Large Floods in the Murray River Could Have Delayed Effects on Aquatic Macroinvertebrates Lasting More Than Three Decades	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						long-term monitoring data; ecohydrological relationships; hydrological indices; delayed effects of floods; allochthonous organic matter; woody debris	LARGE WOODY DEBRIS; LONG-TERM CHANGES; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; AGRICULTURAL STREAMS; FOREST-STREAM; RESTORATION; HABITAT; RECRUITMENT; DISTURBANCE	We aimed to quantify the delayed effects of flows on aquatic ecosystems using 33 years of monitoring data on macroinvertebrates and water quality and 51 years of hydrological data, spanning 2,300 km of the Murray River, Australia. By incorporating the delayed effects of hydrological indices, along with physicochemical variables, into generalized additive models to form distributed lag nonlinear models for macroinvertebrate richness and abundance, we found that the effects of floods on macroinvertebrates could last up to 32 years, depending on their magnitude. The models indicated that a large flood can cause an initial depression in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness, followed by a sustained increase persisting for over 25 years before returning to preflood levels. Twelve hydrological indices representing the magnitude of flow events were evaluated, with the q90/med (the 6-monthly flow exceeded 10% of time, divided by the long-term median) performing (slightly) better than other indices. Competing hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying the apparent long-term effect of floods were considered, with the most plausible explanation being the flood-mediated influx of allochthonous organic matter, especially coarse and large woody debris, that might drive the persistent change in the aquatic community. It is generally believed that macroinvertebrate communities recover quickly after floods, but our findings suggest that we may need to reconceptualize the effects that floods can have on aquatic macroinvertebrates and the communities they support, especially in the context of flow restoration and climate change. Plain Language Summary Research is being done around the world to understand how much water is required to sustain river ecosystems, and therefore, how much can be extracted for consumptive uses such as irrigated agriculture. We used long-term monitoring data (1980-2012) on aquatic macroinvertebrates-which includes insects, crustaceans, mussels, snails, and worms that spend all or part of their life in water-collected along 2,300 km of the Murray River, Australia, to investigate the relationship between river flow and the health of aquatic ecosystems. These data indicate that small to medium flows might have an immediate effect through improvements in water quality, but large floods may have sizeable delayed impacts on macroinvertebrates lasting more than three decades. The number of species and overall abundance of macroinvertebrates initially decreased, due to washout, but then increased for a period of about 25 years after the historic flood of 1993, persisting throughout the Millennium drought (1996-2010). The positive legacy of floods might be due to an influx of woody debris during the event, which can provide habitat and food for macroinvertebrates until decomposition of the woody material is complete.

J	Nguyen, TC; Schwarzer, K; Ricklefs, K				Nguyen, Thanh Cong; Schwarzer, Klaus; Ricklefs, Klaus			Water-level changes and subsidence rates along the Saigon-Dong Nai River Estuary and the East Sea coastline of the Mekong Delta	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Delta subsidence; Relative sea-level rise; Seasonal water-level fluctuation; Coastal inundation; Risk assessment; Tidal datum parameters	SOUTH CHINA SEA; SEDIMENT DYNAMICS; BENTRE PROVINCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISE; EVOLUTION; VIETNAM; IMPACT; CYCLE; DAMS	Southeast Asian deltas are highly threatened areas for flooding as a response to the combined effects of natural compaction and subsidence exacerbated by human impacts, e.g. oil, gas and water extraction, retention of sediment discharge due to river damming and sand mining, land use changes, sea-level rise and storm-induced water-level setup. Tide-induced water-level fluctuations on different time-and spatial scales, seasonal variations of freshwater runoff and sea-level setup can amplify the impact of sea-level rise and of storm surges on the coastal environment and its inhabitants. Moreover, increasing populations accompanied by growing societal demands can lead to further pressure on delta areas. For the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) and the Saigon-Dong Nai River (SGDNR), rates of subsidence of several cm/yr have already been determined, but for the coastal area, which is most vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surges, a lack of detailed spatial and temporal information of this parameter exists. To assess the influence of tide-and water-level fluctuations, records from 11 stations, from the tectonically stable position Vung Tau north of the SGDNR entry to Ganh Hao in the southern VMD, were analyzed. The results reveal a relative sea-level rise at Vung Tau reaching 2.2 +/- 0.3 mm/yr for the period from 1987 to 2015, while along the VMD those rates show a spatially variation from 5.6 +/- 0.3 mm/yr at Ben Trai to 13.5 +/- 0.7 mm/yr at My Thanh. Considering Vung Tau as tectonically stable, these numbers indicate subsidence rates of the coastal sections along the VMD ranging from 3.4 +/- 0.3 mm/yr to 11.3 +/- 0.7 mm/yr. It is likely that the rates of subsidence along the coast of VMD have accelerated since 2005. They are not only up to 4 times higher than the mean sea-level rise but are variable along the whole SGDNR estuary and the VMD East Sea coastline. Additionally, the importance of daily, fortnightly and seasonal water level fluctuations due to tides and atmospheric influence, which are acting on top of the long-term relative sea-level rise, is shown. Especially the identified regional variations make these data valuable for setting regional priorities for protection strategies to mitigate riverine and marine flooding, especially when both coincide.

Shifts in fish community composition and structure linked to seasonality in a tropical river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						asynchrony; benthic fish assemblages; diversity; seasonal; species abundance distributions	BETA DIVERSITY; SITE CONTRIBUTIONS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FLOODPLAIN LAKE; SILURIFORMES; ASSEMBLAGE; DEFORESTATION; MAINTENANCE; SIMILARITY; UNIQUENESS	The seasonality of tropical rivers, induced mainly by water level changes, shapes many interrelated aspects of ecological communities and the populations they contain, including animal movement, feeding, growth, and reproductive activity. However, the role played by seasonality in structuring the diversity of tropical assemblages is not yet fully understood. We examined the effects of seasonality on community structure and composition of benthic fish assemblages comparing two consecutive receding and rising water seasons in a major tributary of the Amazon basin. We quantified seasonal shifts in species abundance distributions and in composition using a multivariate dispersion test, total beta diversity and its decomposition into local (LCBD) and species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD). Additionally, we tested for relationships between LCBD values and richness, total abundance, and environmental variables. Many benthic fish species were rare in terms of numerical abundance. Rarity was most pronounced in the rising seasons, which had a higher proportion of singletons. A logseries was the best-fit model for both the receding and one of the rising season's species abundance distributions, while a lognormal was selected for the second rising season. We detected variation in species composition between seasons-the rising seasons were distinct from one another in terms of species composition, as well as differing from the receding seasons. LCBD showed strong negative relationships with species richness and total abundance, particularly in the rising seasons, indicating that seasons with high uniqueness in their composition also had low richness and abundance. LCBD was negatively correlated with temperature, while depth presented a positive relationship, as observed mainly in rising seasons with colder temperatures and greater water depth. Approximately one third of the species had higher than average SCBD values and were considered major contributors to beta diversity. These significant seasonal differences in both species relative abundances and assemblage composition might be explained by the asymmetrical spatial use of habitats during different seasons, strongly suggesting the importance of the flood-pulse cycle for maintaining diversity in this environment. Studies that seek to identify the species inhabiting a particular environment (e.g. bottom rivers habitats) and the factors that affect the dynamics, structure and composition of these communities are fundamental for future management and conservation. This is particularly urgent for understudied tropical freshwater ecosystems, as human pressures including anthropogenic climate change are expected to become increasingly severe. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns modify water temperature and flow regimes, thus affecting the hydrologic regime that determines the structure and dynamics of the ecological communities, with potential consequences for their integrity.

Rainwater, soil water and lateral discharge runoff in the soil-epikarst system were monitored using hydrometric and O-18 isotope methods in September 2020, which was the wettest month on record at the study s, including three normal rainfalls (29.6 mm in 8.5 h, 25 mm in 8.5 h, and 27.4 in 3.5 h) and three extreme rainstorms (335 mm in 11.5 h, 77.8 mm in 9 h, and 129.2 mm in 5 h). Soil moisture and water table responded rapidly (<30 min) during the extreme rainfall. However, the soil-epikarst interface exhibited the strongest stability (coefficient variation [CV] < 8.18%) and collected more pre-event water, reflected by the isotopic signature of the soil water. Accordingly, low permeability at the soil-epikarst interface played an important role in buffering rainwater infiltration. Controlled by infiltration-excess and saturation-excess runoff mechanisms, the contribution of surface runoff to total discharge was less than 3% during normal rainfall events, which was significantly less than that during extreme rainfall events (13%-60%). This was supported by the evolution of delta O-18 values of surface runoff that were similar to rainwater and more O-18-depleted than that of subsurface runoff. Higher rainfall intensity which exceeded soil permeability during extreme rainstorms further increased the possibility of exceeding infiltration-saturation processes. For the deep soil plot (DSP), surface runoff (>44%) dominated the extreme rainfall process; while for the shallow-soil plot (SSP), surface runoff (60%) dominated only during the maximum rainfall events. Moreover, the surface runoff contribution to total runoff in DSP was greater than that in SSP. Surface runoff from slopes with thicker soil layers is an important part of karst watershed flood processes in extreme rainfall events, which should be considered carefully for water resource management. Highlights Hydrometric and isotope methods are used to assess extreme hydrological processes. The surface runoff of extreme rainfalls is much higher than that of normal rainfall. The infiltration-excess mechanism dominates the surface runoff of extreme rainfall. Slopes with thicker soil layers are more vulnerable to flooding in the karst region.

In ephemeral channels, whose geomorphic response depends on the magnitude and frequency of hydrological events isolated in time, such relationships are often difficult to establish. This study sought to quantitatively relate morphological adjustments to stream power along different reference channel reaches for the period 2018-2020 in the Azohia Rambla, a Mediterranean gravel-bed ephemeral stream in southeastern Spain. Very high resolution digital terrain models (VHR DTM) (at 1 to 2.5 cm pixel size), combined with ortophotographs and 3D point clouds, generated via SfM photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for pre-and post-event stages, together with ground-based surveys were used to estimate the spatial variability of morphological sediment budgets and to assess channel bed mobility and changes in net sediment flux during the study period in two spatial scenarios: reference channel reaches (RCRs) and pilot bed survey areas (PBSAs). The hydraulic variables (flow velocity, Froude number, shear stress, mean stream power and energy gradient, among other) were estimated using a 1D hydrodynamic model calibrated with field information. The high resolution maps allowed a spatially-explicit analysis of stream power and transport efficiency in accordance with the areas of erosion and deposition in each RCR. The incision and bed armoring processes showed different trends according to the stream power (omega), cumulative excess energy (epsilon(c)), and relative bed stability (RBS). The greatest morphological adjustments at the event scale coincided with omega values above 300 W m-2, epsilon(c) higher than 3 MJ, and RBS below 0.5. The relationships between the mean stream power gradient at peak flood discharges and the changes in bed elevation verified the bed aggradation (an average surface raising of 0.17 to 0.22 m for delta omega/delta s of -6.2 to -14.5 W m(-2) m(-1)) during the major flood and bed scour (average surface lowering of 0.16 to 0.19 m for delta omega/ delta s of 5.8 to 10.6 W m(-2) m(-1)) in the moderated events at the bankfull and sub-bankfull stages. Furthermore, this study contributes new relevant data to the scarce existing literature on the relationships between stream power and morphosedimentary adjustments in a fluvial system highly sensitive and resilient to climate change, as is the case of ephemeral gravel-bed channels.

This requires a timely and adequate commitment to adaptation. In this paper, we show how adaptation needs to unfold over time to manage climate-induced SLR. We use a novel scenario-neutral approach, applied globally and subsequently combined with SLR and population scenarios, to assess when, where, and how fast to adapt up to 2150. As rates of SLR accelerate, adaptation needs to occur at an increasing pace or at a larger scale. While it is certain that adaptation will be necessary, it is uncertain when and how fast. After only similar to 0.15 m SLR relative to 2020, 1 million people need to adapt to permanent submergence and the amount of people at risk of a 100-year flood increases with 21% to 83 million people. This would occur in the next 30 (20-45) years for RCP4.5 and within 25 (18-36) years under RCP8.5, assuming no change in protection or population. The uncertainty in timing increases with higher SLR, albeit for some impacts it can still a matter of time. Population at risk of a 100-year flood doubles after 0.75 m SLR which could occur by similar to 2080 (2068-2088), 2100 (2085-2130), or 2150 (2115-beyond 2150) under a high-end, RCP8.5, or RCP4.5 scenario respectively. The rate, at which the risk increases, differs strongly per country. In some countries an additional 1-5 million people of the present population will be at risk of a 100-year flood within the next two decades, while others have more time to adapt but will see rapid growth of risk past 2100. Combining SLR impacts with projected population change further increases the number of people at risk of a 100-year flood by similar to 13% between 2040-2060 (under both RCP8.5-SSP5 and RCP4.5-SSP2). This can be managed through protecting, floodproofing or limiting developments in high-risk areas. A commitment to adaptation is inevitable to maintain risk at present levels. With increasing warnings of the potential for accelerated SLR due to rapid ice sheet melt, adaptation may need to happen faster and sooner than previously anticipated which can have consequences for how to adapt. Failure to acknowledge the potential and long-term (including beyond 2100) adaptation commitment in development and adaptation planning may lead to a commitment gap and subsequently expensive retrofitting of infrastructure, creation of stranded assets, and less time to adapt at greater cost. In contrast, considering the long-term adaptation commitment can support timely adaptation and alignment with other societal goals.

In Tanzania, this particularly concerns smallholder rain-fed production systems in the floodplains. After quantifying the existing yield gaps, key contributing factors need to be analyzed to improve site-specific management. Field experiments were conducted for three years and in three pedo-hydrological environments (fringe, middle, and center positions) of the Kilombero floodplain to evaluate: (1) The grain yield under farmers' management (actual yield), (2) yield with the best-recommended management (attainable yield), and (3) the non-limited yield simulated by the APSIM model (potential yield). In the field, we additionally assessed incremental effects of (1) field bunding and soil levelling, (2 and 3) additionally applying of 60 kg N ha(-1), as urea or as farmyard manure (FYM), and (4 and 5) incorporating in-situ-grown leguminous green manures. Attainable yields were determined with mineral N application at 120 kg ha(-1), additional PK fertilizer and supplemental irrigation. On average across years and positions, the potential, the attainable, and farmers' actual yields were 11.5, 8.5, and 2.8 t ha(-1)indicating a high total yield gap. About 16-38%, 11-20%, and 28-42% of this gap could be attributed to non-controllable yield-reducing (i.e., pest and diseases), yield-limiting (i.e., water and nutrient deficiencies), and yield-defining factors (i.e., poor soil and crop management), respectively. Results indicate a closure of the exploitable yield gap (differences between attainable and farmers' actual yields) by up to 6.5 t ha(-1)(nearly 60% of the potential yield). This exploitable yield gap was larger in 2016 than in 2017. Also, the gap was larger in the water-limited fringe and middle than in the frequently submerged center positions. Simple field bunds combined with land levelling could close 15-35% of the exploitable yield gap, depending on field positions and year. FYM or green manures were less effective than mineral N; however, in 2017 and in the wetter middle and center positions, they reduced the yield gap by >50%. We conclude that yield gaps in rainfed rice in Kilombero floodplain are large, but that a site- and system-specific adaptation of crop management can close much of the exploitable yield gap and increase grain yields by 0.7-4.8 t ha(-1). Similar benefits may be obtained in other hydrologically variable floodplain environments of the region and beyond.

Landscape, Soil, Lithology, Climate and Permafrost Control on Dissolved Carbon, Major and Trace Elements in the Ob River, Western Siberia	WATER			English	Article						river; forest; bog; permafrost; carbon; major ions; iron; colloids; trace element	IRON ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; ORGANIC-MATTER; BOREAL STREAMS; TRANSPORT; WATER; DYNAMICS; COLLOIDS; FLUXES; SEASONALITY; VARIABILITY	In order to foresee possible changes in the elementary composition of Arctic river waters, complex studies with extensive spatial coverage, including gradients in climate and landscape parameters, are needed. Here, we used the unique position of the Ob River, draining through the vast partially frozen peatlands of the western Siberia Lowland and encompassing a sizable gradient of climate, permafrost, vegetation, soils and Quaternary deposits, to assess a snap-shot (8-23 July 2016) concentration of all major and trace elements in the main stem (~3000 km transect from the Tom River confluence in the south to Salekhard in the north) and its 11 tributaries. During the studied period, corresponding to the end of the spring flood-summer baseflow, there was a systematic decrease, from the south to the north, of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Specific Conductivity, Ca and some labile trace elements (Mo, W and U). In contrast, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Fe, P, divalent metals (Mn, Ni, Cu, Co and Pb) and low mobile trace elements (Y, Nb, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf and Th) sizably increased their concentration northward. The observed latitudinal pattern in element concentrations can be explained by progressive disconnection of groundwaters from the main river and its tributaries due to a northward increase in the permafrost coverage. A northward increase in bog versus forest coverage and an increase in DOC and Fe export enhanced the mobilization of insoluble, low mobile elements which were present in organo-ferric colloids (1 kDa-0.45 mu m), as confirmed by an in-situ dialysis size fractionation procedure. The chemical composition of the sampled mainstream and tributaries demonstrated significant (p < 0.01) control of latitude of the sampling point; permafrost coverage; proportion of bogs, lakes and floodplain coverage and lacustrine and fluvio-glacial Quaternary deposits of the watershed. This impact was mostly pronounced on DOC, Fe, P, divalent metals (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Pb), Rb and low mobile lithogenic trace elements (Al, Ti, Cr, Y, Zr, Nb, REEs, Hf and Th). The pH and concentrations of soluble, highly mobile elements (DIC, SO4, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mo, Sb, W and U) positively correlated with the proportion of forest, loesses, eluvial, eolian, and fluvial Quaternary deposits on the watershed. Consistent with these correlations, a Principal Component Analysis demonstrated two main factors explaining the variability of major and trace element concentration in the Ob River main stem and tributaries. The DOC, Fe, divalent metals and trivalent and tetravalent trace elements were presumably controlled by a northward increase in permafrost, floodplain, bogs, lakes and lacustrine deposits on the watersheds. The DIC and labile alkaline-earth metals, oxyanions (Mo, Sb and W) and U were impacted by southward-dominating forest coverage, loesses and eluvial and fertile soils. Assuming that climate warming in the WSL will lead to a northward shift of the forest and permafrost boundaries, a "substituting space for time " approach predicts a future increase in the concentration of DIC and labile major and trace elements and a decrease of the transport of DOC and low soluble trace metals in the form of colloids in the main stem of the Ob River. Overall, seasonally-resolved transect studies of large riverine systems of western Siberia are needed to assess the hydrochemical response of this environmentally-important territory to on-going climate change.

The sealing of drainage basin surface leads to an increase of the runoff intensity, thereby decreasing the rainwater infiltration. This situation can lead to the risk of flooding in urban areas. Therefore, especially in great cities there is a need for application of such solutions that will support the operation of the sewage systems. The examples of such solutions are, among others, the green roofs. The paper presents the results of investigation of the water retention capacity of 4 green roof models containing following growing media: (1) the typical green roof substrate without any amendments, (2) the substrate with addition of about 1 % by weight of hydrogel (the cross-linked potassium polyacrylate), (3) the substrate containing about 0.25 % by weight of hydrogel, (4) the substrate with addition of expanded clay and perlite. The models were not vegetated in order to investigate only the water retention capacity of drainage elements and substrates. The water retention capacity of green roof models was investigated in the laboratory conditions with use of artificial precipitations simulated after diverse antecedent dry weather periods (ADWP) amounting to: 1, 2, 5, 7, and 12 days. The intensities of artificial precipitations were relatively high and ranged from 1.14 to 1.27 mm/min, whereas their durations ranged from 7.75 to 12.56 min. These values of intensities and durations corresponded to the design rainfall intensities calculated using Blaszczyk's equation for annual rain depth equal to 600 mm and the return periods ranged from 5 to 15 years. The obtained results indicate that the water retention capacity of green roof models, expressed as the volumes (or depths) of rainwater retained within their structures, increases with an increase of ADWP. Results indicate that the relation between ADWP and the amount of water retained in the layers of green roofs in the case of relatively short antecedent dry weather periods provided for the analysis (from 1 to 7 days) may be approximately linear. The results of the one-way ANOVA indicate that in the case of all models there is a statistically significant difference between the values of retention depth for specified ADWP (p < 0.001). During more than half of simulated precipitations, especially in the case of longer ADWPs lasting 5, 7, and 12 days the best water retention capacity had Model 3, with substrate containing about 0.25 % by weight of hydrogel. On the other hand, the results show that the weakest retention capacity had Model 2 (with substrate containing 1 % by weight of hydrogel). In the case of longer ADWPs (lasting 7 and 12 days) relatively weak water retention capacity had Model 4 (with substrate containing the addition of expanded clay and perlite). It can be concluded that too large amount of hydrogel added to the substrate can have an unfavourable impact on the water retention capacity of green roofs.

Catchments in the boreal-temperate transition zone may be especially vulnerable to these factors. We developed a new approach to peak flow analysis using two long-term, paired catchment experiments in that landscape at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in north-central Minnesota. We investigated how forest cover change affects the magnitude, occurrence probability, event decoupling, and seasonal decoupling of annual maximum peak flows. Event decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in response to different events within a given year. Seasonal decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in different seasons within a given year. Commonly used statistical methods (e.g., ANCOVA) support inferences only for effects on peak flow magnitude, disregarding effects on event occurrence probability. Statistical stationarity (i.e., time-invariant parameters) is generally assumed within the ANCOVA analysis, despite temporal changes in climatic and land cover controls. Further, use of these methods requires event coupling, which is not always valid for annual maximum flows in catchments with mixed precipitation regimes. To address these limitations, we developed new nonstationary flood-frequency analysis methods with Bayesian parameter estimation to analyze two harvesting experiments, including conversion from deciduous to coniferous species. We compared results from these models to traditional least-squares based methods (e.g., ANCOVA). We assessed event and seasonal decoupling using logistic regression with Bayesian parameter estimation. There was no effect of harvesting on the annual maximum flow according to ANCOVA and generalized least squares models, but these methods were not reliable due to the presence of outliers, and both event and seasonal decoupling. Flood-frequency results from one clearcutting experiment showed increases in the annual maximum flow across nearly all return intervals, with 80-85% confidence for peak discharges between the 10 and 50-year peak flow. The 50-year return interval peak increased from an expected 17 cfs to 34 cfs after harvest. Harvesting induced substantial event decoupling in the catchment pairs, and seasonal decoupling in one catchment pair. As forest cover regenerated, decoupling probability decreased. Our coupling analysis results indicated that control and treatment catchments generated and processed flood peaks differently after harvest, and explained the poor fit of the linear models for which we assumed event coupling. Our study calls into question several key assumptions of traditional linear models in the analysis of paired-catchments given certain conditions. For example, where forest harvesting can affect the season of annual maximum peaks, and thus the phase of the generating precipitation event (snowmelt versus rainfall), it changes the relationship between the catchment pair in a way not accounted for in traditional linear models. We advocate the use of probabilistic methods that can incorporate nonstationarity and are robust to different mechanisms of catchment hydrologic change in response to forest harvest.

Climate models predict that such conditions will intensify in the future, impacting millions of people. Paleo-climate studies can complement the short modern observational record and model projections by documenting climate changes in the past. Here we report major shifts in the geographic sources, intensity, and seasonality of Eastern Mediterranean precipitation during the unusually warm last interglacial period Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, reflecting global shifts in the rain and desert belts, based on U-234/U-238-ratios , 238 U-ratios in mineral precipitates in the Dead Sea, combined with evidence from climate model simulations. In the Dead Sea catchment U-234/U-238 ratios are indicators of water sources, where the Jordan River (flowing from the north) and the western catchments show high activity ratios between similar to 1.5-1.7, and the eastern and southern catchments and flash floods (in the south-west, south and east) show lower ratios of 1.0-1.2. In Dead Sea water and precipitated minerals, U-234/U-238 is nearly always similar to 1.45-1.55 during both glacials and interglacials. However, during the last interglacial MIS 5e insolation peak (similar to 127 -122 ka) its value decreased to 1.2-1.3, and then to similar to 1.0 towards its end (similar to 122-116 ka). During the insolation peak, the U-isotope data, combined with climate model runs forced with period orbital and greenhouse gas concentrations, indicate that rainfall associated with the African Summer Monsoon in the Dead Sea catchment accounted for similar to 50% of the total annual rainfall, in stark contrast to present-day dry summers. The geochemical evidence indicates that following the insolation peak the region experienced an extremely dry period (although punctuated with wetter intervals), signifying expansion of the desert belt, similar to predicted effects of anthropogenic warming. This drying is partly supported by climate model runs forced with the appropriate changes in orbital parameters. The extreme drying during late MIS Se between similar to 122-116 ka reflected a major weakening of Mediterranean storm systems, resulting in a major decline of the Jordan River flow (indicated by the low U-234/U-238 ratios in the Dead Sea) and a relative increase in precipitation associated with the African Monsoon, shifting towards autumn. The Jordan River flow is estimated to be similar to 10% of the present-day (pre-1964, prior to major diversion of the Jordan River and its sources for human use). Such changes, if they occur in the future, have serious implications for future water availability in the politically sensitive Middle East. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the oldest, best preserved and most complete sub-provinces of the CAMP is located in Morocco. Geochemical, geochronologic, petrographic and magnetostratigraphic data obtained in previous studies allowed identification of four strato-chemical magmatic units, i.e. the Lower, Intermediate, Upper and Recurrent units. For this study, we completed a detailed sampling of the CAMP in Morocco, from the Anti Atlas in the south to the Meseta in the north. We provide a complete mineralogical, petrologic (major and trace elements on whole-rocks and minerals), geochronologic (40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb ages) and geochemical set of data (including Sr-Nd-Pb-Os isotope systematics) for basaltic and basaltic-andesitic lava flow piles and for their presumed feeder dykes and sills. Combined with field observations, these data suggest a very rapid (<0.3Ma) emplacement of over 95% of the preserved magmatic rocks. In particular, new and previously published data for the Lower to Upper unit samples yielded indistinguishable 40Ar/39Ar (mean age = 201.2 +/- 0.8 Ma) and U-Pb ages (201.57 +/- 0.04 Ma), suggesting emplacement coincident with the main phase of the end-Triassic biotic turnover (c.201.5 to 201.3 Ma). Eruptions are suggested to have been pulsed with rates in excess of 10 km(3)/year during five main volcanic pulses, each pulse possibly lasting only a few centuries. Such high eruption rates reinforce the likelihood that CAMP magmatism triggered the end-Triassic climate change and mass extinction. Only the Recurrent unitmay have been younger but by no more than 1Ma. Whole-rock and mineral geochemistry constrain the petrogenesis of the CAMP basalts. The Moroccan magmas evolved in mid-crustal reservoirs (7-20 km deep) where most of the differentiation occurred. However, a previous stage of crystallization probably occurred at even greater depths. The four units cannot be linked by closed-system fractional crystallization processes, but require distinct parentalmagmas and/or distinct crustal assimilation processes. EC-AFC modeling shows that limited crustal assimilation (maximum c.5-8% assimilation of e.g. Eburnean or Pan-African granites) could explain some, but not all the observed geochemical variations. Intermediate unit magmas are apparently the most contaminated and may have been derived from parental magmas similar to the Upper basalts (as attested by indistinguishable trace element contents in the augites analysed for these units). Chemical differences between Central High Atlas and Middle Atlas samples in the Intermediate unit could be explained by distinct crustal contaminants (lower crustal rocks or Pan-African granites for the former and Eburnean granites for the latter). The CAMP units in Morocco are likely derived from 5-10% melting of enriched peridotite sources. The differences observed in REE ratios for the four units are attributed to variations in both source mineralogy and melting degree. In particular, the Lower basalts require a garnet peridotite source, while the Upper basalts were probably formed from a shallower melting region straddling the garnet-spinel transition. Recurrent basalts instead are relatively shallow-level melts generated mainly from spinel peridotites.

This definition encapsulates both the terrestrial surface expression and the geological focus on the entire sediment mass. Environmental studies also focus on the ecology of deltaic wetlands, their drowning history, and related sustainability issues including societal considerations, history, and culture. A mean 76 +/- 16% drop in hydraulic energy occurs in all subaerial deltas regardless of size, given the break in gradients separating fluvial and deltaic surfaces, driving an ever-decreasing bed-material transport, shallowing of distributary channels and concomitant overbank flooding. A delta's sediment mass grows from the addition of new river loads but can also include aeolian and marine sediment derived from outside the delta domain, growth of peat and other biomass, and inputs from human action. Removal of sediment is via river plumes interacting with marine currents, wave-induced transport, sediment failures and gravity flows, high-tide inundation onto the delta plain, tidal channel widening and deepening, and human action (peat, clay, sand and gravel mining). A delta's trapping efficiency ranges from 0 for small-load rivers that discharge directly into an energetic ocean, to 80% for large deltas, and up to 100% for some semi-enclosed bayhead deltas, including fjords. The global (ensemble) subaerial delta aggradation rate is-1.6 mm/y if 70% of the global sediment load exits the river mouth(s), a reminder of how much sediment can be expected to be delivered to the surfaces of global deltas at a time when the 2022 CE sea level rise is-4 mm/y. At the planetary scale, deltas are environmentally complex given Earth's range in climate, hydrodynamics, tectonic settings, relative sea-level provinces, sediment input, redistribution processes, and human actions. Under natural conditions, the subaerial portion of deltas adapt to change by advancing, retreating, switching, aggrading, and/or drowning, whereas many modern deltas are structurally constrained by societal needs. The 89 large and mud-rich coastal marine deltas (i.e. subaerial area > 1000 km2) account for 84.3% of Earth's total deltaic area that hosts > 89% of all humans occupying deltas, many living within megacities. The 885 medium -size deltas (i.e. subaerial areas 10-1000 km2) account for 15.5% of the global delta area and 10.5% of humans living on deltas, with characteristics that fall between the small and large delta categories. The 1460 small and essentially sandy deltas (1-10 km2), including all fjord deltas, are impacted less from human action (with ex-ceptions) and most are better able to withstand climate change. Recognizing the limits of big data in capturing delta complexity, field data remains a necessary gold standard for site investigators.

The detrital signatures of these eolian sediments were previously investigated based on either framework petrography and heavy minerals or detrital-zircon geochronology, and their peculiar volcaniclastic nature was long recognized. Compositional variability, however, was only broadly evaluated, and quantitative provenance analysis based on a systematic multimethod approach across the entire region was not carried out so far. For this reason, here we integrate original and previously obtained petrographic, heavy-mineral, and detrital-zircon geochronology data to present the first comprehensive provenance study of dune fields stretching for 1000 km across central Argentina from the Andean piedmont to the Atlantic Ocean. In dune fields along the Andean retroarc basin, sediment composition defines a steady northward decrease in volcanic detritus. This reflects active magmatism in the Southern Volcanic Zone and Payenia province (38-34S), in contrast with the similar to 600-km-long Pliocene-Quaternary magmatic gap in the Pampean flat-slab segment (33-27S), where sediment is derived from deeper-seated tectono-stratigraphic levels of the continental arc and uplifted blocks of retroarc-basin basement. In distal Pampean lowlands extending across the bulge and backbulge depozones, instead, sand dunes display notably homogeneous compositional signatures, indicating that detritus was mostly generated north of 34S and transported by a paleo-Desaguadero trunk river that formed during southward-progressing diachronous uplift of the Sierras Pampeanas since the late Miocene. In contrast with huge African and Arabian deserts that contain multiply recycled quartzose to pure quartzose sand, even very fragile volcanic clasts, plagioclase feldspar, and unstable ferromagnesian minerals are widespread, testifying to largely first-cycle volcanic provenance and only minor effects of mechanical breakdown and chemical weathering in the Pampean Sand Sea. During the Late Pleistocene, after a first southward shift of the Desaguadero trunk river possibly induced by increased water and sediment discharge at the end of the penultimate glacial maximum, tectonic uplift eventually outpaced stream power during the last glacial period. Paleo-rivers were thus forced to shift farther southwards, leading to the formation of an integrated paleo-Desaguadero+Colorado drainage system. During the latest Pleistocene-early Holocene, such a large trunk river fostered the rapid progradation of a wide delta and littoral sand transport all along the shores of the Buenos Aires Province. Climate change and repeated waxing and waning of glaciers through the Quaternary have left a prominent mark on sediment distribution, dominated by fluvial processes during periods of high fluvial discharge but alternating with arid phases characterized by limited transport capacity and vegetation cover, extensive wind deflation of floodplains, and sand accumulation in the dune fields.

Sea Level Rise Driving Increasingly Predictable Coastal Inundation in Sydney, Australia	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						coastal inundation; sea level rise; climate change; risk; impacts; adaptation	FREQUENCY; EXTREME; IMPACT; ACCELERATION; CHALLENGE; RESPONSES	As global mean sea level continues to rise, thresholds corresponding to coastal inundation impacts are exceeded more frequently. This paper aims to relate sea level rise (SLR) observations and projections to their physical on-the-ground impacts. Using a large coastal city as an example, we show that in Sydney, Australia, frequencies of minor coastal inundation have increased from 1.6 to 7.8 days per year between 1914 and present day. We attribute over 80% of the observed coastal inundation events between 1970 and 2015 to the predominantly anthropogenic increases in global mean sea level. Further, we find that impact-producing coastal inundation will occur weekly by 2050 under high- and medium-emission/SLR scenarios and daily by 2100 under high emissions. The proportion of tide-only coastal inundation events (i.e., where no storm surge is required to exceed flood thresholds) will increase with SLR, such that most coastal inundation events, including those considered historically severe, will become a predictable consequence of SLR and astronomical tides. These findings are important for coastal managers as frequency, severity, and predictability of inundation impacts can all now be related to the amount of SLR (e.g., a planning allowance or SLR projection). By incorporating known historical inundation events, this allows contextualization, visualization, and localization of global SLR and the changing nature of future coastal inundation risk. Plain Language Summary As sea levels rise, the daily highest tide reaches higher and further inland, and as a result, we see coastal flooding more frequently. Coastal flooding is when roads, carparks, walking paths, gardens, and, in more extreme cases, homes and businesses are impacted by high sea levels. Using Sydney, Australia, as an example, we find that most coastal flooding events we observe today would not have happened without human-caused sea level rise. Further, coastal flooding is expected to occur in Sydney on average once per week by 2050 and every day by 2100 if high greenhouse gas emissions continue. In the past, the most severe coastal flooding impacts, such as flooding of main roads and private property, only occurred with large coastal storm events. However, we find that these severe floods will occur much more frequently as sea levels continue to rise, as they will eventually occur on the daily high tides. As the timing and heights of daily high tides are driven by the Sun, Moon, and the seasons, these severe coastal floods will become very predictable. This will have implications for the coastal and emergency managers tasked to deal with this changing risk. Key Points We quantify the roles that tides and increasing mean sea level have on coastal inundation in Sydney, Australia Future exceedances of current impact thresholds will be mainly tide driven, with minimal role for ocean, weather, and climate variability We develop a framework for generating projections of the frequency and severity of coastal inundation impacts, to inform adaptation	[Hague, Ben S.; Murphy, Bradley F.; Jones, David A.] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hague, Ben S.; McGregor, Shayne; Reef, Ruth; Jones, David A.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia	Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Monash University	Hague, B (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.; Hague, B (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia.	ben.hague@bom.gov.au	McGregor, Shayne/A-9059-2013	Hague, Ben/0000-0002-4931-8111; McGregor, Shayne/0000-0003-3222-7042; Jones, David Arfon/0000-0001-9868-0013	Australian Research Council [DP180103444]	Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)	S.

However, the net role of soil erosion in the global C cycle is still unclear as it involves small-scale SOC removal, transport, and redeposition processes that can only be addressed over selected small regions with complex models and measurements. This leads to uncertainties in future projections of SOC stocks and complicates the evaluation of strategies to mitigate climate change through increased SOC sequestration. In this study we present the parsimonious process-based Carbon Erosion DYNAMics model (CE-DYNAM) that links sediment dynamics resulting from water erosion with the C cycle along a cascade of hillslopes, floodplains, and rivers. The model simulates horizontal soil and C transfers triggered by erosion across landscapes and the resulting changes in land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes at a resolution of about 8 km at the catchment scale. CE-DYNAM is the result of the coupling of a previously developed coarse-resolution sediment budget model and the ecosystem C cycle and erosion removal model derived from the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model. CE-DYNAM is driven by spatially explicit historical land use change, climate forcing, and global atmospheric CO2 concentrations, affecting ecosystem productivity, erosion rates, and residence times of sediment and C in deposition sites. The main features of CE-DYNAM are (1) the spatially explicit simulation of sediment and C fluxes linking hillslopes and floodplains, (2) the relatively low number of parameters that allow for running the model at large spatial scales and over long timescales, and (3) its compatibility with global land surface models, thereby providing opportunities to study the effect of soil erosion under global changes. We present the model structure, concepts, limitations, and evaluation at the scale of the Rhine catchment for the period 1850-2005 CE (Common Era). Model results are validated against independent estimates of gross and net soil and C erosion rates and the spatial variability of SOC stocks from high-resolution modeling studies and observational datasets. We show that despite local differences, the resulting soil and C erosion rates, as well as SOC stocks from CE-DYNAM, are comparable to high-resolution estimates and observations at subbasin level. We find that soil erosion mobilized around 66 +/- 28 Tg (10(12) g) of C under changing climate and land use over the non-Alpine region of the Rhine catchment over the entire period, assuming that the erosion loop of the C cycle was nearly steady state by 1850. This caused a net C sink equal to 2.1 %-2.7 % of the net primary productivity of the non-Alpine region over 1850-2005 CE. This sink is a result of the dynamic replacement of C on eroding sites that increases in this period due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations enhancing the litter C input to the soil from primary production.

J	Roy, B; Baidya, D; Jain, V				Roy, Biswajit; Baidya, Disha; Jain, Vikrant			Hydrogeomorphic Response of Charcoals During River Transits and Its Impact on the Carbon Cycle	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						pyrogenic carbon; wildfire; carbon fluxes; Himalaya; transient floodplains; Indo-Gangetic region	YAMUNA RIVER; BLACK CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST-FIRE; MICROSCOPIC CHARCOAL; FLOODPLAIN EVOLUTION; SEDIMENTARY RECORDS; GANGETIC PLAINS; ORGANIC-CARBON; PARTICLE-SIZE	Natural or anthropogenic-induced biomass burning produces large amounts of charcoals, which enter riverine or lacustrine systems mostly via surface runoff processes. Charcoal storage and cycling within large riverine systems can play a crucial role in mediating long-term carbon sink across transient reservoirs, thereby influencing the global carbon budget. However, natural processes governing the transport and storage of charcoal particles in large terrestrial reservoirs such as the Indo-Gangetic region still remain unknown. To understand charcoal movement and accumulation across upland and lowland transient reservoirs, we characterized spatial distribution and morphology of different charcoal forms (>125 mu m and <125 mu m) from bedload and floodplain sediments of the Yamuna sub-basin (YSB), India. Both >125 mu m and <125 mu m charcoal forms in bedload and floodplain sediments did not exhibit similar spatial distribution patterns, indicating the segregation of charcoal particles influenced by variable flow regimes. Attrition with sediments breaks down fragile charcoals (leaves) quickly compared to the woody forms, resulting in dominant woody microforms in transient deposits. Higher stream power and limited stable bedform development in upland mountainous regions restrict charcoal storage. During lowland riverine transits, reduced stream power conditions allow increased floodwater inundation and finer clay substrate availability, facilitating an exponential increase in charcoal storage. However, increased discharge from peninsular rivers into the YSB leads to erosion and redistribution of sediment, including charcoal particles, and reduced charcoal storage in lowland transient areas. Such diverse dispersal pathways and fate of charcoal particles across riverine transits highlight the influence of regional hydrogeomorphic processes on the overall carbon cycle within transient reservoirs. Plain Language Summary Rivers and wind carry a lot of charcoal, which comes from burned plants, to temporary storage places. Rivers play an essential role in charcoal distribution across mountain and lowland regions before it ends up to the ocean. Impact of river in charcoal movement is an important component of nature that helps in the recycling of carbon globally and this process still remains poorly understood. This study attempts to understand the natural response of charcoal particles across the Yamuna River (India) and its tributaries. It is observed that the river flow influences the spatial distribution of smaller charcoals (<125 mu m) more than bigger (>125 mu m) charcoal. Higher river flow provided less time to settle charcoals in the mountain areas, allowing limited charcoal accumulation. In lowland areas, charcoal tends to gather where there is more sand and dirt piling up. But when lots of water rushes in from rivers, it can wash away the charcoal, making it harder for charcoals to stay in one place. Such responses of charcoal particles to complex river actions, such as sediment types, river flow, and landscape, impact the storage of charcoal particles and can contribute to variation in the carbon recycling across Earth surface.

EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						sea-level trend; Venice; Atlantic multidecadal variability; decadal climate prediction; teleconnections	REGIONAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUTURE; PROJECTIONS; OSCILLATION; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; REANALYSIS; EVOLUTION; MODELS; TRENDS	Sea-level rise is one of the most critical consequences of global warming, with potentially vast impacts on coastal environments and societies. Sea-level changes are spatially and temporally heterogeneous on multiannual-to-multidecadal timescales. Here, we demonstrate that the observed rate of winter sea-level rise in the Italian city of Venice contains significant multidecadal fluctuations, including interdecadal periods of near-zero trend. Previous literature established a connection between the local sea-level trend in Venice and over the broad subpolar and eastern North Atlantic. We demonstrate that for multidecadal variations in sea-level trend such connection holds only since the mid-20th Century. Such multidecadal sea-level fluctuations relate to North Atlantic sea-surface temperature changes described by the Atlantic multidecadal variability, or AMV. The link is explained by combined effect of AMV-linked steric variations in the North Atlantic propagating in the Mediterranean Sea, and large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic with a local effect on sea level in Venice. We discuss the implications of such variability for near-term predictability of winter sea-level changes in Venice. Combining available sea-level projections for Venice with a scenario of imminent AMV cooling yields a slowdown in the rate of sea-level rise in Venice, with the possibility of mean values remaining even roughly constant in the next two decades as AMV effects contrast the expected long-term sea-level rise. Acknowledging, understanding, and communicating this multidecadal variability in local sea-level rise is crucial for management and protection of this world-class historical site. Plain Language Summary Environmental and socioeconomic impacts of sea-level rise are one of the major concerns of global warming. Here, we consider the case of the Italian city of Venice, one of the iconic locations for the potentially dramatic effects of sea-level rise. We show that the sea-level evolution in Venice during the past similar to 150 years contains strong multidecadal fluctuations, so that periods of more than two decades when there is little or no trend occurred even in the recent past. We link these fluctuations with sea-level and climatic variations in the North Atlantic. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon known as Atlantic multidecadal variability, or AMV, which describes the alternation over multidecadal periods of warm and cold phases of the North Atlantic surface. Our results indicate that warm AMV phases are linked to faster sea-level rise in Venice and vice versa. Accordingly, we build sea-level rise scenarios for Venice until 2035 by considering an imminent AMV cooling as suggested by recent studies. The scenarios yield a temporary slowdown of sea-level rise as the AMV contrasts the effects of global warming. This sea-level variability can strongly impact on the management of protective measures against flooding currently operative in Venice.

J	Poschlod, B				Poschlod, Benjamin			Using high-resolution regional climate models to estimate return levels of daily extreme precipitation over Bavaria	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; INTERNAL VARIABILITY; VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RAINFALL; SIMULATIONS; CONVECTION; ENSEMBLE; EVENTS; GENERATION	Extreme daily rainfall is an important trigger for floods in Bavaria. The dimensioning of water management structures as well as building codes is based on observational rainfall return levels. In this study, three high -resolution regional climate models (RCMs) are employed to produce 10- and 100 -year daily rainfall return levels and their performance is evaluated by comparison to observational return levels. The study area is governed by different types of precipitation (stratiform, orographic, convectional) and a complex terrain, with convective precipitation also contributing to daily rainfall levels. The Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5 (CRCM5) at a 12 km spatial resolution and the Weather and Forecasting Research (WRF) model at a 5 km resolution both driven by ERA -Interim reanalysis data use parametrization schemes to simulate convection. WRF at a 1.5 km resolution driven by ERAS reanalysis data explicitly resolves convectional processes. Applying the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, the CRCM5 setup can reproduce the observational 10 -year return levels with an areal average bias of +6.6 % and a spatial Spearman rank correlation of p = 0.72. The higher-resolution 5 km WRF setup is found to improve the performance in terms of bias (+4.7 %) and spatial correlation (p = 0.82). However, the finer topographic details of the WRF-ERAS return levels cannot be evaluated with the observation data because their spatial resolution is too low. Hence, this comparison shows no further improvement in the spatial correlation (p = 0.82) but a small improvement in the bias (2.7 %) compared to the 5 km resolution setup. Uncertainties due to extreme value theory are explored by employing three further approaches. Applied to the WRFERAS data, the GEV distributions with a fixed shape param- eter (bias is +2.5 %; p = 0.79) and the generalized Pareto (GP) distributions (bias is +2.9 %; p = 0.81) show almost equivalent results for the 10 -year return period, whereas the metastatistical extreme value (MEV) distribution leads to a slight underestimation (bias is 7.8 %; p = 0.84). For the 100 -year return level, however, the MEV distribution (bias is +2.7 %; p = 0.73) outperforms the GEV distribution (bias is +13.3 %; p = 0.66), the GEV distribution with fixed shape parameter (bias is +12.9 %; p = 0.70), and the GP distribution (bias is +11.9 %; p = 0.63). Hence, for applications where the return period is extrapolated, the MEV framework is recommended. From these results, it follows that high-resolution regional climate models are suitable for generating spatially homogeneous rainfall return level products. In regions with a sparse rain gauge density or low spatial representativeness of the stations due to complex topography, RCMs can support the observational data. Further, RCMs driven by global climate models with emission scenarios can project climate -changeinduced alterations in rainfall return levels at regional to local scales. This can allow adjustment of structural design and, therefore, adaption to future precipitation conditions.

Monsoon controls on sediment generation and transport: Mass budget and provenance constraints from the Indus River catchment, delta and submarine fan over tectonic and multimillennial timescales	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Review						Monsoon; Indus; Erosion; Himalaya; Transport	PB GEOCHRONOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; EARLY PALEOZOIC TECTONISM; SOUTH ASIAN MONSOON; MAIN CENTRAL THRUST; WESTERN HIMALAYA; LATE QUATERNARY; TIBETAN PLATEAU; LADAKH HIMALAYA; LATE PLEISTOCENE; LESSER HIMALAYA	How well do deep-sea sedimentary archives track erosion in upland sources, driven by climatic change or tectonic forcing? Located on the western edge of South Asian monsoon influence, the Indus River system is particularly sensitive to variations in monsoon rainfall and thus provides a unique opportunity to estimate the nature of sedimentary signal propagation (i.e., recognizable pulses of sediment) through a large river basin under different climatic conditions. In this review we examine the impact that changing monsoon rainfall has had on NW Himalayan landscapes and its foreland since the middle Miocene. Rates of erosion are linked to summer monsoon rains over tectonic timescales but patterns of erosion are more explicitly linked to tectonically-driven rock uplift. Positive feedback between rock uplift and orographic precipitation drives increased erosion and transport from the Lesser Himalaya since the Miocene. After 2 Ma, erosion increasingly shifts to the Inner Lesser Himalaya. As defined multiproxy evidence, strong monsoon rainfall intervals broadly result in increased erosion and faster sediment transport together with increased chemical weathering, although the latter is further linked with global temperature and to the magnitude of sediment recycling within the routing system. We estimate that during the Holocene, most sediment (67-89% of the total -6000 km3 or 16.3 x 1012 t) delivered to the ocean was sourced either from direct bedrock erosion through channel incision linked to higher discharge or from remobilized, recycled glacial sediment initially deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Post-LGM sediment is primarily stored within the delta plain and shelf clinoform systems. Over the last 14 kyr, average mass delivery rates (936-1404 Mt/y) are much higher than pre-damming estimates (pre-1940s; 250-300 Mt/y). To reconcile observations with pre-damming estimates, high sediment supply rates, probably during strong monsoon intervals over the early Holocene, are required. Long-term rates were high (182-273 Mt/y) during a middle Miocene strong monsoon interval. Quaternary Indus submarine fan sedimentation is limited to sea-level lowstands, at which times shelf and delta sediment is eroded and reworked into deep water. As a result, and for at least the past 2-3 m.y., most sediment delivered to the Indus submarine fan was initially eroded from bedrock during strong summer monsoon intervals but deposited into the fan under weak monsoon intervals. During the most recent sea level lowstand, only -24% of sediment deposited in the fan was derived from synchronous onshore bedrock erosion, with the remaining accounted for by recycled terrace, floodplain, and shelf clinoform system sediment. Variations in monsoon intensity over the last glacial cycle strongly impact the locus of onshore erosion, with increased relative Himalayan bedrock erosion during times of strong, wet monsoon intervals and increased Karakoram bedrock erosion during drier glacial intervals.

Here, we document the high-frequency provenance variations and different sediment delivery models recorded in the late Triassic Zhuoni fan developed in the northeastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean, mainly based on process-based sedimentological and provenance study of the Panyuan section in the West Qinling area in the northeastern margin of Tibetan Plateau. High-, low-density turbidites, hybrid event beds and hyperpycnites are distributed in the lobe-dominated submarine fan succession. Field sedimentological evidence from surrounding outcrops suggests that shelf-edge failure was the main cause of most high- and low-density turbidites with the overall absence of submarine slides or slumps, whereas the narrow shelf configuration together with late Triassic humid pulses is favourable for the occurrence of flood-related hyperpycnites in the Zhuoni fan. Detrital zircon grains (N = 6; n = 123-272) generally have Palaeozoic-Mesozoic ages (ca. 350-250 Ma and 500-400 Ma) and Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic ages (ca. 2100-1750 Ma and 2600-2400 Ma), but they can be further categized into three age groups due to different proportions of Precambrian age populations. The results demonstrate that the potential source areas may include the South and North Qinling Orogenic Belt, Qilian Orogenic Belt, different segments of North China Craton and the tectonic junction area between the Qinling and Qilian Orogenic Belts. The temporal changes in provenance signals, which are reflected by both the detrital zircon age spectra and heavy mineral assemblages, indicate different contributions of those sources in response to sea-level fluctuation. It could thus give rise to temporal variations between reactive and buffered source-to-sink sediment delivery models of the Zhuoni fan, despite the overall narrow shelf configuration. The development of the lowstand Zhuoni fan was directly related to extrabasinal hyperpycnal delivery from the river mouth and its high-frequency provenance variability recorded different efficiencies of signal transfer through the onshore catchment with significantly influence of temporal storage, fluvial rejuvenation or even regional climate variability. The highstand submarine fan was thought to be formed by shelf-edge failure with sediment buffering in the shelf region, which was associated with a strong magnitude of provenance mixing. Our work provides a new perspective for deciphering the different origins of deep-water sediment delivery in response to high-frequency sea-level and climate changes. Schematic models illustrating different source-to-sink signal propagation patterns, provenance mixing, and formation mechanisms of the late Triassic Zhuoni fan in response to high-frequency sea-level fluctuations and monsoon-induced climate variability. image	[Tan, Mingxuan; Sun, Haonan; Fu, Yilin; Cui, Haonan] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Cui, Haonan] China Geol Survey, Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengcheng] China Geol Survey, Nanjing Ctr, Nanjing, Peoples R China	Hohai University; China Geological Survey; Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology (QIMG); China Geological Survey; Nanjing Center, China Geological Survey	Tan, MX (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.	mxtan@hhu.edu.cn			Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42372118, 42002117]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200529];  [2019B06314];  [B220202047]	Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); ; 	This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42372118, 42002117), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20200529) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2019B06314, B220202047).

Identifying Robust Changes of Extreme Precipitation in Japan From Large Ensemble 5-km-Grid Regional Experiments for 4K Warming Scenario	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						global warming; large ensemble experiments; high-resolution dynamical downscaling; regional climate model; extreme precipitation	HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT; CLIMATE MODEL; JULY 2018; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; FUTURE ENHANCEMENT; TYPHOON; RESOLUTION; PROJECTION; IMPACTS; AREAS	To evaluate the impacts of global warming on local-scale extreme precipitation in Japan, 720-year ensemble dynamical downscaling is conducted by a regional climate model with a 5 km grid spacing. Our dynamical downscaling is based on the large ensemble data set called the database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change (d4PDF). Comparing the historical and 4K warming climates, the annual maximum daily and hourly precipitation are enhanced over Japan due to global warming. The increasing rate of annual maximum daily precipitation is larger over the coast of the Pacific Ocean in eastern and western Japan and the northern parts of Japan. The periods in which the extreme daily precipitation increases in each region depend on the movement of the Baiu front and the number of typhoons from June through September. The 50-year return value of the maximum 24-hr land precipitation within 500 km of the typhoon center is 960 mm/24hr in the 5 km experiment. This value is larger by 1.87 times than that of the 20 km experiment. The rate of future increase in the 50-year return value related to typhoons is 1.30 relative to the present values for the 5 km experiments. The local-scale quasi-stationary band-shaped precipitation system, which is called senjo-kousuitai in Japanese, sometimes brings local-scale heavy precipitation to Japan. The senjo-kousuitai is well reproduced in the 5 km experiments and shows increases in frequency and intensity under the 4K warming condition. This study also discusses the application of our 5 km experiments to hydrological fields. Annual maximum daily and hourly precipitation extremes are enhanced due to warming over the whole of Japan, while their increasing rates are different in each region. The months of the largest increase in extreme precipitation depend on the region and correspond to the movement of the Baiu front and the number of typhoons hitting each region in Japan. Local-scale quasi-stationary band-shaped precipitation systems, which sometimes bring extremely heavy precipitation to Japan, are well reproduced in the 5 km experiments and show increases in frequency and intensity under the 4K warming condition. The major river basins in the western parts of the Japanese island, Kyushu, would be influenced by global warming more than other river basins in Japan, indicating that the risk of flooding would increase. In all of Japan, large ensemble experiments with 5 km grid spacing enable us to evaluate future changes in extreme precipitationExtreme precipitation can be enhanced in all of Japan due to global warming, while the rate of increase depends on the region and monthIn the rainy season in Japan, 10-day precipitation will decrease, while infrequent extreme hourly and daily precipitation will increase	[Kawase, H.; Nosaka, M.; Watanabe, S.

Coupling groundwater with surface water observations from Sentinel-2 data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate surface water connectivity with local aquifers following intense precipitation events in arid basins. Surface water area and groundwater level data were analyzed for trends following precipitation, including peak lag time, post-peak recession rates, and changes in hydraulic gradients. Results indicate variable connectivity following large precipitation events between surface water change and groundwater level fluctuations in the upgradient freshwater aquifer, whereas the downgradient brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer indicated virtually no connectivity with the aquifer. Comparison between precipitation and surface water response indicate distinct responses based on the physical relationship of the surface water body with the brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer. Lumped parameter modeling of surface water inundation also constrains the possible hydrologic dynamics of the post-precipitation response. While modeled influx to surface water seems primarily controlled by watershed hydraulics rather than direct hydraulic connectivity of the aquifers, the relationship between surface water and adjacent groundwater levels coupled with surface water area indicates that local aquifers are primarily connected to the surface water bodies through discharge via subsurface infiltration. Modeling results imply that the existence of brine-adjacent surface water in arid basins relies on upgradient discharge from freshwater aquifers. Our results further support that marginal surface water systems can serve as a critical recharge mechanism to local aquifers.Plain Language Summary Surface water is important for desert ecosystems, but the future of surface water remains uncertain because of climate change and human consumption. Understanding how surface water responds to precipitation and interacts with groundwater is useful for better predicting future water availability. Advancements in the quality of satellite imagery provide an opportunity to combine satellite data with rain gauge and water level data to investigate the connection of surface water to rainfall patterns and groundwater. Observations from flooding behavior show two different types of surface water. Both types can be categorized by proximity to the brine that exists in the aquifer underlying the basin floor: transitional pools occur at the edge of the transition to brine while terminal lagoon systems occur in the brackish groundwater zone. Calculations indicate that the two groups have different inflow and outflow mechanisms that occur over varying timescales. These mechanisms indicate that intense rainfall events will lead to increased inundation over longer periods of time for transitional surface water bodies. However, despite rapid rates of recession, terminal pools will also experience prolonged inundation above background levels for up to a year after large rainfall events because of increased spring discharge from rainfall-driven recharge to groundwater.

Over the last decades, various geochemical signals and proxy records, including delta C-13, pCO(2), iridium and other platinum-group elements, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), charcoal and SO2, have been directly or indirectly attributed to CAMP magmatism. Here, we compile these various records in a stratigraphic framework to present a cohesive chain of events for the CAMP and the end-Triassic mass extinction. Mercury and iridium anomalies in sediments indicate that CAMP activity commenced prior to the onset of the marine extinctions (as marked by the last occurrence of the Triassic ammonoid Choristoceras marshi or closely related species), and a negative delta C-13 excursion in organic matter (the Marshi CIE). This CIE may be explained by input of light carbon to the atmosphere from CAMP lavas of the Tiourjdal and Prevalent groups. Pedogenic carbonate below and above the Prevalent group in North America indicates a more than twofold increase in atmospheric pCO(2). Subsequent n-alkane C-isotopes, and stomatal pCO(2) data seem to indicate a temporary cooling after the Marshi CIE, which is consistent with climate models incorporating volcanic emissions of both CO2 and SO2. Records of excess iridium and Hg/TOC indicate intensified magmatism during the extinction interval. Tectonic and perhaps epeirogenic (i.e. doming due to rise of magma) activity is suggested by the occurrence of multiple and widespread seismites in Europe. Atmospheric pCO(2) proxies indicate global warming, which culminated contemporaneously with the Spelae CIE. Global warming is corroborated by increased wildfire activity testified by charcoal and pyrolytic PAH records. Increased isotopic ratios of Os and Sr from sections that record global ocean signatures suggest increased weathering of continental crust likely due to climatic changes. Just prior to the increase in pCO(2) from stomatal proxy data, fossil plants exhibit SO2-induced damage indicating excess sulfur dioxide deposition priot to and across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. At the same time, increased ratios of heavy molecular PAHs (coronene/benzo(a)pyrene) in sediments suggest metamorphism of organic sediments also occurred across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. These proxies may suggest that thermogenic release of light carbon and sulfur from sill intrusions in the Trans-Amazonian basins, where both evaporate- and organic-rich sediments are known to have been intruded, may have played an important role during the course of the ETME. Geochemical traces of magmatism, i.e. Ir and Hg, appear to have gradually disappeared during the Hettangian, suggesting that later phases of CAMP were less voluminous. Stomatal proxy data from Greenland and n-alkane C-isotope data from the UK, together with oxygen isotope data from carbonate fossils in the UK, may indicate that the global warming at the Spelae CIE was succeeded by another short-term cooling event. A gradual decrease in delta C-13 culminated at the top-Tilmanni CIE, marking the beginning of a long-term steady state with more negative C-isotope values than prior to the ETME. At this time, terrestrial ecosystems appear to have stabilized globally and ammonoids had begun to rediversify.

Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether signatures in tropical mesotidal estuary sediments of Qua Iboe River, Gulf of Guinea	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						GDGTs; Gulf of Guinea; Organic Matter; Estuary; Sediments; Monsoon rains; Tropical temperature; Lipid biomarkers	TERRESTRIAL ORGANIC-MATTER; SOUTH CHINA SEA; MEMBRANE-LIPID DISTRIBUTIONS; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; EARLY DIAGENESIS; ETHER LIPIDS; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; BIOMARKER EVIDENCE; ARCHAEAL LIPIDS	The continuous supply of land derived organic carbon by rivers is significant to the ocean carbon cycle. In river-estuary systems, the composition and distribution of sedimentary organic matter (OM) can provide detailed information on the balance of land-derived inputs and in situ productivity. This insight is significant for an improved understanding of anthropogenic activity and the changing climate. In the Gulf of Guinea (GoG), high rainfall, coupled with flooding and a warmer climate have direct impacts on OM distributions. Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) have been used extensively to investigate OM. In this study, we focused on the widespread occurrence of isoprenoid GDGTs (isoGDGTs), branched GDGTs (brGDGTs), H-tetraethers (H-isoGDGTs and H-brGDGTs), hydroxyl GDGTs (OH-GDGTs), isoGDGT isomers, methylated isoGDGTs (Me-GDGTs), butanetriol and pentanetriol tetraethers (BDGTs and PDGTs), in short sediment cores collected from the inner and outer Qua Iboe River Estuary, located in the GoG. We further determined total organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen (TN), long chain hydrocarbons (LCA; C-27-C-33 n-alkanes), dinosterol, brassicasterol and phytol, to estimate OM sources, flooding activity, OM degradation, to reconstruct pH and to determine past tropical temperatures. The distribution patterns of GDGTs, use of principal component analysis (PCA), heatmap hierar-chical cluster analysis, correlation models, the ratios of isoGDGTs/brGDGTs, ring index (RI), brGDGT-IIIa/IIa, branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT), Corg/TN and terrestrial-marine biomarker ratio (TMBR) were all sensitive for indicating terrestrial vs marine OM contributions to the total OM of the tropical estuarine sediments. Marine OM persisted from subsurface to bottom sediment layers (8-38 cm) in the outer estuary site, while a mixed OM source was observed in inner estuary sediments. The Cren/Cren' ratio >58.5 (up to 83.8), pointed to a predominance of Thaumarchaeota group I.1a microbes. The Methane Index (MI) and isoGDGT-0/Cren ratio indicated significant imprints of a non-methanotrophic archaeal community. A positive linearity of total BDGTs and PDGTs plotted against MI and isoGDGT-0/Cren suggested that these compounds are produced by the same group of the non-methanogenic archaeal community in this tropical estuary. Thus, Methanomassiliicoccus lumi-nyensis is not the only source of BDGTs and PDGTs in the marine environment. Further, the calculated CBT5me derived pH reflected in situ measured sediment pH (6.3). TEX86H-derived sea surface temperature (SST), within error, reflected water column temperature. Calculated brGDGT mean annual air temperatures (MAATs) reflected average annual atmospheric temperatures. Ring index OH-GDGTs temperature proxies (RI-OH SSTsummer and RI-OH SST) reflected mean dry season (November to February) temperatures. A newly derived MAAT proxy, calculated from H-brGDGT, also reflected the tropical annual air temperature (23-28 degrees C). Altogether, as ex-pected, the OM sources are traced largely to both terrestrial and marine inputs. The terrestrial OM was deposited by excess flooding and surface runoff occasioned by torrential monsoon rains in recent years, triggered by climate change, while mesotidal currents introduced marine OM into the Qua Iboe River Estuary system. This study further contributes to our understanding of OM distributions in warmer climate conditions.

J	Kaiser, T; Ahlborn, J				Kaiser, Thomas; Ahlborn, Julian			Long-term vegetation monitoring in the floodplain grasslands of the lower Havel Valley (northeastern Germany) and conclusions for sustainable management practices	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Restoration; Biodiversity; Nature conservation; Red list; Extensification	PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; RIPARIAN WETLANDS; RESTORATION; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; CONSTRAINTS; DIVERSITY; PERSIST	As a result of water regulation measures and the subsequent introduction of intensive use practices, riverine floodplains have suffered severe habitat and species losses. With the changed economic conditions and decrease in animal stocking rates after 1990, opportunities arose for the partial restoration of species-rich vegetation areas in East Germany. Sixty permanent plots were established in the lower Havel Valley in the federal state of Brandenburg from 1993 to 1999. We studied the effects of extensification and partial rewetting in this area during a monitoring programme that lasted until 2018. For this purpose, groundwater levels, historical land use, and soil chemical parameters were investigated, and the soil seed bank and phytosociological releve ' s were sampled. Previous research has shown that an extended period of intensive grassland use eliminates the possibility of success in short- to medium-term natural restoration because of the lack of suitable propagules. Our question was as follows: how does a floodplain grassland respond to extensification and decreased water regulation in an area that experienced a shorter period of intensification in the past, such as the lower Havel floodplain? Tests of soil samples showed a depleted soil seed bank at the beginning of the monitoring period, but the seed bank was less depleted than those in other areas. Using cluster analysis followed by discriminant analysis, we identified water regime parameters and historical land-use intensity as the main drivers of vegetation differentiation. The classification resulted in the differentiation of vegetation into 13 plant communities. Plant communities were combined into 5 main groups based on their location in the ordination diagram of a detrended correspondence analysis. The shift in group centroids over time correlated with increases in the species diversity and moisture level for all groups. The altered species composition as a result of the changed water regime after 1990 influenced the usability of the grassland differently depending on the relief level. At the end of monitoring, vegetation at sites in the mesic moisture range was determined to have the highest fodder quality observed in this study. With increasing mean groundwater levels, the forage quality of the vegetation decreased until it was so low that the vegetation was hardly suitable for use as animal forage. The plant species diversity was negatively correlated with the plant-available P and Ellenberg N indicator value. Plant-available P, K and Mg showed evidence of leaching during the later study period. The abundance of red-listed species and extensive-use indicator species increased over the course of the study period. This positive trend was reversed by the extreme flood event in the summer of 2013. However, the high species richness and the species compositions of the reference communities were not equal in the other communities, even after almost 30 years of extensification. This finding underlines the importance of the few remaining meadows that are rich in typical floodplain species as donor areas of autochthonous seeds. The results of this study are discussed in light of sustainable management practices and global climate change.

However, their impacts on people's life have not attracted enough attention from scholars. In this study, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) describing the drought/flood situation and the Composite Index of Human Well-being (CIHW) are calculated, and a framework is further constructed to assess the impacts of drought and flood disasters on human well-being in the DRB. The results show that the annual and seasonal SPI in the DRB generally exhibit an increasing trend in fluctuations during 2000-2009, indicating a wetting climate in this basin. Overall, the upper reaches of the DRB have experienced an evolution of flood-drought-flood state transition, where the variation amplitude of the SPI in the western sub-basin is greater than that in the eastern sub-basin. In addition, the lower reaches of the DRB have suffered more dramatic and periodic changes from the drought/flood disasters in terms of the SPI. For human well-being during 2000-2019, Maerkang City in the upper reaches, Kangding City in the middle reaches, and Shimian County in the lower reaches of the DRB are at a relatively higher level, with the CIHW decreasing from administrative centers to the around. Moreover, the CIHW over the whole basin increases gradually from 2000 to 2019. The SPI has significantly negative effects on different capitals, following a descending order of financial, social, physical, human and natural capitals. The counties of the basin are divided into four groups, namely the group with high disaster risks and high human well-being, the group with high disaster risks and low human well-being, the group with low disaster risks and high human well-being, and the group with low disaster risks and low human well-being. The panel regression results suggest that the construction of water conservancy facilities, the financial inputs in agriculture and meteorology, and the educational level have positive impacts on human well-being, but the impacts differ from different groups. The construction of water conservancy facilities has highly significant impacts on human well-being in all groups; the education level has no significant impact on the group with high disaster risk and high human well-being, which has not passed the significance test; while the financial inputs in agriculture and meteorology have relatively higher impacts on the whole basin and on the group with low disaster risk and low human well-being compared with other groups. Therefore, it is suggested that the negative impacts of drought and flood disasters can be mitigated through strengthening infrastructure construction, responding appropriately to climate change, avoiding disasters at the source of major projects and improving the disaster prevention and mitigation systems.

Due to climate changes, the frequency of glacial hazards such as glacial lake outbursts floods is increasing, and consequently, the mass of Iran's glaciers is decreasing. Fieldwork in high-altitude mountains is difficult, thus, the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers and their associated driving factors are poorly studied. In this study, changes in the elevation and the surface flow speed of the largest and most dynamic debris-covered glacier in Iran (Alamkouh glacier) are evaluated during 2018 to 2020 for the first time. For this purpose, images froma high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are used. Additionally, the spatial distribution of glacier ice thickness is estimated based on the principles of ice-flowand glacier surface velocity data. The distribution of ice thickness is evaluatedwith in-situ Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) data. The acquired high-resolution images fromUAV are processed into a digital elevationmodel (with a spatial resolution of about 15 cm) and orthoimages (with a spatial resolution of about 8 cm), and glacier ice thickness change and surface flow velocity are derived. In order to estimate glacier surface velocity, a frequency cross-correlation model was applied using the COSI-Corr module. Our results show that the mean glacier ice thinning during the study period 2018-2020 is about -0.23 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1) and it reaches about -5 +/- 0.65 m yr(-1) at the terminus and accumulation areas. The observed variations in ice thinning are best explained by the existence of debris cover (and their corresponding insulating effects), the existence of ice cliffs, and their associated supraglacial lakes. We found that ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than average. Moreover, the mean surface velocity of Alamkouh glacier is about 1.1 +/- 0.06m yr(-1) from 2018 to 2020 with considerable spatial variation in surface velocities. Themaximumsurface velocity (about 4.5 +/- 0.27m yr(-1)) belongs to its upper regions, and lower andmarginal areas are nearly stagnant. The slowmovement of the glacier, alongwith a continuous increase in debris and ice thinning, provides a suitable condition for supraglacial pond development, which decreases glacier mass. Total volume of glacier was estimated to be similar to 102 x 10(6) m(3) in 2020, corresponding to an average ice thickness of similar to 31.3 +/- 7.5 m. Moreover, the average ice thinning rate is 0.66% yr(-1) in 2018 to 2020. According to this reduction rate, it is expected that more than 51.7% of the glacier will be lost by the end of the 21st century. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Increasing marsh bird abundance in coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, 2011-2021, likely caused by increasing water levels	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						abundance; climate change; coastal; Great Lakes; marsh-breeding bird; trend; water level; wetland; abondance; changements climatiques; cotier; Grands Lacs; oiseau de marais; tendance; niveau d'eau; zone humide	LAND-COVER CHANGE; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CATTAIL INVASION; LEAST BITTERNS; SPATIAL MODEL; MUTE SWANS; ONTARIO; LANDSCAPE; TRENDS	Wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America (i.e., lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) provide critical habitat for marsh birds. We used 11 years (2011-2021) of data collected by the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program at 1,962 point-count locations in 792 wetlands to quantify the first-ever annual abundance indices and trends of 18 marsh-breeding bird species in coastal wetlands throughout the entire Great Lakes. Nine species (50%) increased by 8-37% per year across all of the Great Lakes combined, whereas none decreased. Twelve species (67%) increased by 5-50% per year in at least 1 of the 5 Great Lakes, whereas only 3 species (17%) decreased by 2-10% per year in at least 1 of the lakes. There were more positive trends among lakes and species (n = 34, 48%) than negative trends (n = 5, 7%). These large increases are welcomed because most of the species are of conservation concern in the Great Lakes. Trends were likely caused by long-term, cyclical fluctuations in Great Lakes water levels. Lake levels increased over most of the study, which inundated vegetation and increased open water-vegetation interspersion and open water extent, all of which are known to positively influence abundance of most of the increasing species and negatively influence abundance of all of the decreasing species. Coastal wetlands may be more important for marsh birds than once thought if they provide high-lake-level-induced population pulses for species of conservation concern. Coastal wetland protection and restoration are of utmost importance to safeguard this process. Future climate projections show increases in lake levels over the coming decades, which will cause "coastal squeeze" of many wetlands if they are unable to migrate landward fast enough to keep pace. If this happens, less habitat will be available to support periodic pulses in marsh bird abundance, which appear to be important for regional population dynamics. Actions that allow landward migration of coastal wetlands during increasing lake levels by removing or preventing barriers to movement, such as shoreline hardening, will be useful for maintaining marsh bird breeding habitat in the Great Lakes. center dot We calculated the first-ever abundance estimates for 18 marsh-breeding bird species over 11 years (2011-2021) in coastal wetlands throughout all of the North American Great Lakes.center dot Abundance of 9 (50%) species increased by large amounts, but none decreased, which is welcomed because the abundance of most species was already low.center dot Increases were likely caused by rising water levels, which created high-quality marsh bird habitat consisting of patches of wet, standing vegetation (such as cattails) interspersed with pools of open water.center dot Coastal wetlands may provide critical, periodic boosts to regional populations of marsh birds during rising water levels, but this may be threatened in the future because extremely high-water levels due to climate change could cause reductions in marsh bird habitat due to flooding.center dot Protection and restoration of coastal wetlands and actions that allow landward migration of coastal wetlands by removing or preventing barriers to movement will be needed. Les zones humides des Grands Lacs laurentiens d'Amerique du Nord (c.-a-d. les lacs Superieur, Michigan, Huron, erie et Ontario) constituent un habitat essentiel pour les oiseaux de marais. Nous avons utilise 11 ans (2011-2021) de donnees recueillies par le Programme de surveillance des zones humides cotieres des Grands Lacs a 1 962 points d'ecoute dans 792 zones humides pour quantifier les tout premiers indices annuels d'abondance et les tendances chez 18 especes d'oiseaux de marais dans les zones humides cotieres de l'ensemble des Grands Lacs. Neuf especes (50 %) ont augmente de 8 a 37 % par annee dans l'ensemble des Grands Lacs, tandis qu'aucune n'a diminue. Douze especes (67 %) ont augmente de 5 a 50 % par annee dans au moins un des cinq Grands Lacs, alors que seulement trois especes (17 %) ont diminue de 2 a 10 % par annee dans au moins un des lacs. Il y avait plus de tendances positives parmi les lacs et les especes (n = 34, 48 %) que de tendances negatives (n = 5, 7 %). Ces fortes augmentations sont les bienvenues car la plupart des especes sont preoccupantes sur le plan de la conservation dans les Grands Lacs. Les tendances ont probablement ete causees par des fluctuations cycliques a long terme des niveaux d'eau des Grands Lacs. Le niveau des lacs a augmente pendant la majeure partie de l'etude, ce qui a inonde la vegetation et augmente la juxtaposition de l'eau libre et de la vegetation, ainsi que l'etendue de l'eau libre, qui sont reconnus pour influencer positivement l'abondance de la plupart des especes en augmentation et d'influencer negativement l'abondance de toutes les especes en diminution. Les zones humides cotieres peuvent etre plus importantes pour les oiseaux de marais qu'on ne le pensait auparavant si elles fournissent des impulsions demographiques induites par le niveau eleve des lacs pour les especes dont la conservation est preoccupante. La protection et la restauration des zones humides cotieres sont d'une importance capitale pour preserver ce processus. Les projections climatiques futures indiquent une augmentation des niveaux d'eau au cours des prochaines decennies, ce qui entrainera une << compression cotiere >> de plusieurs zones humides si elles ne sont pas en mesure de migrer vers l'interieur des terres assez rapidement pour suivre le rythme. Dans ce cas, il y aura moins d'habitat disponible pour soutenir les pulsations periodiques de l'abondance des oiseaux de marais, qui semblent importantes pour la dynamique des populations regionales. Les mesures qui permettent la migration vers l'interieur des terres des zones humides cotieres lorsque le niveau des lacs augmente, en eliminant ou en empechant la formation d'obstacles au mouvement, comme le durcissement des rives, seront utiles pour maintenir l'habitat de reproduction des oiseaux de marais dans les Grands Lacs.

Contemporary changes of the channel pattern and braided gravel-bed floodplain under rapid small valley glacier recession (Scott River catchment, Spitsbergen)	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Proglacial river system; Intramarginal outwash plain; Braided river floodplain; Multiple-channel river patterns; Svalbard	PROGLACIAL RIVERS; BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; SEDIMENT FLUXES; SVALBARD; PERIOD; CONNECTIVITY; VARIABILITY; RUNOFF; RATES	After the Little Ice Age, high-latitude proglacial river catchments have been observed to transition to paraglacial conditions through the activation of fluvial processes and changes in the river valley and channel forms. This project provides an analysis of contemporary changes in the morphology of the valley bottom and channel development of the proglacial Scott River catchment (NW part of the Wedel Jarlsberg Land, SW Spitsbergen) based on observations conducted during the 2009-2013 melt seasons. Almost half of the catchment (area of 10 km(2)) is occupied by a valley glacier, currently in the stage of rapid recession. The processes driving the development of the glacier-free valley floor are determined by (1) long-term factors such as geological structure, glaciotectonics, or the morphogenesis of the terminoglacial zone; (2) medium-term factors, including climatic changes and changes in the extent of the glacial terminus and hydrological regime; and (3) short-term factors such as weather-driven flooding events. Geological factors determined the development of two valley narrowings, and a clear division of the valley floor into three morphological zones. The upper gorge in the terminal moraine rampart distinguishes the wide (up to 700 m) upper section of the valley bottom dominated by an outwash plain, where the river system is fed by small tributaries. The lower valley gorge dissecting the elevated marine terrace separates the middle section of the braided river floodplain from the mouth section (alluvial fan). The geomorphological field mapping of the valley floor and riverbed was conducted using geodesic and hydrometric measurements with high-resolution survey techniques based on the global positioning system (GPS). The detail measurements of the Scott River valley and channel were carried out at representative cross-sections and longitudinal profiles in various parts of the catchment. Because of the dominance of the glacial alimentation regime, changes in the discharge rate and bedload transport regime are influenced by the glacial ablation rate, which determines the variability of channel morphology and the contemporary development of the valley bottom. The upper section of the valley is dominated by a multiple-channel braided system fed by sub- and supraglacial waters, while in the middle section the development pattern changes from a meandering single-thread channel to a multiple-channel wandering system to a multiple-channel braided system. The current valley bottom is almost entirely occupied by a braided river floodplain and multiple-channel river bed. Changes in the channel system are related to periods of snowmelt and the related flooding. After the retreat of the snow cover, the channels are highly stable, as their spatial pattern is usually transformed during several days of ablation or ablation-precipitation flood flows. In the river's mouth section, the channel returns to a single-thread meandering pattern before transitioning to a multiple-channel distribution system and finally to a single-thread straight channel. The river below the ebb in the storm bank develops a subaqual prodelta. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Current research on the association between flood exposure and diarrhea risk is limited mainly to short-term and event-specific analyses. Moreover, how prior drought or water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) practices influence this association remains largely unknown.ObjectiveTo examine the association between flood exposure and diarrhea risk among children younger than 5 years and to evaluate the compounding influence of prior drought and effect modification by WaSH.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study included multicluster surveys conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys Program in 43 low- and middle-income countries during 2009 through 2019. This study included children younger than 5 years in all households from each survey cluster. Collected data were analyzed between September 1 and December 31, 2022.ExposuresHistorical flood events during 2009 through 2019 were obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory.Main Outcome and MeasuresThe main outcome was diarrhea prevalence among children younger than 5 years in the 2 weeks before the survey was conducted. Results were analyzed by binomial generalized linear mixed-effects logistic regression models with nested random intercepts for country and survey cluster.ResultsAmong 639 250 children making up the complete data series (excluding 274 847 children with missing values for diarrhea or baseline characteristics), 6365 (mean [SD] age, 28.9 [17.2] months; 3214 boys [50.5%]; 3151 girls [49.5%]) were exposed to floods during the 8 weeks after a flood started. The prevalence of diarrhea was 13.2% (n = 839) among exposed children and 12.7% (n = 80 337) among unexposed children. Exposure to floods was associated with increased diarrhea risk, with the highest odds ratio (OR) observed during the second to fourth weeks after floods started (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.73). When floods were stratified by severity and duration, significant associations were observed only for extreme floods (OR during the third to fifth weeks, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.37-3.11) or floods lasting more than 2 weeks (OR during the second to fourth weeks, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.92), with significantly stronger associations than for less extreme floods or shorter-duration floods, respectively. The OR during the first 4 weeks after the start of floods was significantly higher for floods preceded by a 6-month or longer drought (12-month drought OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.53-2.52) than for floods not preceded by a 6-month or longer drought (12-month drought OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79-1.27).ConclusionsThese findings suggest that floods, especially severe floods, long-duration floods, and floods preceded by drought, are associated with an increased risk of diarrhea among children younger than 5 years living in low- and middle-income countries. With the projected increasing frequency and intensity of floods and drought under climate change, greater collective efforts are needed to protect children's health from these compounding events.

A detailed understanding of Tuvalu's wave climate is therefore critical for decision-makers, coastal engineers, and disaster-risk managers. Here, we investigate Tuvalu's wind-wave climate, changes due to large-scale climate variability, and long-term trends. A 44-year (1979-2022) high-resolution wave hindcast was developed using the unstructured version of the wave model Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN). The model resolution varied between 20 km offshore in deep water and 300 m close to shore. The model was forfed with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) wind and boundary wave conditions. Northern and Southern Hemisphere winter months produced the largest and most powerful waves. Through the analysis of the directional wave energy spectra, we identified three main wave energy sources: (a) extratropical storms in the Southern Ocean; (b) extratropical storms in the North Pacific; and (c) easterly trade winds. Slightly positive trends in high-frequency (similar to 10 s) wave energy from the east and low-frequency (similar to 15 s) wave energy from the southwest were linked to an intensification of trade winds and an intensification and poleward displacement of the Southern Ocean storm belt over recent decades. The interannual variability of Tuvalu's wave climate was strongly linked to large-scale climate modes such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Arctic and Antarctic Oscillation. The study builds on previous research and significantly enhances the understanding of Tuvalu's wave climate variability. Plain Language Summary Waves are one of the main causes of coastal flooding and shoreline change in low-lying atoll nations like Tuvalu. A detailed understanding of Tuvalu's wave climate is therefore critical for decision-makers, coastal engineers, and disaster-risk managers. In this study, we investigate Tuvalu's wind-wave climate using a 44-year (1979-2022) high-resolution wave hindcast. A strong seasonality in significant wave height and wave power was found with Northern and Southern Hemisphere winter months producing the largest and most powerful waves. We identified three main wave energy sources: (a) extratropical storms in the Southern Ocean; (b) extratropical storms in the North Pacific; and (c) easterly trade winds. An intensification of the easterly trade winds, as well as an intensification and poleward shift of the Southern Ocean storm belt over recent decades resulted in slight positive trends in wave energy. The interannual variability of Tuvalu's wave climate was strongly linked to large-scale climate modes such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Arctic and Antarctic Oscillation. The study builds on previous research and enhances the understanding of Tuvalu's wave climate variability. The hindcast may be a useful tool to study other processes like long-term shoreline change.

A warming climate will certainly affect these extremes and the associated rain-snow transitions. The goal of this study is to investigate the characteristics and variability of rain-snow transitions aloft and how they will change in the future. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations were conducted from 2000 to 2013 and these were repeated in a warmer pseudo-global warming (PGW) future. Rain-snow transitions occurred aloft throughout the year over the southern Canadian Rockies, but their elevations and depths were highly variable, especially across the continental divide. In PGW conditions, with future air temperatures up to 4-5 & DEG;C higher on average over the Canadian Rockies, rain-snow transitions are projected to occur more often throughout the year, except during summer. The near-0 & DEG;C conditions associated with rain-snow transitions are expected to increase in elevation by more than 500 m, resulting in more rain reaching the surface. Overall, this study illustrates the variability of rain-snow transitions, which often impact the location of the snowline. This study also demonstrates the non-uniform changes under PGW conditions, due in part to differences in the types of weather patterns that generate rain-snow transitions across the region.

Bon nombre de ces precipitations sont associees a des transitions pluie-neige, qui sont tres variables dans le temps et l'espace en raison de la complexite de la topographie. Le rechauffement climatique aura certainement une incidence sur ces extremes et les transitions pluie-neige qui y sont associees. Cette etude vise a examiner les caracteristiques et la variabilite des transitions pluie-neige en altitude et leur evolution future. Des simulations de Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) ont ete effectuees de 2000 a 2013 et ont ete repetees dans un avenir plus chaud de pseudo-rechauffement global (PRG). Des transitions pluie-neige se sont produites en altitude tout au long de l'annee sur le sud des Rocheuses canadiennes, mais leur altitude et leur profondeur etaient tres variables, en particulier de part et d'autre de la ligne continentale de partage des eaux. Dans les conditions de PRG, avec des temperatures de l'air futures jusqu'a 4-5 & DEG;C plus elevees en moyenne sur les Rocheuses canadiennes, les transitions pluie-neige devraient se produire plus souvent tout au long de l'annee, sauf en ete. Les conditions proches de 0 & DEG;C associees aux transitions pluie-neige devraient augmenter l'altitude de plus de 500 m, ce qui signifie que davantage de pluie atteindra la surface. Dans l'ensemble, cette etude illustre la variabilite des transitions pluie-neige, qui ont souvent une incidence sur l'emplacement de la limite de la neige. Cette etude montre egalement les changements non uniformes dans les conditions du PRG, attribuables en partie aux differences dans les types de modeles meteorologiques qui generent des transitions pluie-neige a travers la region.

Besides social and economic consequences for mining sites, these changes also involve the rebound of ground water that changes the local stress state and may induce ground movements, microseismicity, and gas anomalies. In order to contribute to the understanding of the geomechanical coupling of subsur-face stress changes and surface ground movements, we present and discuss petrographic and petrophysical data of Upper Carboniferous (Westphalian B-C), fluvial, tight (most porosities <10%, most permeabilities <1 mD) sandstones and silt-stones from the former Ibbenbueren coal mine in NW Germany where mine flooding currently proceeds. Varying and comparatively high compressional (3,809-6,656 m/s) and shear wave velocities (2,126-3,723 m/s), and Young's moduli (31.3-80.9 GPa) are associated with Cretaceous maximum burial by which the textural framework was predominantly mechanically compacted and subordinately cemented by syntaxial quartz overgrowths. Grain size (0.008-1.1 mm) as a function of the depositional environment controls wave velocities and Young's moduli. In contrast, the range of Poisson's ratios (0.09-0.31) is typical for sandstones and depends on stress history, depositional and diagenetic mineralogy. Conse-quently, the textural and mineralogical heterogeneities of the sample set result in variations in wave velocities, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratios. These petrophysical properties are crucial for the poroelastic behaviour of the subsurface and need to be considered in case studies, which model post-mining ground movements as a result of mine flooding. Kurzfassung: Im Zuge der Erschopfung von Rohstoffen, unwirtschaftlicher Forderung, des Klimawandels und der Ener-giewende unterliegen die europaischen Steinkohlereviere einem Wandel. Neben sozialen und okonomischen Folgen umfasst dieser Wandel auch den Wiederanstieg des Grundwassers, welcher anderungen im lokalen Spannungszustand hervorruft und Bodenbewegungen, Mikroseismizitat und Gasanomalien verursachen kann. Um einen Beitrag zum Verstandnis der geomechanischen Kopplung von Spannungsanderungen im Untergrund mit Oberflachenbewegungen zu leisten, untersu-chen wir in dieser Studie petrographische und petrophysikalische Daten dichter (Porositaten uberwiegend <10%, Permeabi-litaten uberwiegend <1 mD), fluviatiler Sand-und Siltsteine des Oberkarbons (Westfal B-C) aus dem ehemaligen Steinkoh-lerevier Ibbenburen in Nordwestdeutschland, wo der Grundwasserspiegel aktuell ansteigt. Variierende und vergleichsweise hohe Elastizitatsmoduln (31,3-80,9 GPa), Primar-(3.809-6.656 m/s) und Scherwellengeschwindigkeiten (2.126-3.723 m/s) stehen im Zusammenhang mit kreidezeitlicher Versenkung, wodurch die Gesteine vor allem mechanisch kompaktiert und nachrangig durch syntaxiale Quarzuberwuchse zementiert wurden. Die Korngrosse (0,008-1,1 mm) als Resultat der Ablage-rungsumgebung bestimmt die Elastizitatsmoduln und Wellengeschwindigkeiten. Im Gegensatz dazu hangen die sandstein-typischen Poissonzahlen (0,09-0,31) von der Spannungsgeschichte und der detritischen sowie diagenetischen Mineralogie ab. Variationen in den Elastizitatsmoduln, Primar-und Scherwellengeschwindigkeiten liegen daher in der Heterogenitat des Gefuges und der Mineralogie begrundet. Diese petrophysikalischen Eigenschaften sind entscheidend fur das poroelastische Verhalten des Untergrundes und mussen in Fallstudien, die Bodenbewegungen in Folge einer Bergwerksflutung modellie-ren, berucksichtig werden.

Markus; Sein, Dmitry, V			Atmospheric rivers in CMIP5 climate ensembles downscaled with a high-resolution regional climate model	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; BALTIC SEA; FUTURE CHANGES; EURO-CORDEX; WEST-COAST; PROJECTIONS; SCENARIOS; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; IMPACTS	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are important drivers of hazardous precipitation levels and are often associated with intense floods. So far, the response of ARs to climate change in Europe has been investigated using global climate models within the CMIP5 framework. However, the spatial resolution of those models (1-3 degrees) is too coarse for an adequate assessment of local to regional precipitation patterns. Using a regional climate model with 0.22 degrees resolution, we downscaled an ensemble consisting of 1 ERA-Interim (ERAI) reanalysis data hindcast simulation, 9 global historical, and 24 climate scenario simulations following greenhouse gas emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The performance of the climate model to simulate AR frequencies and AR-induced precipitation was tested against ERAI. Overall, we find a good agreement between the downscaled CMIP5 historical simulations and ERAI. However, the downscaled simulations better represented small-scale spatial characteristics. This was most evident over the terrain of the Iberian Peninsula, where the AR-induced precipitation pattern clearly reflected prominent east-west topographical elements, resulting in zonal bands of high and low AR impact. Over central Europe, the models simulated a smaller propagation distance of ARs toward eastern Europe than obtained using the ERAI data. Our models showed that ARs in a future warmer climate will be more frequent and more intense, especially in the higher-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5). However, assuming low emissions (RCP2.6), the related changes can be mostly mitigated. According to the high-emission scenario RCP8.5, AR-induced precipitation will increase by 20 %-40 % in western central Europe, whereas mean precipitation rates increase by a maximum of only 12 %. Over the Iberian Peninsula, AR-induced precipitation will slightly decrease (similar to 6 %) but the decrease in the mean rate will be larger (similar to 15 %). These changes will lead to an overall increased fractional contribution of ARs to heavy precipitation, with the greatest impact over the Iberian Peninsula (15 %-30 %) and western France (similar to 15 %). Likewise, the fractional share of yearly maximum precipitation attributable to ARs will increase over the Iberian Peninsula, the UK, and western France. Over Norway, average AR precipitation rates will decline by -5 % to -30 %, most likely due to dynamic changes, with ARs originating from latitudes > 60 degrees N decreasing by up to 20 % and those originating south of 45 degrees N increasing. This suggests that ARs over Norway will follow longer routes over the continent, such that additional moisture uptake will be impeded. By contrast, ARs from > 60 degrees N will take up moisture from the North Atlantic before making landfall over Norway. The found changes in the local AR pathway are probably driven by larger-scale circulation changes such as a change in dominating weather regimes and/or changes in the winter storm track over the North Atlantic.

Multi-decadal shoreline change in coastal natural world heritage sites - a global assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						shoreline change; multi-decadal; local and global scales; UNESCO; conservation; world natural heritage sites; sea-level rise; coastal heritage; erosion; recession; accretion	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; WADDEN SEA; VARIABILITY; OSCILLATION; EROSION; DELTA; TRANSFORMATIONS; IMPACTS; TRENDS	Natural World Heritage Sites (NWHS), which are of Outstanding Universal Value, are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic pressures. This is especially true for coastal NWHS, which are additionally subject to erosion and flooding. This paper assesses shoreline change from 1984 to 2016 within the boundaries of 67 designated sites, providing a first global consistent assessment of its drivers. It develops a transferable methodology utilising new satellite-derived global shoreline datasets, which are classified based on linearity of change against time and compared with global datasets of geomorphology (topography, land cover, coastal type, and lithology), climate variability and sea-level change. Significant shoreline change is observed on 14% of 52 coastal NWHS shorelines that show the largest recessional and accretive trends (means of -3.4 m yr(-1)and 3.5 m yr(-1), respectively). These rapid shoreline changes are found in low-lying shorelines (<1 m elevation) composed of unconsolidated sediments in vegetated tidal coastal systems (means of -7.7 m yr(-1)and 12.5 m yr(-1)), and vegetated tidal deltas at the mouth of large river systems (means of -6.9 m yr(-1)and 11 m yr(-1)). Extreme shoreline changes occur as a result of redistribution of sediment driven by a combination of geomorphological conditions with (1) specific natural coastal morphodynamics such as opening of inlets (e.g.Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve) or gradients of alongshore sediment transport (e.g.Namib Sea) and (2) direct or indirect human interferences with natural coastal processes such as sand nourishment (e.g.Wadden Sea) and damming of river sediments upstream of a delta (e.g.Danube Delta).The most stable soft coasts are associated with the protection of coral reef ecosystems (e.g.Great Barrier Reef) which may be degraded/destroyed by climate change or human stress in the future. A positive correlation between shoreline retreat and local relative sea-level change was apparent in theWadden Sea. However, globally, the effects of contemporary sea-level rise are not apparent for coastal NWHS, but it is a major concern for the future reinforcing the shoreline dynamics already being observed due to other drivers. Hence, future assessments of shoreline change need to account for other drivers of coastal change in addition to sea-level rise projections. In conclusion, extreme multi-decadal linear shoreline trends occur in coastal NWHS and are driven primarily by sediment redistribution. Future exacerbation of these trends may affect heritage values and coastal communities. Thus shoreline change should be considered in future management plans where necessary. This approach provides a consistent method to assess NWHS which can be repeated and help steer future management of these important sites.

The ratio of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is applied to analyse the spatial and temporal distributions of the aridity index in the Belt and Road region under the 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming scenarios on the basis of outputs from four downscaled global climate models. The results show that: (1) Under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario, the area-averaged aridity index will be similar to that in 1986-2005 (around 1.58), but the changes vary spatially. The aridity index will increase by more than 5% in Central-Eastern Europe, north of West Asia, the monsoon region of East Asia and northwest of Southeast Asia, while it is projected to decrease obviously in the southeast of West Asia. Regarding the seasonal scale, spring and winter will be more arid in South Asia, and the monsoon region of East Asia will be slightly drier in summer compared with the reference period. While, West Asia will be wetter in all seasons, except winter. (2) Relative to 1986-2005, both areal averaged annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation are projected to increase, and the spatial variation of aridity index will become more obvious as well at the 2.0 degrees C warming level. Although the aridity index over the entire region will be maintained at approximately 1.57 as that in 1.5 degrees C, the index in Central- Eastern Europe, north of West Asia and Central Asia will grow rapidly at a rate of more than 20%, while that in West Siberia, northwest of China, the southern part of South Asia and West Asia will show a declining trend. At the seasonal scale, the increase of the aridity index in Central-Eastern Europe, Central Asia, West Asia, South Asia and the northern part of Siberia in winter will be obvious, and the monsoon region in East Asia will be drier in both summer and autumn. (3) Under the scenario of an additional 0.5 degrees C increase in global temperature from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C, the aridity index will increase significantly in Central Asia and north of West Asia but decrease in Southeast Asia and Central Siberia. Seasonally, the aridity index in the Belt and Road region will slightly increase in all other seasons except spring. Central Asia will become drier annually at a rate of more than 20%. The aridity index in South Asia will increase in spring and winter, and that in East Asia will increase in autumn and winter. (4) To changes of the aridity index, the attribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration will vary regionally. Precipitation will be the major influencing factor over southern West Asia, southern South Asia, Central-Eastern Siberia, the non-monsoon region of East Asia and the border between West Asia and Central Asia, while potential evapotranspiration will exert greater effects over Central-Eastern Europe, West Siberia, Central Asia and the monsoon region of East Asia.

The increased melting has enhanced the susceptibility for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the region. The catastrophic failure of potentially dangerous glacial lakes could be detrimental to human life and infrastructure in the adjacent low-lying areas. This study attempts to assess the GLOF hazard of Gangabal lake, located in the Upper Jhelum basin of Kashmir Himalaya, using the combined approaches of remote sensing, GIS, and dam break modeling. The parameters, such as area change, ice thickness, mass balance, and surface velocity of the Harmukh glacier, which feeds Gangabal lake, were also assessed using multitemporal satellite data, GlabTop-2, and the Cosi-Corr model. In the worst-case scenario, 100% volume (73 x 10(6) m(3)) of water was considered to be released from the lake with a breach formation time (bf) of 40 min, breach width (bw) of 60 m, and producing peak discharge of 16,601.03 m(3)/s. Our results reveal that the lake area has increased from 1.42 km(2) in 1972 to 1.46 km(2) in 1981, 1.58 km(2) in 1992, 1.61 km(2) in 2001, 1.64 km(2) in 2010, and 1.66 km(2) in 2020. The lake area experienced 17 +/- 2% growth from 1972 to 2020 at an annual rate of 0.005 km(2). The feeding glacier (Harmukh) contrarily indicated a significant area loss of 0.7 +/- 0.03 km(2) from 1990 (3.36 km(2)) to 2020 (2.9 km(2)). The glacier has a maximum, minimum, and average depth of 85, 7.3, and 23.46 m, respectively. In contrast, the average velocity was estimated to be 3.2 m/yr with a maximum of 7 m/yr. The results obtained from DEM differencing show an average ice thickness loss of 11.04 +/- 4.8 m for Harmukh glacier at the rate of 0.92 +/- 0.40 m/yr between 2000 and 2012. Assessment of GLOF propagation in the worst-case scenario (scenario-1) revealed that the maximum flood depth varies between 3.87 and 68 m, the maximum flow velocity between 4 and 75 m/s, and the maximum water surface elevation varies between 1548 and 3536 m. The resultant flood wave in the worst-case scenario will reach the nearest location (Naranaag temple) within 90 min after breach initiation with a maximum discharge of 12,896.52 m(3) s(-1) and maximum flood depth and velocity of 10.54 m and 10.05 m/s, respectively. After evaluation of GLOF impacts on surrounding areas, the area under each inundated landuse class was estimated through the LULC map generated for both scenarios 1 and 2. In scenario 1, the total potentially inundated area was estimated as 5.3 km(2), which is somewhat larger than 3.46 km(2) in scenario 2. We suggest a location-specific comprehensive investigation of Gangbal lake and Harmukh glacier by applying the advanced hazard and risk assessment models/methods for better predicting a probable future GLOF event.

Rising Coastal Groundwater as a Result of Sea-Level Rise Will Influence Contaminated Coastal Sites and Underground Infrastructure	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate change; sea level rise; groundwater rise; environmental justice; coastal infrastructure; contamination	TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; DYNAMICS; AQUIFER; METALS; TIDES; WATER	Sea-level rise (SLR) will cause coastal groundwater to rise in many coastal urban environments. Inundation of contaminated soils by groundwater rise (GWR) will alter the physical, biological, and geochemical conditions that influence the fate and transport of existing contaminants. These transformed products can be more toxic and/or more mobile under future conditions driven by SLR and GWR. We reviewed the vulnerability of contaminated sites to GWR in a US national database and in a case comparison with the San Francisco Bay region to estimate the risk of rising groundwater to human and ecosystem health. The results show that 326 sites in the US Superfund program may be vulnerable to changes in groundwater depth or flow direction as a result of SLR, representing 18.1 million hectares of contaminated land. In the San Francisco Bay Area, we found that GWR is predicted to impact twice as much land area as inundation from SLR, and 5,282 additional state-managed sites of contamination may be vulnerable to inundation from GWR in a 1.0 m SLR scenario. Increases of only a few centimeters of elevation can mobilize soil contaminants, alter flow directions in a heterogeneous urban environment with underground pipes and utility trenches, and result in new exposure pathways. Pumping for flood protection will elevate the saltwater interface, changing groundwater salinity and mobilizing metals in soil. Socially vulnerable communities are disproportionately exposed to this risk at both the national scale and in a regional comparison with the San Francisco Bay Area. We estimated the number of sites with known contamination in the US Superfund program at the national scale and found 326 Superfund sites that may be exposed to inundation from below as rising sea levels push groundwater higher along the coast. California, North Carolina, Virginia, and New York have the largest area of federally managed contaminated land that may be exposed. Thousands of additional sites are managed by state agencies. We conducted a comparison in the San Francisco Bay Area that included state-managed sites. We found that more than 5,000 sites in the San Francisco region may be exposed to rising groundwater with sea-level rise (SLR) of 1.0 m, including 1,480 open sites, and an additional 3,817 closed sites that may contain residual contaminants. If the ratio of Superfund to state-managed sites in this region (1:406) holds, the number of at-risk contaminated sites nationally may be more than 132,000. Low-income residents and people of color are disproportionately represented near these sites and therefore may face higher risks. Additional sub-regional research is urgently needed to understand these exposures. Interactions will occur between the salinity of rising coastal groundwater and shallow pumping, affecting infrastructure and building foundations. Adaptation plans must consider rising groundwater to avoid widespread failures. Rising sea levels will cause rising groundwater to inundate some coastal contaminated sites, mobilizing pollutants and causing corrosionWe found 326 Superfund sites that may be at risk nationally, and more than 5,000 state managed sites in a San Francisco Bay area comparisonSocially vulnerable communities are disproportionately exposed to this hazard, with potential impacts on indoor air, foundations and infrastructure	[Hill, K.; Lindquist, C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hirschfeld, D.; Cook, F.] Utah State Univ, Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Logan, UT USA; [Warner, S.] Univ Newcastle, Global Ctr Environm Remediat, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Warner, S.] BBJ Grp, San Rafael, CA USA	University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Newcastle	Hill, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.	kzhill@berkeley.edu		Hirschfeld, Daniella/0000-0001-9664-7594	We wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped to improve this paper.

The difficulties of locating occupation sites in this landscape cannot be overestimated. Although valuable for its preservation of palaeosols, the accumulation of sediment deposited by the river Cauca and its tributaries during periods of flooding can be extremely rapid and the earlier archaeological sites (1000 B.C. to 500 A.D.) are generally buried beneath several metres of alluvium. Under these circumstances, traditional site survey has limited potential and the most promising strategy is the location of palaeosols with evidence of human activity based on soil analysis and palaeobotanical studies. Sedimentology from a dozen deep cores is providing invaluable information on the environments that early human populations in the area would have enjoyed or coped with. The cores testify to a highly dynamic river Cauca and its tributaries resulting in a series of rapid local environmental changes. Besides extensive periodic flooding, past populations were probably affected by tectonic events since numerous faults cross the region. Volcanic ash is a component of many of the soil cores but much was redeposited material from earlier falls, probably during the Pleistocene. Direct archaeological evidence of human activity during the Early and Middle Holocene is limited to a mastodon skeleton with butchering marks on its ribs, and to a surface find of a stone tool (azada) characteristic of this period. Of the numerous fertile palaeosols detected in cores, some have agricultural characteristics and there is evidence of fires, possibly for clearing fields, from the late seventh millennium B.C. while by the third millennium B.C. a site provides evidence of burning in combination with the cultivation of maize (Zea mays) and arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). While a relatively large number of archaeological sites testify to human activity over much of southwestern Colombia during the Early and Middle Holocene, research has drawn attention to a period of archaeological silence between 2500 and 1000 B.C. when Formative societies were developing in other regions of South America. An important focus of this project is the search for traces of human activity during this period. The palaeosols have important potential for acquiring information on this question since stratigraphical evidence suggests that many lie within this time range. By the Late Holocene (c. 500 B.C.) the Ilama population was established in that region of the alluvial valley centred on Lake Sonso and the town of Palmira, followed by Yotoco and, further south, Malagana; in contrast, in the northern sector of the valley evidence for this sequence remains tentative. Here the only settlement site located so far with very late Formative characteristics produced an entirely new style of pottery. This site (first century B.C.) was in wooded marshland where houses must have been built on stilts, contrasting with Late Period sites (c. AD 500-1500), occupied by a sequence of different cultural groups of the Sonsoide tradition and located on slightly higher ground within the flood plain or in the piedmont.

Atmospheric River Sequences as Indicators of Hydrologic Hazard in Historical Reanalysis and GFDL SPEAR Future Climate Projections	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						atmospheric rivers; sequences; hydrologic hazard; temporal compounding; climate change; compound events	US WEST-COAST; BIAS CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; EVENTS; CALIFORNIA; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS; FLOODS	When multiple atmospheric rivers (ARs) occur in rapid succession, the combined effect on the hydrologic system can lead to more flooding and damage than would be expected from the individual events. This temporally compounding risk is a source of growing concern for water managers in California. We present a novel moving average-based definition of AR "sequences" that identifies the time periods of elevated hydrologic hazard that occur during and after consecutive AR events. This marks the first quantitative evaluation of when temporal compounding is contributing to AR flood risk. We also assess projected changes in sequence frequency, intensity, and duration in California using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Seamless System for Prediction and EArth system Research (GFDL SPEAR) global coupled model. Sequence frequency increases over time and is fairly uniform across the state under both intermediate (SSP2-4.5) and very high (SSP5-8.5) emissions scenarios, with the largest changes occurring by the end of the century (+0.72 sequences/year in SSP2-4.5, +1.13 sequences/year in SSP5-8.5). Sequence intensity and duration both see increases in the medians and extreme values of their respective distributions relative to the historical baselines. In particular, "super-sequence" events longer than 60 days are projected to occur 2-3x more frequently and to emerge in places that have never seen them in the historical record. In a world where California precipitation is becoming more variable, our definition of sequences will help identify when and where hydrologic impacts will be most extreme, which can in turn support better management of the state's highly variable water resources and inform future flood mitigation strategies. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a type of storm that are vital to water resources in the western United States, but can also cause significant flooding and damage. Back-to-back AR events have historically been a source of concern for water managers because the compound effect of multiple events together can increase the probability of damaging floods. We present a definition of AR "sequences" that identifies periods of time where the likelihood of compound effects is increased. We look at the relationship between sequences, runoff, and soil moisture in California and show that sequences are in fact aligning with time windows of elevated hydrologic hazard in the historical record. We then look at sequences in two future climate projections and find that sequence frequency, intensity, and duration are all projected to increase with increasing emissions levels. In particular, "super-sequences" more than 60 days long are projected to become two to three times more frequent across all of California. Our definition of sequences captures and communicates new information about the risk associated with temporally compounding hydrologic events in present and future climates. We introduce atmospheric river (AR) sequences as a way to measure the hydrologic hazard from temporally compounding (back-to-back) ARsAR sequences in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Seamless System for Prediction and EArth system Research (GFDL SPEAR) model projections increase in frequency, intensity, and duration in California by the end of the century"Super-sequences" over 60 days long drive the projected increase in frequency and present a growing water management threat in California	[Bowers, C.; Baker, J.

J	Feldman, CH; Wunderlich, S				Feldman, Charles H.; Wunderlich, Shahla			Cultural food distancing: a conceptual discourse on the evolution of seminal to present and future models of traditional food practices	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Review						Traditional foods; Environmental crisis; Food practices; Food and culture; Food and culture theory; Foodways	ETHNIC FOOD; CONSUMPTION; IDENTITY; COVID-19; IMPACT; TASTE; SELF	Purpose -This manuscript focuses on theoretical past, present and future models for defining food culture and cuisine, comparing these principles with contemporary literature evidence of transformative global food practices during public health and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to explain the point at which traditional practices are discernible from the effects of modern technology, globalization, marketing and the virtualization of consumption. The paper explains how current local and global ecologies contribute to the retainment or disassembly of established culinary borders. Design/methodology/approach - This is a theoretical paper that highlights seminal and present discourse on food cultural practices. Furthermore, it underlines the cultural changes during environmental crises and whether these cultural transformations in food practices will be lasting. The authors suggest a perspective model for the future. Findings - Deciphering whether traditional food ways are moderated by modernity and environmental changes is very complex and multifactorial. This is likely nuanced by the availability of commodities and the steadfastness of particular cultures. Whether or not consumers embrace a new food product is likely contingent on their fundamental familiarity with and availability of the product's traditional components. The integrity of traditional foodstuffs will continue to be valued and demanded by broad groups of consumers into the foreseeable future. Research limitations/implications - As a primary objective, food producers, manufacturers and governments should not seek to actively diminish cultural borders and markets. Industry and governmental strategists should embrace and promote cultural food messages in any interventional strategies on household food security or marketing strategies and campaigns. The gathering of information from grassroot cultural groups about traditional food practices should ground the development of new policies and products. Practical implications - Understanding the complexities surrounding traditional cuisines and food ways gives insight into the future of traditional food cultures and how they change. The food industry is undergoing profound transformation due to climate change; the decrease of arable land; environmental crisis, such as floods and droughts; war; food insecurity; aging populations; and chronic food-related diseases and disorders. Therefore, new food products are essential to adjust to these issues. However, the use and effectiveness of these foods would likely be enhanced if they were tailored with ingredients and techniques that have meaning to particular cultural groups. Social implications - Social connectivity, the shared experiences of eating together (and the contingent health benefits) may have been subject to contemporaneous or permanent change due to transformation in local and global food ecologies. Whether or not consumers embrace new food products may be contingent on their fundamental familiarity with its traditional components. The integrity of traditional foodstuffs is likely to continue to be valued and demanded by broad groups of consumers into the foreseeable future. Originality/value - Seminal food culture theories are still being utilized in recent publications to explain contemporary practices, particularly in times of crisis such as the recent pandemic. Current scholarship has indicated, to degrees, that links to traditional food practices may be strong, evolving or are becoming more obscure as they are incorporated into a global fabric. There are gaps in the literature that necessitate more exportation of the impact of environmental changes and health crisis on cultural and traditional food practices. This further raises questions about how the formative theories on food culture apply to modern and future food practices.

Fire Affects Asymbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Southern Amazon Forests	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						climate change; free-living diazotrophs; nitrogen-15; stoichiometry; tropical soils; wildfire	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SOIL; DYNAMICS; SAVANNA; CARBON; PLANT; LIMITATION; VEGETATION; HOMOGENIZATION; MINERALIZATION	In this study, we investigate the biogeochemical consequences of fire in seasonally flooded Amazon forests, where recent declines in forest cover have been linked to increases in fire frequency and severity. Previous studies have hypothesized that a quasi-permanent state-shift transition from typical Amazon forests to open savannas can occur when fire results in further depletion of already impoverished soil nutrient pools. Asymbiotic N-2 fixation (ANF) is an essential pathway for fire-affected forests to acquire nitrogen (N) after disturbance, but ANF response to fire has yet to be quantified in Amazonia. Here, we quantify ANF through field sampling and laboratory incubations using N-15-labeled dinitrogen (N-15(2)) and measurement of 14 biogeochemical parameters in surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-30 cm) soils. Our data represent burned and unburned replicated sampling sites, across five stands, spanning a gradient from infrequent (once in 13 years) to frequent (five times in 13 years) fire occurrences. ANF did not vary with fire frequency but was, on average, 24% lower in burned than in unburned surface soils across all stands. Burned and unburned subsurface soils had similar ANF rates. About 58% of ANF variance was explained by the joint effect of carbon (C):N ratio and available phosphorus (P) in burned and unburned soils. ANF increased linearly with C:N and P availability in unburned soils, but a highly non-linear relationship was observed in burned soils. Our findings show that fire alters soil C-to-nutrient stoichiometry, which resulted in lower N inputs via ANF into burned relative to unburned tropical forest soils. Plain Language Summary The impact of fire on biological N-2 fixation in tropical forests is poorly understood. In Amazon forests, most of the N is recycled through the litter layer, which is mostly consumed during a fire event. Therefore, asymbiotic biological N-2 fixation (ANF) in the soil-the conversion of atmospheric N-2 into plant-available N by free-living soil bacteria or archaea-is expected to be a significant source of N for vegetation growth after fire events. We measured rates of soil ANF as well as soil C and P, which are known to affect N cycling in tropical forests. Rates of ANF were 24% lower in burned compared to unburned surface soils (0-10 cm), while no difference was detected in subsurface soils (10-30 cm). At both soil depths, ANF was expected to increase linearly with C:N ratio and P availability, but non-linear relationships between soil variables make predictions more challenging in burned soils regardless of fire frequency. Our findings suggest that decreased N inputs due to post-fire ANF suppression could help accelerate the transition from Amazon forests to open savannas. Key Points Asymbiotic N-2 fixation (ANF) was quantified for the first time in fire-affected seasonally flooded Amazon forests ANF rates were, on average, 24% lower in burned compared to unburned surface soils (0-10 cm) Soil carbon:nitrogen ratio and available phosphorus explained 58% of ANF variance in burned and unburned soils	[Bomfim, Barbara; Doane, Timothy A.; Horwath, William R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Soils & Biogeochem Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bomfim, Barbara; Silva, Lucas C.

In response to this situation, watershed-wide flood management is attracting attention around the world as a promising approach. Under these situations, Japan has also made a policy shift to watershed-based flood management, which aims to manage floods and control runoff in the entire watershed. For this management, it is essential to obtain areal hydraulic information, especially flow information, from each location in the watershed. To measure river flow, it is necessary to measure water level and velocity. While it is becoming possible to make area-based observations of water levels using simple methods, various attempts have been made to measure the velocity, but continuous data cannot be obtained using simple methods. Low-cost flow velocity meters would facilitate the simultaneous and continuous accumulation of data at multiple points and enable the acquisition of areal flow information for watersheds, which is important for watershed-based flood management. This study aims to develop an inexpensive, simple velocity meter that can be used to make areal measurements within watersheds, and to make this velocity meter usable by residents, thereby contributing to citizen science. Therefore, experimental studies were conducted on a method of measuring flow velocity based on the simple physical phenomenon of rising water surface elevations due to increased pressure at the stagnation point. First, we placed the cylinders in the river or waterway, observed the afflux, and compared the velocities calculated using Bernoulli's theorem with the velocities at the experimental site. By multiplying the calculated flow velocity by 0.9, the average flow velocity was found to be obtained. Then, by using a large pitot tube with a hole diameter of about 5 mm, the rise in water level in the pitot tube was measured using a pressure-type water level meter, and the flow velocity was calculated using the pitot tube theory and compared with the flow velocity at the location of the hole at the experimental site. By multiplying the calculated velocity by 1.04, the velocity at the location of the hole can be obtained. In addition, the same experiment was conducted using a pitot tube with a slit. The slit tube was placed vertically with the slit facing upstream. Measurements were taken in the same method as for the pitot tube velocity meter and compared to the velocity at that point. By multiplying the calculated flow velocity by 0.99, the average flow velocity at that location can be obtained. These results indicate that a flow velocity measurement method utilizing stagnation points can lead to the development of inexpensive velocity meters. Because of the simplicity of this meter, there is a possibility that citizens can participate in the observation to obtain information on the flow velocity during floods and areal information within a watershed.

Given the continually available digitized up-to-date, long-term, and fine resolution precipitation dataset from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service's (USDAFS) Experimental Forests and Ranges (EF) rain gauge stations, it is both important and relevant to develop precipitation IDF from onsite dataset (Onsite-IDF) that incorporates the most recent time period, aiding in the design, and planning of forest road-stream crossing structures (RSCS) in headwaters to maintain resilient forest ecosystems. Here we developed Onsite-IDFs for hourly and sub-hourly duration, and 25-yr, 50-yr, and 100-yr design return intervals (RIs) from annual maxima series (AMS) of precipitation intensities (PIs) modeled by applying Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis and L-moment based parameter estimation methodology at six USDAFS EFs and compared them with precipitation IDFs obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlas 14 (NOAA-Atlas14). A regional frequency analysis (RFA) was performed for EFs where data from multiple precipitation gauges are available. NOAA's station-based precipitation IDFs were estimated for comparison using RFA (NOAA-RFA) at one of the EFs where NOAA-Atlas14 precipitation IDFs are unavailable. Onsite-IDFs were then evaluated against the PIs from NOAA-Atlas14 and NOAA-RFA by comparing their relative differences and storm frequencies. Results show considerable relative differences between the Onsite- and NOAA-Atlas14 (or NOAA-RFA) IDFs at these EFs, some of which are strongly dependent on the storm durations and elevation of precipitation gauges, particularly in steep, forested sites of H. J. Andrews (HJA) and Coweeta Hydrological Laboratory (CHL) EFs. At the higher elevation gauge of HJA EF, NOAA-RFA based precipitation IDFs underestimate PI of 25-yr, 50-yr, and 100-yr RIs by considerable amounts for 12-h and 24-h duration storm events relative to the Onsite-IDFs. At the low-gradient Santee (SAN) EF, the PIs of 3- to 24-h storm events with 100-yr frequency (or RI) from NOAA-Atlas14 gauges are found to be equivalent to PIs of more frequent storm events (25-50-yr RI) as estimated from the onsite dataset. Our results recommend use of the Onsite-IDF estimates for the estimation of design storm peak discharge rates at the higher elevation catchments of HJA, CHL, and SAN EF locations, particularly for longer duration events, where NOAA-based precipitation IDFs underestimate the PIs relative to the Onsite-IDFs. This underscores the importance of long-term high resolution EF data for new applications including ecological restorations and indicates that planning and design teams should use as much local data as possible or account for potential PI inconsistencies or underestimations if local data are unavailable.

Among the anthropogenic agents, flow regulation by dams, gravel mining; artificial land use and land cover changes together with climate change are the most frequently studied. Medium and short term geomorphological adjustments and riparian vegetation cover changes have been frequently studied by using a variety of methodological approaches, with the diachronic analysis of orthophotographs as the most common starting point. The main objective of this research is to assess the spatio-temporal evolution of geomorphological conditions and riparian vegetation cover along a 38 km-long reach of the Tagus River, analysing the last 70 years, in order to understand the main drivers leading to those changes. To that purpose, a complementary diagnosis has been carried out by combining different approaches: (1) Simple geomorphological indicators, (2) Specific geomorphic indexes, (3) Landscape metrics and (4) Transition matrices, together with the analysis of flow discharges. Results show that River Tagus has suffered a narrowing process (67.7%) along the entire study period (1946-2014) close to a decrease in width ratio of 2.1 m/year. However, the narrowing trend was not stable along the entire period, with the most dramatic reduction happened between 1956 and 1975 with a decrease ratio around 7.1 m/year for that subperiod. At the same time, woody riparian vegetation, grass and shrubs covers decreased in comparison with 1946 photo while agriculture land increased within initial riparian zone. By combining different approaches, we note the progressive impoverishment of geomorphic status that is more severe when we consider the area (-49%) of fluvial landforms instead of their number (-26%), in parallel with the fragmentation and complexity pattern found for both vegetated and bare gravel bars according to landscape patchiness analysis. Our results show that geomorphic status in the 4 sub-reaches have decreased, although in the case of sub-reach 1 and 4 the response presents a delay with the more important decrease occurring from 1975 to 1999. This geomorphological evolution is explained by the synergic combination of different human pressures along time. Initially, flow regulation by large dams influenced this evolution, but water-transfer since 1979 and floodplain occupation by farmland activities were more relevant with the time. River dynamism, figured out as the amount of area subject to rejuvenation (i.e., evolution toward more pioneer stages) and succession processes (i.e., evolution toward more mature stages), was reduced more than a half along the period 1946-1975, while it completely changed after 1975 where they became close to 10% of the initial dynamism. Thus, our results show by the combination of different approaches that River Tagus channel has become immobilized, reduced with a simplified morphology and its riparian vegetation lost its dynamism converted into a mature wood.

The effects of these recent extreme events on the performance of the Sahel farming systems are still weakly investigated. This study aims at assessing effects of droughts versus floods on crop yield levels and losses, focusing on the so-called recovery period, particularly 2001-2020. A newly developed productivity-drought condition index (PDCI) is utilized to assess agricultural productivity as related to drought or flood in a highly vulnerable region, that is, the Sudanese Sahel. Four farming systems, namely traditional rainfed, mechanized rainfed, gravity irrigated and spate irrigated systems, with sorghum and millet as staple food crops, are considered. The PDCI is defined as a function of the integrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) over the growing season. To address temporal and spatial variabilities, scaling of the PDCI is done in two dimensions: space and time. Crop statistics are used to derive yield losses. Our results show that both drought and flood episodes (seven and six episodes, respectively) can be captured using the PDCI. Drought remains the most relevant risk to Sahel's crop productivity. Some recent large-scale floods led to yield loss. However, floods cause smaller risks to agricultural productivity compared to droughts. Floods may even result in enhanced crop yields. Based upon scaling in the time or space domain, ranking the severity of drought impacts on crop yield for individual years from 2001 to 2020 reveals least to slightly different results. Vulnerability to drought depends on the crop type and farming system. Drought effect on crop yield from the irrigated sector is clear on individual years but not as a general statistical relationship. The parameter 'percentage area under drought' explains around one-third of the variation in the rainfed crop yield. The spate irrigation scheme, the gravity irrigated system and the rainfed farmlands experienced respectively 87%, 57% and 46% of area under drought on average. Irrigated systems produce much higher crop yields than rainfed systems. The mechanized system is more drought-vulnerable than the traditional system. These results call for identifying agricultural management pathways that recognize the combined implications of both hydrological extremes for the region's food security. A newly devised productivity-drought condition index (PDCI) based on integrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) data is used to capture the performance of different Sahel farming systems. The performance is evaluated spatially and temporally in a comparative study of effects of drought versus floods on crop yield levels and losses during 2001-2020. Our research shows that: Crop productivity of all farming systems is severely affected by drought; Flood events can also lead to a decline in productivity, but usually to a much lesser extent; The vulnerability to droughts and floods depends upon the farming system and crop type. Our analysis shows that the farming systems in the Sudanese Sahel have not reverted to conditions that could be described as a Sahel recovery. This study calls for agricultural management decisions, which are specific for the different farming systems, in response to climate variability.image	[Elagib, Nadir Ahmed; Ali, Marwan M.

In Southern Italy, empirical evidence has indicated a general increase in the number of heavy precipitation events, intensity, and frequency. These effects have important consequences for environmental risks such as floods, landslides, and land degradation. The latter includes both rates of soil erosion in upland cultivated areas and sediment delivered downstream. The increase of soil erosion reduces the national incomes obtained from cultivated lands and requires the availability of robust techniques to identify areas at risk. In this context, the use of fallout radionuclides (FRNs), combined with direct measurements of soil loss on experimental sites, can be an important tool to identify the main drivers of land degradation and to understand better the consequences of climate change on larger areas and on a long-term temporal scale.Materials and methodsA long-term plot experiment carried out in Southern Italy, involving direct observations of soil loss and the use of repeated Cs-137 measurements, was performed to estimate soil erosion rates in agricultural areas during the last six decades. More specifically, 11 years of soil loss measurements obtained from four experimental plots were used to document soil erosion rates for the period comprised between 2006 and 2016. In addition, a sampling coring undertaken in four separate field campaigns in 2006, 2010, and 2017 was used to establish the reduction of Cs-137 inventories within the same area and the corresponding estimates of erosion rates.Results and discussionThe Cs-137 analyses related to these sampling campaigns allowed, at a first stage, estimates of soil erosion rates obtained for two different time windows ranging from the commencement of fallout in 1954 to the dates of sampling (2006 and 2017). The estimates related to the longer time window 1954-2017 are close to those provided by a traditional model (RUSLE) for the same period and provided a first validation of the Cs-137 technique. The application of the so-called Cs-137 re-sampling approach which enabled accurate estimates of soil erosion rates for the shorter period comprised between the two sampling campaigns (2006-2017) allowed a direct comparison with the direct observations of soil loss obtained for the same period. This comparison showed a good agreement between estimates and measurements of soil loss and allowed a reconstruction of the general trend of soil erosion rates during the last six decades.ConclusionsThe overall results confirm an increasing trend of soil erosion rates in the study area during the last six decades. Moreover, the estimates of erosion rates provided by the traditional Cs-137 technique are comparable with the corresponding estimates obtained with RUSLE suggesting that, in absence of deposition, the two methods provide similar results. Also, the Cs-137 re-sampling technique proved to be very close to the measured data obtained for the same time window. These findings encourage the use of this strategy in the absence of direct observations of soil loss and suggest its adoption to investigate trends of erosion rate in larger areas and for long-term periods.

Inadequate water and sanitation services, compounded by exposure to flooding and climate change risks, expose inhabitants to environmental contamination causing poor health and wellbeing and degrading ecosystems. However, the exact nature and full scope of risks and exposure pathways between human health and the environment in informal settlements are uncertain. Existing models are limited to microbiological linkages related to faecal-oral exposures at the individual level, and do not account for a broader range of human-environmental variables and interactions that affect population health and wellbeing. Methods: We undertook a 12-month health and environmental assessment in 12 flood-prone informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. We obtained caregiver-reported health data, anthropometric measurements, stool and blood samples from children < 5 years, and health and wellbeing data for children 5-14 years and adult respondents. We collected environmental data including temperature, mosquito and rat species abundance, and water and sediment samples. Demographic, built environment and household asset data were also collected. We combined our data with existing literature to generate a novel planetary health model of health and environment in informal settlements. Results: Across the 12 settlements, 593 households and 2764 participants were enrolled. Two-thirds (64.1%) of all houses (26.3-82.7% per settlement) had formal land tenure documentation. Cough, fever and diarrhoea in the week prior to the survey were reported among an average of 34.3%, 26.9% and 9.7% of children aged < 5 years, respectively; although proportions varied over time, prevalence among these youngest children was consistently higher than among children 5-14 years or adult respondents. Among children < 5 years, 44.3% experienced stunting, 41.1% underweight, 12.4% wasting, and 26.5% were anaemic. There was self-or carer-reported poor mental health among 16.6% of children aged 5-14 years and 13.9% of adult respondents. Rates of potential risky exposures from swimming in waterways, eating uncooked produce, and eating soil or dirt were high, as were exposures to flooding and livestock. Just over one third of households (35.3%) had access to municipal water, and contamination of well water with E. coli and nitrogen species was common. Most (79.5%) houses had an in-house toilet, but no houses were connected to a piped sewer network or safe, properly constructed septic tank. Median monthly settlement outdoor temperatures ranged from 26.2 degrees C to 29.3 degrees C, and were on average, 1.1 degrees C warmer inside houses than outside. Mosquito density varied over time, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 94.7% of species. Framed by a planetary health lens, our model includes four thematic domains: (1) the physical/built environment; (2) the ecological environment; (3) human health; and (4) socio-economic wellbeing, and is structured at individual, household, settlement, and city/beyond spatial scales. Conclusions: Our planetary health model includes key risk factors and faecal-oral exposure pathways but extends beyond conventional microbiological faecal-oral enteropathogen exposure pathways to comprehensively account for a wider range of variables affecting health in urban informal settlements. It includes broader ecological interconnections and planetary health-related variables at the household, settlement and city levels. It proposes a composite framework of markers to assess water and sanitation challenges and flood risks in urban informal settlements for optimal design and monitoring of interventions.

Tidally Driven Interannual Variation in Extreme Sea Level Frequencies in the Gulf of Maine	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						tides; coastal flooding; nodal cycle; extreme sea levels; gulf of Maine; joint probability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER LEVELS; TIDE; BOSTON; BAY; PROBABILITIES; FUNDY	Astronomical variations in tidal magnitude can strongly modulate the severity of coastal flooding on daily, monthly, and interannual timescales. Here we present a new quasi-nonstationary skew surge joint probability method (qn-SSJPM) that estimates interannual fluctuations in flood hazard caused by the 18.6- and quasi 4.4-year modulations of tides. We demonstrate that qn-SSJPM-derived storm tide frequency estimates are more precise and stable compared with the standard practice of fitting an extreme value distribution to measured storm tides, which is often biased by the largest few events within the observational period. Applying the qn-SSJPM in the Gulf of Maine, we find significant tidal forcing of winter storm season flood hazard by the 18.6-year nodal cycle, whereas 4.4-year modulations and a secular trend in tides are small compared to interannual variation and long-term trends in sea-level. The nodal cycle forces decadal oscillations in the 1% annual chance storm tide at an average rate of 13.5 mm/year in Eastport, ME; 4.0 mm/year in Portland, ME; and 5.9 mm/year in Boston, MA. Currently (in 2020), nodal forcing is counteracting the sea-level rise-induced increase in flood hazard; however, in 2025, the nodal cycle will reach a minimum and then begin to accelerate flood hazard increase as it moves toward its maximum phase over the subsequent decade. Along the world's meso-to-macrotidal coastlines, it is therefore critical to consider both sea-level rise and tidal nonstationarity in planning for the transition to chronic flooding that will be driven by sea-level rise in many regions over the next century. Plain Language Summary Coastal management practices around flood risk often rely on estimates of the percent chance of a particular flood height occurring within a year. For example, U.S. flood insurance requires designating areas with a 100-year flood recurrence interval (the "100-year flood zone"). When storms hit regions with large tides, the height and timing of high tide often determine flood severity. Thus, the relationship between flood height and annual frequency can be altered by natural, daily-to-decadal cyclical variation in tide heights. Here we present a new method for calculating annually varying flood height-frequency relationships based on known tidal cycles. Applying the new method in the Gulf of Maine, we find an 18.6-year-long tidal cycle (the nodal cycle) has forced decadal variation in the 1% annual chance flood at a faster rate than the historical average rate of sea-level rise over the past century. Currently, nodal cycle forcing is counteracting the sea-level rise-induced increase in flood hazard; however, in 2025, the nodal cycle will reach a minimum in the Gulf and then begin to accelerate flood hazard as it moves toward its maximum over the subsequent decade. It is therefore critical to consider sea-level rise and tidal variation in medium-term flood hazard planning. Key Points We present a new quasi-nonstationary joint probability method that estimates tidally driven interannual fluctuations in flood hazard This method provides more precise and stable storm tide frequency estimates than extreme value distributions fit to measured storm tides In the Gulf of Maine, tides force decadal oscillations in the 1% annual chance storm tide at a rate exceeding mean historical sea-level rise	[Baranes, H.

Human activities such as reservoir construction have greatly changed the state of runoff. In order to analyze the influence of Ganjiang Reservoir on the hydrological regime, the following paper is based on the daily precipitation data of 53 rainfall stations in Ganjiang River Basin from 1959 to 2016, and the daily runoff data of three stations in Dongbei, Ji'an, and Waizhou from 1959 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall test (MK) was used to analyze the trend of precipitation and runoff in Ganjiang River Basin. The Sliding t-Test (ST) was used to determine the abrupt change time of runoff in flood season within typical cross-sections of upper, middle, and lower reaches of Ganjiang River Basin, Ji'an, and Waizhou. Indicators of hydrological change (IHA), range of variability approach (RVA), and other methods were used to analyze the changes of 32 hydrological indicators in Ganjiang River Basin. The results showed that (1) The annual and flood season precipitation in Ganjiang River Basin increased from 1992 to 2016, but it did not reach a significant level. The change of annual runoff at Dongbei and Waizhou Stations was the same as that of the annual precipitation in Ganjiang River Basin. The runoff of Dongbei Station in flood season decreased from 1986 to 2016, and the runoff of Waizhou Railway Station in flood season decreased from 2008 to 2016. It showed that precipitation had a great influence on annual runoff, and human activities made the annual runoff distribution process more uniform; (2) The abrupt changes of runoff in flood season at three hydrological stations in Ganjiang River Basin occurred in 1991, and reached a significant level of 0.01; (3) There were five hydrological indicators of Dongbei Station which had reached height change. The change degree of low (l) pulse duration was -92.24%, the change degree of high (h) pulse count was -86.8%, the change degree of flow rise rate was 87.06%, the change degree of fall rate was -92.24%, and the change degree of number of reversals was -100%. Four hydrological indicators of Ji'an Station had reached high change degree, the count and duration of high pulse changes were -73.33% and -73.65%, the change degree of fall rate was -79%, and the change degree of number of reversals was -100%. Waizhou Station did not reach the high change indicator. The hydrological regime of the upper and middle reaches of Ganjiang River has changed greatly, while the hydrological regime of the lower reaches has changed little. The hydrological regime in the upper and middle reaches of Ganjiang River Basin has been highly changed by human activities such as dam construction. The change of hydrological conditions in the upper and middle reaches of Ganjiang River Basin may reduce the area of aquatic organisms' habitat, be harmful to the spawning, migration, and survival of aquatic organisms, reduce the interception of organic matter in floodplains, and increase the drought pressure of plants. The reservoir ecological operation of rivers with numerous reservoirs should be considered, joint reservoir dispatching schemes should be formulated for the study area so as to maximize the comprehensive benefits.

With the emergence of new, high-resolution analytical techniques, it has become possible to quickly examine the grain shape properties of a large number of individualmineral grains. In this study, we used automated image analysis (Malvern Morphologi G3SE-ID) to investigate mineral particles of four sediment types from different depositional environments (sand sheet (1), floodplain (2) and fluvial channel deposits (3), Pleistocene infilling material of sand wedges (4), n = 20) in the Carpathian Basin (Central Europe). Our primary objective was to identify quantitative key variables that can help objectively distinguish certain geomorphological environments located in the Carpathian Basin. In our analysis and data processing (which included techniques such as hierarchical cluster analysis, Wilks' lambda, Kruskal-Wallis, multivariate analysis of variance and principal component analysis) we focused on four variables related to grain shape: circularity (form), convexity (surface texture), solidity (roundness) and elongation (form). The form of sedimentary grains depends largely on the physical properties of their source area, while the roundness depends on the energy of the transportmedium and the distance of transportation. Surface texture or convexity can change in a relatively short time in a fluvial environment. The study revealed that distinguishing geomorphological environments can be achieved by analyzing the circularity, convexity and solidity parameters of the sediment grains. Based on the established grouping, the analyses carried out with hundred repetitions showed that high sensitivity circularity, convexity and solidity variables were the most effective attributes regarding Kruskal-Wallis test statistics that provided significant (p < 0.001) results between the analyzed sedimentary environments, while the elongation was not able to provide significant results between the grouped samples. Statistical analyses of theMANOVA test with hundredfold repetitions showed significant differences between the derived groups. Wilks' lambda test statistics and PCA showed that convexity and high sensitivity circularity discriminate the groups. Separate analyses of aeolian and fluvial sediments have been carried out. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance showed the significant differences considering all four variables, and differences were also significant in the case of the MANOVA test. Wilks'. test statistics and PCA showed that convexity, high sensitivity circularity and solidity discriminate the groups. According to our results, the circularity parameter can provide information about the transport distance, while the solidity parameter can indicate the transport energy. The convexity parameter can serve as an indicator of both transport distance, as well as post-depositional processes. Some infilling materials underwent multiple transport processes, including high energy aqueous, wind transport mechanisms, and the post-depositional alteration process (frost weathering), while others originated from sand-sheet covered areas (active during Pleistocene glacials). The solidity parameter proved effective in separating sediments with similarly high convexity values (smooth surface), whichwere, in our case, fromrecent aeolian and fluvial environments. This result was due to the investigated fluvial sediments that inherited their form and low level of roundness from their source area. Our research supports that aeolian transport is more effective in rounding the grains than the aqueous environment. Using automated static image analysis producing statistically stable resultswith hundreds of analyzedmineral grains provides useful indicators for paleogeographical reconstruction studies by investigating paleo and recent sediments.

What are the effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity in temperate regions? A systematic map	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE			English	Article						Dam; Evidence-based policy; Fish biomass; Fish abundance; Fish density; Flow modification; Hydroelectric; Reservoirs; River regulation; Stream	ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; DISTURBANCE; MANAGEMENT	Background There is growing evidence of the potential negative consequences of altered flow regimes, in terms of magnitude, frequency, timing, duration or season pattern, on fluvial ecosystems and the fisheries they support. The scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of the effects of flow alteration on fish productivity. We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers. Methods To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases, 29 organizational websites, one search engine, and 297 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources. We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient coverage for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps. Review findings A total of 1368 studies from 1199 articles were included in the systematic map database and used to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial trend design i.e., lacking a 'true' before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro), and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diversion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival, performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs). Conclusions This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of flow regime other than magnitude (e.g. , flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all interventions) affect population viability.

J	Baulon, L; Massei, N; Allier, D; Fournier, M; Bessiere, H				Baulon, Lisa; Massei, Nicolas; Allier, Delphine; Fournier, Matthieu; Bessiere, Helene			Influence of low-frequency variability on high and low groundwater levels: example of aquifers in the Paris Basin	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE VARIABILITY; NORTH-ATLANTIC; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; FRANCE; DROUGHTS; FLOOD; STREAMFLOW; CATCHMENT; DRIVERS; LINKS	Groundwater levels (GWLs) very often fluctuate over a wide range of timescales (intra-annual, annual, multiannual, and decadal). In many instances, aquifers act as low-pass filters, dampening the high-frequency variability and amplifying low-frequency variations (from multi-annual to decadal timescales) which basically originate from large-scale climate variability. Within the aim of better understanding and ultimately anticipating groundwater droughts and floods, it appears crucial to evaluate whether (and how much) the very high or very low GWLs are resulting from such low-frequency variability (LFV), which was the main objective of the study presented here. As an example, we focused on exceedance and non-exceedance of the 80 % and 20 % GWL percentiles respectively, in the Paris Basin aquifers over the 1976-2019 period. GWL time series were extracted from a database consisting of relatively undisturbed GWL time series regarding anthropogenic influence (water abstraction by either continuous or periodic pumping) over metropolitan France. Based on this dataset, our approach consisted in exploring the effect of GWL low-frequency components on threshold exceedance and non-exceedance by successively filtering out low-frequency components of GWL signals using maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). Multi-annual (similar to 7-year) and decadal (similar to 17-year) variabilities were found to be the predominant LFVs in GWL signals, in accordance with previous studies in the northern France area. By filtering out these components (either independently or jointly), it is possible to (i) examine the proportion of high-level (HL) and low-level (LL) occurrences generated by these variabilities and (ii) estimate the contribution of each of these variabilities in explaining the occurrence of major historical events associated with well-recognized societal impacts. A typology of GWL variations in Paris Basin aquifers was first determined by quantifying the variance distribution across timescales. Four GWL variation types could be found according to the predominance of annual, multiannual, or/and decadal variabilities in these signals: decadal-dominant (type iD), multi-annual- and decadal-dominant (type iMD), annual-dominant (type cA), and annual- and multi-annual-dominant (type cAM). We observed a clear dependence of high and low GWL on LFV for aquifers exhibiting these four GWL variation types. In addition, the respective contribution of multi-annual and decadal variabilities in the threshold exceedance varied according to the event. In numerous aquifers, it also appeared that the sensitivity to LFV was higher for LLs than HLs. A similar analysis was conducted on the only available long-term GWL time series which covered a hundred years. This allowed us to highlight the potential influence of multidecadal variability on HLs and LLs too. This study underlined the key role of LFV in the occurrence of HLs and LLs. Since LFV originates from large-scale stochastic climate variability as demonstrated in many previous studies in the Paris Basin or nearby regions, our results point out that (i) poor representation of LFV in general circulation model (GCM) outputs used afterwards for developing hydrological projections can result in strong uncertainty in the assessment of future groundwater extremes (GWEs), and (ii) potential changes in the amplitude of LFV, be they natural or induced by global climate change, may lead to substantial changes in the occurrence and severity of GWEs for the next decades. Finally, this study also stresses the fact that due to the stochastic nature of LFV, no deterministic prediction of future GWEs for the mid- or long-term horizons can be achieved, even though LFV may look periodic.

The terraces are progressively more folded with age and terrace elevation and present growth strata, suggesting ongoing folding of the anticline. Optically and InfraRed Stimulated Luminescence (OSL and IRSL) dating of fluvial terrace sediments yielded ages of 10.8 +/- 0.7 ka for the T2, 24.2 +/- 2 ka for the T4 and 46 +/- 9 ka for the T7 terrace. Uniform uplift rates of 2 mm a(-1) for the past 46 ka were calculated. Terrace profiles and two new seismic profiles that cross the Biabo anticline longitudinally and transversally were used to calculate shortening rates of 2.6 mm a(-1) for the anticline over the past 46 ka. Our calculations took into account potential contributions of detachment thrusting parallel to the Biabo fold and reverse tear faulting perpendicular to the fold tip as visible on the seismic sections. Amaximumuplift rate of 0.62 mm a(-1) due to reverse thrusting of the Bellavista tear fault for the past 46 ka could have contributed to the overall uplift of the Bellavista terraces. Based on trigonometric relationships, a reverse fault slip rate of 0.86 mm a(-1) and an age of 137 ka were calculated for this fault. In the eastern part of the Huallaga basin, a series of two fluvial terraceswere formed with elevations of 13-15 m and 30 m + FP and with OSL ages of 6.9 +/- 0.7 ka for T1 and 30.2 +/- 3.1 ka for T2. The interpretation of a third new seismic profile crossing the study area in combination with field observations and trigonometric relationships shows that the terraceswere formed by a complex system of oblique ramp and strike-slip faulting resulting in uplift and shortening rates of 1 mm a(-1) and 1.96 mm a(-1) between 30.2 ka and 6.9 ka respectively; and uplift and shortening rates of 2 mm a(-1) and 3.70 mm a(-1) from 6.9 ka until the present. Reverse slip of the Shapaja oblique ramp, that was responsible for uplift of the terraces, was calculated at 2.19 mm a(-1) for the period 30.2 to 6.9 ka and 4.15 mm a(-1) from 6.9 ka until the present. Measured total slip in combination with the calculated slip rates allowed an age calculation of 181 ka for the Shapaja thrust ramp. Our inferences showed that the studied tectonic structures absorb most of the present-day deformation in the Huallaga basin. The calculated uplift and shortening rates are compatible with published, present-day crustal movement velocities, and Miocene to present shortening rates for various, studied sites of the tropical Subandes and suggest that it is deforming at a relatively uniform rate. The timing of sedimentation of the terrace sediments may have corresponded to periods of increased precipitation which occurred coeval with the Heinrich events of the Northern Hemisphere. Terrace records similar as ours have been described for other, tectonically highly active areas in the tropical Subandes, but not in the tectonically less active Amazonian lowlands. It is suggested that uplift rates of at least 1 mm a(-1) are needed to preserve suborbital climate cycles as individual terraces. The tropical Subandes could therefore be a new key area to investigate the interactions between tectonics, suborbital climate forcing and fluvial response during the late Quaternary.

High resolution multi-annual riverine fluxes of organic carbon, nutrient and trace element from the largest European Arctic river, Severnaya Dvina	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article							RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; FLUVIAL GEOCHEMISTRY; EASTERN SIBERIA; WATER CHEMISTRY; RUSSIAN RIVERS; MAJOR ELEMENTS; SILICATE ROCKS; BOREAL RIVERS; LAPTEV SEA; TRENDS	Assessing multi-annual riverine export fluxes of carbon, nutrients and metals from the continent to the Arctic Ocean is crucial for constraining the current status and foreseeing future changes in riverine export induced by climate change. Over 3 consecutive years (2012-2014), we measured daily to weekly concentrations of C, N, P, all major and 45 trace elements (TE) in filtered (< 0.45 mu m) river water at the terminal station of Severnaya Dvina, the largest European Arctic river, gauged since 1882. There were 3 main groups of elements according to their seasonal behavior, demonstrating distinct links between concentration and the discharge. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), major anions (Cl, SO4), alkali and alkaline-earth elements (Li, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Rb, Sr, Ba), and oxyanions (B, Mo, Ge, As) and U exhibited minimum concentrations during spring flood and autumn high flow events, being significantly (p < 0.01) negatively correlated with discharge and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. These elements reflected the dominant lithology of Severnaya Dvina watershed (carbonates, gypsum) and were controlled by dilution of underground (baseflow) influx by floods. The concentration of DOC, low-soluble trace elements (Al, Ti, Ga, Y, rare earth elements, Zr, Nb, Hf, Th) and organically-bound metals (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb) had the maximum at the spring flood peak. The input of these elements to the river occurred via surface flow and they were significantly (p < 0.01) increasing with water discharge. Finally, N, P, Si, Mn and Fe originated from both surface and underground sources and were impacted by autochthonous biotic processes in the river channel; they exhibited a strong winter maximum and a summer minimum. The spring flood (May and June) provided 50% of overall water and DOC, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sb, and Pb flux and 60% of low-soluble TE (Al, Y, Nb, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf and Th). The nutrients (K, Rb, Si, P, N) exhibited around 40% share of annual export during spring flood, whereas the export of soluble mobile elements (DIC, Cl-, SO42-, Li, B, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Mo and U) mainly occurred during winter (35-40%) with only 20-25% of annual flow provided by spring flood. The 3-year mean export fluxes of dissolved components were 30 to 50% lower than (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb) or comparable to (+/- 30% for all other elements including DOC and for DIC) previous estimates of this river from 2007 to 2008 and the historic data of major components from 1930 to 1950. In particular, there was no trend in mean monthly seasonal and annual concentrations and export fluxes of DOC, DIC, SO4, Cl since the beginning of chemical analysis between 1929 and 1930 and in Ca, Mg, Si, and Fe since the 1950's through the duration of this study (2012-2014). The lack of seasonal and annual increases in discharge, carbon, and element concentrations in the permafrost-free Severnaya Dvina River for > 120 years of discharge and over 60 years of chemical composition measurements is at odds with the reported short-term trend (based on measurements that began in 1970s) showing that element export fluxes increased in other Arctic rivers due to on-going climate warming and permafrost thaw. Novelty statement: Historical and contemporary measurements of element fluxes in the largest European Arctic river did not reveal sizeable changes in discharge and DOC, DIC, Ca, Mg, Fe, Si, SO4, Cl concentrations and fluxes over past > 60 years.

Export of organic carbon, nutrients and metals by the mid-sized Pechora River to the Arctic Ocean	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Organic carbon; Trace element; Yield; Permafrost; Peatland; Colloid; Arctic	FIELD-FLOW FRACTIONATION; WESTERN SIBERIAN RIVERS; RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; IRON-RICH NANOCOLLOIDS; TRACE-ELEMENTS; PERMAFROST THAW; ALASKAN RIVERS; MAJOR ELEMENTS; SILICATE ROCKS; BOREAL RIVER	In contrast to good knowledge of export fluxes of carbon and metals from mainland to the Arctic Ocean by large Arctic Rivers, information on mid-sized rivers is limited, which prevents determining current status and foreseeing future changes in riverine export induced by climate change. Here we focused on one of the 'middle eight' Arctic rivers. The Pechora River (S-watershed = 322,000 km(2)) is the second largest European Arctic river draining through boreal forest and peatlands with partial (similar to 40%) permafrost coverage. Over 4 consecutive years (2015-2019), we measured weekly to monthly concentrations of carbon, major nutrients, and 40 major and trace elements in filtered (< 0.45 mu m) river water at the terminal gauging stations for the Pechora River. The dependences between dissolved element concentration and river discharge over the full period of observation revealed 3 groups of major and trace solutes according to their seasonal behavior. Group 1 was comprised of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), major anions (Cl, SO4), alkalis (Li, Na, K, Rb), alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), elements present in the form of labile anions and neutral molecules (B, Si, Ge, Mo, Sb) and U. It demonstrated minimal concentrations during spring flooding and autumn high flow events, and maximal concentrations during winter base flow. Concentrations of these element negatively correlated with discharge. These elements primarily reflected the dominant sedimentary lithology of the Pechora catchment and were controlled by influx of underground waters hosted in carbonate rocks. Group 2 included DOC and low-mobility trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates (Be, Al, Ga, Y, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) and some trace metals (V, Cr, Cs, Nb). The transport of these elements to the river from the catchment likely occurred via surface and shallow subsurface waters due to leaching from organic-rich litter layer, and their concentrations positively correlated with discharge. Finally, group 3 involved major- (P, N, K) and micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) and demonstrated features of both the 1st and 2nd groups as these elements originated from surface (organic-rich) and underground (sedimentary rock-hosted) sources and were removed by autochthonous biotic processes in the water column. As a result, the concentration of these nutrients exhibited a winter maximum and a summer minimum. Similar to other Arctic and subarctic rivers, the spring flood, which lasted from May to June, accounted for >50% of the annual export of DOC and generally insoluble trace metals. However, the winter baseflow provided sizable proportions of mobile elements such as DIC, major anions, cations, alkaline-earth elements, trace oxy-anions and uranium. The size distribution of riverine solutes demonstrated 20-50% of DOC in the colloidal (3 kDa - 0.45 mu m) form, dominance of low molecular forms (< 3 kDa) of soluble elements (alkali, alkaline earths, anions and neutral molecules) and essentially colloidal status of divalent metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni), trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates and U (from 30 to 93%). Seasonal variations in colloidal fractions of riverine solutes were consistent with the main mechanisms of element mobilization from the watershed to the Pechora River, as reflected in the 3 groups of elements according to their concentration - discharge relationship. Based on the present study and results of other mid-sized Arctic rivers (Severnaya Dvina, Taz), we demonstrate that mean discharges and solute concentrations in August can be used to adequately (+/- 20%) approximate mean annual values, hence allowing annual flux assessment via single month sampling campaign. A comparison of contemporary yields of Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4, DIC and DOC against historical data for the Pechora River basin demonstrated reasonable agreement within the inter-annual variations that is consistent with long-term data series on other Arctic rivers.

Climate-related shocks and other stressors associated with depression and anxiety in Bangladesh: a nationally representative panel study	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; WORLD	Background Climate change has major implications for common mental disorders including depression and anxiety in vulnerable nations such as Bangladesh. However, knowledge gaps exist around national estimations of depression and anxiety, and the associations between the prevalence of these disorders with climate-related and sociodemographic risk factors. To address these gaps, this study analysed data from a nationally representative panel study in Bangladesh that examined climate-related and sociodemographic correlates of depression and anxiety. Methods Two rounds of nationally representative household panel data were collected from urban and rural areas between August and September, 2019, and January and February, 2020. Households were selected for inclusion across 150 enumeration areas as the primary sampling units with use of a two-stage stratified random sampling design, and survey instruments were administered to the available adult member of the household. Depression and anxiety were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scales, respectively, and weighted prevalence estimates were calculated on the basis of the 2011 national population census. Data on temperature and humidity were collected from 43 weather stations and constructed as mean values for the 2-month period preceding each round of the survey. Self-reported exposure to flooding was collected for a 12-month recall period. We applied a weighted population average logistic model on the pooled sample of both surveys to analyse the associations between ambient temperature, humidity, exposure to flooding, seasonality, sociodemographic variables, and three outcome conditions (depression, anxiety, and co-occurring depression and anxiety; at the level of p<0.1). The models accounted for temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Standard errors were clustered at the level of each primary sampling unit. Findings 3606 individuals were included with 3.5% dropout in the second survey round (pooled sample n=7086; age range 15-90 years; 2898 [40.9%] men and 4188 [59.1%] women). National weighted prevalence estimates were 16.3% (95% CI 14.7-17.8) for depression, 6.0% (4.7-7.3) for anxiety, and 4.8% (3.7-5.9) for co-occurring depression and anxiety. We observed no significant associations between overall seasonality (summer vs winter) and the odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio 3.14 [95% CI 0.52-19.13], p=0.22), anxiety (0.16 [0.02-1.41], p=0.10), or co-occurring depression and anxiety (0.13 [0.01-1.49], p=0.10). An increase in mean temperature of 1 degrees C within the 2 months preceding the surveys was associated with increased odds of anxiety (1.21 [1.00-1.47], p=0.046) and increased odds of co-occurring depression and anxiety (1.24 [1.00-1.53], p=0.045), whereas increased temperature was not associated with depression (0.90 [0.77-1.04], p=0.15). An increase in mean humidity of 1 g/m(3) was not associated with depression (0.99 [0.96-1.02], p=0.60) or anxiety (1.04 [0.99-1.09], p=0.13), but was associated with co-occurring depression and anxiety (1.06 [1.00-1.12], p=0.064). Exposure to flooding within the 12 months preceding the survey rounds was associated with increased odds of all outcome conditions (depression, 1.31 [1.00-1.70], p=0.047; anxiety, 1.69 [1.21-2.36], p=0.0020; and co-occurring depression and anxiety, 1.87 [1.31-2.68], p=0.0006). Interpretation Climate-related shocks and other stressors have an important association with the burden of depression and anxiety in Bangladesh. Community-level interventions for common mental disorders need to be developed and assessed for safety, feasibility, and effectiveness in a Bangladeshi context. Further research on climate-related stressors is needed over different timespans and time intervals. Copyright (C) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to analyse the causal processes of social vulnerability to flood impacts from a relational perspective. To this end, a social network analysis was performed that identified the conditions and causes of social vulnerability and systematically articulated the relationships between them. This analysis was tested on the specific case of flood risk on the coast of the province of Alicante (SE Spain). To ascertain the conditions and causes of social vulnerability to flood risk, a multidisciplinary group of local experts was consulted, and the resulting data processed in a relational way using Atlas.ti and Gephi softwares. The result was a social vulnerability network comprising 84 nodes and 189 edges distributed into four dimensions: the adaptive capacity of tourists, socio-economic structure, land use planning and risk management. The information was ranked for betweenness centrality, revealing the components with highest causal power of social vulnerability to social impacts in flooding events: low flood risk awareness, economic growth based on real estate boom, property speculation and lack of political interest in flood risk management. This proposal places emphasis on the driving forces of social vulnerability and not exclusively on the specific adaptive conditions of the population, which allows a strategic identification and management of generative forces that ultimately induce the social impacts of floods. L'approche dominante de la vulnerabilite sociale aux risques d'inondation est confrontee a certains defis concernant sa capacite a traiter la complexite des processus de causalite. L'objectif de notre etude est d'analyser d'un point de vue relationnel les processus qui produisent la vulnerabilite sociale dans les impacts des inondations. A cette fin, nous proposons une analyse des reseaux sociaux qui identifie et articule systematiquement les relations entre les conditions et les causes de la vulnerabilite sociale. Cette analyse est testee dans le cas specifique du risque d'inondation sur la cote de la province d'Alicante (sud-est de l'Espagne). Afin de comprendre les conditions et les causes de la vulnerabilite sociale au risque d'inondation, un groupe multidisciplinaire d'experts locaux a ete consulte et les donnees obtenues ont ete traitees de maniere relationnelle a l'aide des logiciels Atlas.ti et Gephi. Le resultat est un reseau de vulnerabilite sociale compose de 84 n oe uds et 189 aretes et distribue en 4 dimensions: capacite d'adaptation des touristes, structure socio-economique, planification de l'utilisation des terres et gestion des risques. Les informations ont ete classees en fonction de la centralite de la relation entre les n oe uds, revelant les composantes ayant le plus grand pouvoir causal de vulnerabilite aux impacts sociaux en cas d'inondations: faible sensibilisation au risque d'inondation, croissance economique basee sur le boom immobilier, speculation immobiliere et manque d'interet politique pour la gestion du risque d'inondation. Cette proposition met l'accent sur les forces motrices de la vulnerabilite sociale et non exclusivement sur les conditions d'adaptation specifiques de la population, ce qui permet une identification et une gestion strategiques des forces motrices qui induisent en fin de compte les impacts sociaux des inondations. El enfoque dominante de la vulnerabilidad social ante el riesgo de inundaciones se enfrenta a algunos retos relativos a su capacidad para abordar la complejidad de los procesos causales. El objetivo de nuestro estudio es analizar desde una perspectiva relacional los procesos que producen vulnerabilidad social en los efectos de las inundaciones. Para ello se plantea un analisis de redes sociales que identifica y articula sistematicamente las relaciones entre las condiciones y las causas de la vulnerabilidad social. Este analisis se pone a prueba en el caso concreto del riesgo de inundaciones en la costa de la provincia de Alicante (Sudeste de Espana). Para conocer las condiciones y causas de la vulnerabilidad social ante el riesgo de inundaciones, se consulto a un grupo multidisciplinar de expertos locales y los datos resultantes fueron procesados de forma relacional empleando los softwares Atlas.ti y Gephi. El resultado fue una red de vulnerabilidad social compuesta por 84 nodos y 189 aristas y distribuida en 4 dimensiones: la capacidad de adaptacion de los turistas, la estructura socioeconomica, la planificacion del uso del suelo y la gestion del riesgo. La informacion se clasifico segun la centralidad de la relacion entre nodos, revelando los componentes con mayor potencia causal de la vulnerabilidad a los impactos sociales en caso de inundaciones: escasa concienciacion sobre el riesgo de inundaciones, crecimiento economico basado en el boom inmobiliario, especulacion inmobiliaria y falta de interes politico en la gestion del riesgo de inundaciones. Esta propuesta pone el enfasis en las fuerzas motrices de la vulnerabilidad social y no exclusivamente en las condiciones adaptativas especificas de la poblacion, lo que permite una identificacion y gestion estrategica de las fuerzas generadoras que en ultima instancia inducen los impactos sociales de las inundaciones.

J	Zwarts, L; Bijlsma, RG; van der Kamp, J				Zwarts, Leo; Bijlsma, Rob G.; van der Kamp, Jan			The fortunes of migratory birds from Eurasia: being on a tightrope in the Sahel	ARDEA			English	Article						Sahel; drought; land use; trends in bird populations	PALEARCTIC PASSERINE MIGRANTS; WARBLERS ACROCEPHALUS-SCHOENOBAENUS; VULTURE NECROSYRTES-MONACHUS; DOVES STREPTOPELIA-TURTUR; TERM POPULATION DECLINES; STORK CICONIA-CICONIA; WEST-AFRICAN RAINFALL; SAND MARTIN RIPARIA; LONG-TERM; SURVIVAL RATES	Many studies have shown that rainfall in the Sahel has a great influence on population trends of European bird species that spend the northern winter there. African bird species living in the Sahel, notably those that forage on the ground, have also shown significant declines, but independent of rainfall. This paper summarises the results of field data gathered in the entire Sahel and evaluates the many factors that play a role in the fortunes of birds. (1) Rainfall determines the extent of open water in the Sahel, and by default the fortunes of waterbirds. In recent decades the surface area of open water has increased because water tables have risen. (2) Rainfall south of the Sahel determines river discharge and therefore the surface of floodplains in the Sahel. Rainfall has a cumulative effect: discharges disproportionally decrease after a number of years with little rain, and vice versa. During the dry season (October-May), floodplains gradually dry out. In wet years, water - and hence food - is available for birds up to their departure, but in dry years birds become concentrated at the few remaining pools and so present an easy target for bird-trappers. Further desiccation leads to starvation. (3) After a year with heavy rainfall, seed is available in abundance, but a dry year results in a shift in the plant community and a low seed supply. Mortality among seedeaters increases under dry conditions. (4) In dry years, trees lose their leaves early on, forcing arboreal birds into a diminishing number of trees that retain leaves. In extremely dry years trees die on a massive scale and it takes many years before tree coverage is restored. When droughts occur in quick succession, as in 1972/73 and again in 1984/85, tree recovery is slow and populations of arboreal birds will continue to decline, or recover slowly or only partly (as for Eurasian Wryneck Jynx torquilla and Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, whose numbers remain reduced by tenfold when compared to the 1950s, despite a slight recovery). Rainfall in the Sahel gradually recovered after 1990, as did the woody vegetation albeit with a delay, and many migratory bird species responded accordingly. Subalpine Warblers Curruca subalpina and Western Orphean Warblers Curruca hortensis have increased as much as threefold to fivefold since 1990. Southern European bird species, wintering in the arid parts of southern Sahara and Sahel, were hit the hardest during the Great Drought in 1969-1992, but also recovered the fastest, particularly strongly once rainfall had significantly recovered. Despite clear links between migratory birds and rainfall-related variables in their wintering areas, a migrant's world is more complicated than exclusively being constrained by rainfall. In the past century, the human population in subSaharan Africa has increased tenfold, with far-reaching consequences. (1) Cattle numbers boomed and grazing pressure increased greatly. Heavy grazing means lower grass seed production, especially of seeds that birds prefer. The steep decline of granivorous birds over the past several decades is therefore no surprise. (2) Every year, 2% of the savannah is converted into farmland. This is unfavourable for most, but not all, bird species. Farmers selectively favour particular tree species on their land (and remove the rest), by which the resulting tree species composition differs from the typical variety found in savannah. The shift in tree composition particularly disfavours birds wintering in both the more arid and more humid vegetation zones. Arboreal birds wintering in the intermediate zone have benefitted from the expansion of farming, because their preferred tree (White Thorn Faidherbia albida) is favoured by farmers and has become more abundant. (3) The expansion of agriculture is most obvious in the low-lying, slightly more humid and more fertile soils, much to the detriment of flooded forests, which being important refuges during droughts are particularly rich in birds. Most flooded forests have disappeared from the Sahel. (4) Millions of hectares of humid woody savannah have been converted into Cashew Anacardium occidentale plantations since 1980. Cashew plantations are almost completely devoid of birds and so constitute a significant loss of a once highly diverse wooded habitat. (5) The proliferation of Prosopis juliflora, an exotic tree species resembling an acacia, has locally and regionally displaced indigenous acacia species. Prosopis attracts few birds in comparison with acacias. (6) Irrigation and dam construction have decimated the size of floodplains in Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and Chad, with corresponding effects on many bird species, especially waterbirds, that concentrate in these areas. (7) Massive bird catches, such as those in the Inner Niger Delta after about 1990, did not occur in the past when cheap nylon nets (initially used for fishing) were not yet available. Furthermore, storage and transportation of trapped birds were impossible until ice and vehicles became available. (8) Large bird species have virtually disappeared from the Sahel due to human predation, especially in the densely populated western part. As a wintering area for most migratory Eurasian birds, the Sahel has become less attractive. Far fewer migratory birds now use the Sahel than half a century ago, not least because many populations have substantially declined in numbers. Furthermore, several European migrant species increasingly are wintering north of the Sahara, which may relate to impoverished conditions in the Sahel, but as likely to significant habitat changes in Europe and the pace of climate change.

We gratefully remember the villagers for their hospitality, the farmers who allowed us to walk (and camp) in their fields, and policemen and soldiers who often worried about our safety and always were correct and helpful. The work would not have been possible without the support of Eddy Wymenga (A&W) and Bernd de Bruijn (Vogelbescherming Nederland -BirdLife in The Netherlands). We are fortunate that Dick Visser was available to improve our graphs and maps. We are grateful to Ian Newton and Theunis Piersma who commented on the manuscripts, and Mike Blair who polished our English.
