Natural hazards are involuntary risk environments (e.g., flooded roads); interaction with them cannot be avoided (i.e., a decision must be made about how to engage). While the psychological and sociocultural predictors of engagement with voluntary risks (i.e., risk situations that are sought out) are well-documented, less is known about the factors that predict engagement with involuntary risk environments. This exploratory study assessed whether mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms), personality traits, and cultural worldviews combine to predict engagement with involuntary risk, using the situation of floodwater driving. An Australian sample (N = 235) was assessed via questionnaire and scenario measures. Results were analyzed in a binomial logistic regression assessing which individual factors predicted decision-making in a proxy floodwater driving scenario. Agreeableness and gender were individually significant predictors of floodwater driving intention, and four factors (named "affect," "progressiveness," "insightfulness," and "purposefulness") were derived from an exploratory factor analysis using the variables of interest, though only two ("progressiveness" and "insightfulness") predicted floodwater driving intention in an exploratory binomial logistic regression. The findings highlight the need for further research into the differences between voluntary and involuntary risk. The implication of cultural worldviews and personality traits in interaction with mental health indicators on risk situations is discussed.

Agricultural patterns have been changing significantly and causing many impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in the upper Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Therefore, this study aims to evaluate how typical agricultural pattern changes are affecting SOC by estimating the SOC stock and identifying the correlation with soil physic-chemical properties. Soil samples were collected in both depths of 0-20 cm and 20-50 cm and analyzed physic-chemical properties such as soil texture, bulk density, pHKCl, EC and SOC. In topsoil layers, the SOC stock of the wetland forest was the highest in the opened depression of floodplain (24.42 +/- 1.38 kg C m(-2); p<0.05) while that of paddy rice was the richest at depth of 20-50 cm (27.69 +/- 2.97 kg C m(-2); p<0.05). In other agro-ecological areas, SOC stock in croplands was lower than forest and grassland in topsoil layer, especially in mountainous areas. SOC stock correlated positively with SOC content, clay, bulk density, and EC (p<0.05) but had a negative correlation with sand and pHKCl (p<0.05). The decrease in SOC stock in dry cultivating patterns indicated the impact of agricultural management practices and soil fertility on SOC storage. Thus, improving SOC stock	[Nguyen Thi Hai Ly] Dong Thap Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 783 Pham Huu Lau St, Cao Lanh City 870000, Dong Thap, Vietnam; [Nguyen Thi Phuong; Ho Nguyen] Dong Thap Univ, Dept Land Management, 783 Pham Huu Lau St, Cao Lanh City 870000, Dong Thap, Vietnam; [Anh, Lu n T.] Dong Map Univ, Div Biol, 783 Pham Huu Lau St, Cao Lanh City 870000, Dong Thap, Vietnam; [Nguyet, Dang Anh] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Ho Nguyen] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Heisenbergstr 2, D-48149 Munster, Germany	Victoria University Wellington; University of Munster	Ly, NTH (corresponding author), Dong Thap Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 783 Pham Huu Lau St, Cao Lanh City 870000, Dong Thap, Vietnam.	nthly@dthu.edu.vn	Ly, Nguyen Thi Hai/ABQ-6850-2022	Ly, Nguyen Thi Hai/0000-0002-2644-2902; Nguyen, Ho/0000-0002-2991-0011	 [B2021]		This research is supported by the Project B2021.

Since similar to 9500 cal yr BP, the proxy records of chemical weathering from the Yangtze River basin generally exhibit a Holocene optimum in the early Holocene, a weak East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) period during the middle Holocene, and a relatively strong EASM period in the late Holocene. The similar to 8.2 and similar to 4.4 cal ka BP cooling events are recorded in core ECS0702. The flooding events reconstructed by the grain-size parameters since the early Holocene suggest that the floods mainly occurred during strong EASM periods and the Yangtze River mouth sandbar caused by the floods mainly formed in the early and late Holocene. The Yangtze River-mouth sandbars since the early Holocene shifted from north to south, affected by tidal currents and the Coriolis force, and more importantly, controlled by the EASM. Our results are of great significance for enriching both the record of Holocene climate change in the Yangtze River basin and knowledge about the formation and evolution progress of the deltas located in monsoon regions.

This work presents a reliable method to easily identify current and future hazard hotspots on sandy beaches in monitored coastal areas. Hotspots are defined as areas with high erosion and flooding hazard, which require detailed further study. The methodology is based into the application of WAPO (Wave Propagation On the Coast) model and DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) tool. WAPO model propagates monochromatic wave trains over a variable bottom and extracts the energy flux on the coast, taking into account refraction, diffraction, shoaling, reflection and energy dissipation. DSAS tool calculates rates of shoreline change from multiple historical shoreline positions. The method was applied in La Atunara beach in the South of Spain, influenced by the presence of anthropic structures and a complex bathymetry. Wave data used in the models were extracted by a joint probability analysis of wave height, period and direction for modal and storm conditions in the zone. Additionally, synthetic cases were generated for assessing climate change impact by modifying mean sea level parameters according to the IPCC scenarios. Results show that this methodology provides a simplified assessment of hotspots that allows focusing on the most vulnerable areas. This avoids the use of more complex and time-consuming models in large areas, allowing efforts to be concentrated on the identified hotspots.

However, the maize yields reported in most SSA countries are very low and this is mainly attributed to biotic and abiotic stresses. These stresses have been exacerbated by climate change which has led to long periods of drought or heavy flooding and the emergence of new biotic stresses. Few reports exist which compile the biotic stresses affecting maize production in SSA. Here, five major biotic stresses of maize in Kenya are presented which are attributed to high yield losses. They include Maize lethal necrosis, fall armyworm, gray leaf spot, turcicum leaf blight and desert locusts. Maize lethal necrosis and fall armyworm are new biotic stresses to the Kenyan maize farmer while gray leaf spot, and turcicum leaf blight are endemic to the region. The invasion by the desert locusts is speculated to be caused by climate change. The biotic stresses cause a reduction in maize yield of 30-100% threatening food security. Therefore, this review focuses on the cause, control measures employed to control these diseases and future prospective. There should be deliberate efforts from the government and researchers to control biotic stresses affecting maize yields as the effect of these stresses is being exacerbated by the changing climate.

Collembola community contains larger species in frequently flooded soil	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Collembola; Soil fauna; Flooding intensity; Traits; Floodplains; Drought; Inundation; Grassland	DESICCATION RESISTANCE; EXTREME; TRAITS; DIVERSITY; DROUGHT; FAUNA; RIVER; RICHNESS; EVENTS; VULNERABILITY	Climate change is increasingly affecting biotic communities, including soil fauna. Extreme weather events such as the incidence of heavy rainfall or prolonged drought can cause strong fluctuations in soil moisture. In river floodplains such extreme events determine the flooding intensity of the river bank grassland soils, and their communities. The diversity and distribution of many soil fauna groups depends on soil moisture content, so changes in inundation frequency and duration will impact soil fauna communities. We used the natural fluc-tuations in water levels of large Dutch rivers to investigate the effect of flooding intensity on the composition and traits of Collembola species, a key group of the soil fauna community. At five locations along large rivers in The Netherlands, we sampled Collembola communities at six levels of decreasing elevation and increasing flooding intensity. We identified all Collembola to species level and calculated species richness, composition and abun-dance values. Moreover, to understand the observed taxonomic changes across elevation we used the traits body size and life form to explain the change in Collembola community composition. Our results show that high flooding intensity favors larger Collembola species in the community. We hypothesize that high soil moisture in frequently flooded soil favors larger Collembola, which tolerate flooding. Life form, i.e. the preferred depth in the soil column, was significantly correlated with flooding intensity. There is an optimum in species richness and abundance at intermediate flooding intensity. These results can help predict the impact of climate change on soil fauna.	[Krediet, A. F.; Ellers, J.; Berg, M.

Flood management is widely recognized as an effective way to reduce the adverse consequences, and a more resilient and sustainable flood management approach has been the goal in recent studies. This study used a detailed bibliometric analysis of keywords, terms and timelines in the research field of the flood research. It provides new insight into the flood research trends, by examining the research frontiers from 2000 to 2021. We conclude that the trend of flood research has experienced a transition from flood control to flood resilience. The review shows that flood research has moved from traditional flood management, which provides mitigation strategies, to flood risk management, which provides an adaptation approach-adjusting mitigation measures, to flood resilience management, which provides a more resilient and sustainable plan to cope with flood disasters. We also present a detailed overview of the field of flood research, and review the definition of risk, risk analysis methods, flood management, flood risk management, flood resilience, and corresponding implementation strategies. We conclude that integrating the concept of resilience into the framework of risk management is a better approach in future flood management directions. Consequently, appropriate options and decisions prior to disaster, during disaster, and post-disaster will effectively reduce the adverse consequences using the theory of risk, resilience, and sustainability.

However, federal buyout programs are widely critiqued for being inaccessible and inequitable. To learn whether and how subnational buyout programs overcome these limitations, we examined five leading US state, county, and local buyout programs to see what they teach us about redesigning future federal policies. Our mixed-methods research used interviews and document analysis to develop case studies, juxtaposed subnational strategies against a review of critiques of federal buyouts, and focus group discussions with subnational buyout managers and experts to identify limitations of their programs. We find that subnational programs can be more inclusive and better respond to resident needs as compared to existing federal programs due to their access to dedicated, non-federal funding and their standing institutional status, which allows them to learn and evolve over time. Nevertheless, these programs lack coordination with and control over agencies that permit development and produce affordable housing. This gives buyout programs limited power in shaping the overall equity of who lives in floodplains and who has access to affordable, resilient housing after a buyout. Their experiences suggest federal programs can support managed retreat nationwide by increasing support for institutional and staff capacity at state and county levels, encouraging efforts to bridge institutional silos at subnational levels, and holistically mainstream climate considerations into regional floodplain development, affordable housing production, and flood risk mitigation.

In order to determine main drivers of nonstationary changes of Weihe River runoff, a de-nonstationarity method is used to remove the nonstationary influence of the potential driving factors and transform the nonstationary annual runoff series into a stationary reconstructed series. Then, the primary causes of the nonstationarity are identified by determining which factor results in the most stationary reconstructed series. The climate change factors (annual precipitation and annual average temperature) and the human activity factors (irrigation area and reservoir index) are selected as the reconstructed factors. The attribution results demonstrate that (1) both temperature rises and human activities have a significant impact on the nonstationary change, (2) the temperature is the most significant contributor to the nonstationary change in the annual runoff, which has a nonlinear impact on the first and second moments, (3) the influence of reservoir index is relatively smaller than irrigation area without considering the regulation rule, (4) the stationary precipitation series still exerts some impacts on the second moment of the annual runoff, (5) the temperature and irrigation area have some overlapped influence on annual runoff because the synchronous increase trend in the two series leads to a certain correlation between them, and the temperature rise may also lead to the adjustment of irrigation planning and management.

Predicting the impact of climate change on urban drainage systems in northwestern Italy by a copula-based approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Bivariate distributions; Copula functions; Climate change; Seasonal non-stationarities; Flood frequency; Urban drainage systems	PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; TAIL-DEPENDENCE; COSMO-CLM; RAINFALL; FREQUENCY; TEMPERATURE; MODELS; TRENDS; SIMULATIONS	Study region: Milan, northwestern Italy. Study focus: The impact of expected trends in storm temporal structures is analyzed with reference to urban drainage systems, featuring catchment areas spanning from 10 ha to 100 ha. A bivariate stochastic model for the derivation of flood frequency is developed, accounting for the seasonality of storm volumes, durations and their mutual dependence structure. Its reliability is verified by comparing it to continuous hydrodynamic simulations. To do so, a 21-year long series observed at Milan-Monviso raingauge was used. Model comparison evidences a satisfactory agreement between models. New hydrological insights for the region: Although the total annual precipitation is not expected to change, relevant increases in flood frequencies are predicted. Such increases vary between 10-20 % and appear to be independent of the return period. Thus, great concerns arise for the existing urban drainage systems located in northwestern Italy, which should basically be unable to face these flood frequency changes. A leading role is played by the intensification of summer and spring storms, both in terms of increase in volumes and decrease in durations. Moreover, changes in the dependence structure have a significant impact when summer storms are considered. Conversely, flood frequency curves are far less sensitive to the storm temporal structures featuring other seasons. These results can be explained by considering the seasonal distribution of storms critical for urban drainage systems.

It is a crucial step towards risk mitigation and adaptation planning to evaluate and predict flood disaster risk. In this study, a model coupling ontology and Bayesian Network that can capture the potential relationships between different factors influencing flood disaster and has capable of quantifying uncertainty and utilizing both data and observations was proposed. Based on the proposed model, the flood disaster risk in Zhengzhou City was assessed, which was validated by comparing with actual historical flood records. And the sensitivity analysis was carried out based on this model to determine that which factors would affect the disaster most. The results show that 72.3% of the study area was characterized by very-high to moderate flood disaster risk, which was mainly located in the central and eastern regions. The sensitivity analysis show that the rainfall duration is the most impactful factor, and the factors related to disaster-formative environment have low effect. The results revealed quite good agreement between the predicted flood disaster risk with actual flood records, which can be useful to assist flood mitigation and management. The model proposed in this study offers the Zhengzhou City and flood researches around the world, an effective way for evaluating flood disaster risk to manage uncertainty in water availability under climate change.

In this study, we define this situation as a 'wicked problem' and suggest a 'green paradiplomacy'-based framework that fosters multiactor, multiscale collaboration across jurisdictions as a management strategy. We interviewed stakeholders and combined their perceptions with currently employed management strategies to assess the potential for green paradiplomacy to address the Devils Lake problem. This study may encourage further discussion of green paradiplomacy as a strategy to manage other transboundary watershed problems along the US-Canada border and elsewhere.

Colombia is exposed to extreme climate changes and the consequences of these periods of climate change are drought, erosion, salinization, floods, sedimentation and alteration of ecosystems. As a result, the livestock industry experiences significant losses due to damaged feed and reduction in productivity and reproductivity of agricultural animals. The objective of this work is to determine the global bioprospective potential of macroalgae as nutritional supplements for ruminants and their potential application in the Colombian Caribbean area. For this, a quantitative and longitudinal documentary research design was used. An exploratory bibliographical review was carried out to explain the interactions between the variables applying the PRISMA protocol. The analysis of the changes in production variables of the ruminants supplemented with macroalgae was carried out by comparing the data of the treatment groups with their respective control groups in cattle, goats and sheep. For cattle, data by algal phylum showed that brown and red macroalgae increased average daily weight gain. Data by phylum and family of algae associated with milk production showed a positive impact of dietary supplementation with macroalgae on milk production, particularly with green and red algae. In the present study, it has been confirmed that red macroalgae is the best option to produce feed supplements for ruminants because they increase milk and meat production and show a statistically significant reduction in enteric methane production in cattle. For the Colombian Caribbean region, the red algae families Gigartinaceae and Gracilariaceae are recommended to produce feed supplements for ruminants because of their high prevalence in the marine habitats.

In this study, we employ advanced remote sensing and machine learning methodologies to investigate the effects of flooding on biodiversity, from individual species to broader ecological communities. Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and an ensemble of machine-learning algorithms to derive a flood susceptibility indicator. Our primary objective is to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating flood susceptibility, as a proxy for flood risk, into species distribution models (SDMs). By doing so, we aim to improve the performance of SDMs and gain deeper insights into the consequences of floods to biodiversity. Within the biodiverse landscape of the Zagros Mountains, a crucial Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspots, we examined the sensitivity of mammals, amphibians, and reptiles' distributions to flooding. Our analysis compared the performance of models that combined flood susceptibility with climate variables against models relying solely on climate variables. The results indicate that the inclusion of flood susceptibility significantly improves the capacity of models to explain and map species distributions for 67% of the species in our study region. Notably, amphibians and mammals are more profoundly affected by flooding compared to reptiles. The study highlights the importance of incorporating flood susceptibility as a predictor variable in species distribution models to improve the baseline characterization of potential species distributions. The importance of this variable will obviously depend on the regional context and the species studied but its relevance is likely to increase with climate change. In summary, our research demonstrates the integration of remote sensing and machine learning as a potent approach to advance biodiversity data science, monitoring, and conservation in the face of climateinduced flooding.

However, the existing knowledge on the influential role of extreme precipitation on flood events and subsequent economic damage is limited. Thus, this study investigates the causal relationship between flood damage cost, flooded area, and extreme precipitation indices in the Chungcheong region of South Korea using the autoregressive distributed lag-error correction model (ARDL-ECM) framework and pairwise Granger causality analysis. Four extreme precipitation indices: consecutive wet days (CWD), number of very heavy precipitation days (R30mm), maximum 1-day precipitation amount (Rx1day), and simple daily precipitation intensity (SDII) that measure precipitation frequency, intensity, and duration were selected with time series data on the flooded areas and estimated flood damage cost from 1985 to 2020. The ARDL-ECM bound test indicates an existence of a long-run relationship among all the variables. The empirical results of pairwise Granger causality analysis further reveal that flooded area, R30mm, and Rx1day have significant positive causal impacts on the flood damage cost in both short and long-runs, in the current period. This implies that any increase in any of these variables will cause an increase in the flood damage cost. Unidirectional causality exists from the flooded area, R30mm, Rx1days, and SDII to flood damage cost, and from R30mm and SDII to flooded area. These extreme precipitation variables could serve as indicators of flood events and economic flood damage. This study advances the knowledge of the causal link between extreme precipitation indices and economic damage from flood events.

Newly available radar-based forest disturbance information now enables an investigation of the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance in a spatially and temporally explicit manner, especially in the tropics, where frequent cloud cover hinders the use of optical-based remote sensing products. In this study, we applied cross-correlation on monthly precipitation and forest disturbance time series for 2019 and 2020 at a 0.5 degrees grid in the African rainforest. We used the magnitude of the correlation and time lag to assess the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance, and introduced accessibility proxies to analyse the spatial variation of the relationship. Results revealed that a significant negative correlation between forest disturbance and precipitation dominates the study region. We found that significant negative correlations appear on average closer to settlements with overall smaller variations in travel time to settlements compared to grid cells with non-significant and significant positive correlation. The magnitude of the negative correlation increases as the travel time to settlements increases, implying that forest disturbances in less accessible areas are more affected by precipitation seasonality and that in particular human-induced disturbance activities are predominantly carried out in the drier months. Few areas showed a significant positive correlation, mainly resulting from natural causes such as flooding. These new insights in the interaction between forest disturbance, precipitation and accessibility provide a step forward in understanding the complex interactions that underlie the complexity of forest loss patterns that we can increasingly capture with Earth Observation approaches. As such, they can support forest conservation and management in coping with climate change induced changes of precipitation patterns in African rainforest countries.

Farmers are the ones who decide how and when to adapt to excess, scarcity, and even to extreme precipitation events in agriculture. To understand farmer's views on the needs and means to manage future changes in precipitation, a farmer survey was organized in 2018 with 4401 respondents and a follow-up survey in 2020 with 2000 respondents. The aims were: (1) to understand farmers' views on future changes in precipitation patterns, (2) to gain an insight into farmer views on prioritization of the potential key adaptation measures (irrigation, drainage and maintenance of soil conditions) to future floods and drought episodes and thereby, (3) to be better able to support farmers in their primary task of food production in a sustainable manner in a changing climate. This study highlighted that farmers need financial support, but also more information about the costs and benefits of the measures to cope with changing precipitation patterns-not least due to the many uncertainties in projecting future precipitation patterns. As fluctuating precipitation have many environmental impacts in addition to those on production per se, costs and investments of adaptation to climatic constraints should not be payable only by the farmers. Farmers prioritized the soil organic content (SOC) and wellfunctioning subsurface drainage as the main objects of their attention, and these were clearly ahead of future use of irrigation. Taking care of subsurface drainage, soil structure, SOC and functionality is the long-term means to maintain and improve sustainability and productivity, while the implementation of irrigation is a more flexible, one-off measure that requires short-term reactivity as an adaptation option.

However, the literature to date on glacier ES has lacked a systematic analysis of their type and the various stages in the formation of glacier ES, including the linkages between biophysical structures and ecological processes to human values, benefits and well-being. This paper begins to fill this gap by (1) detailing the first Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services classification of ES specific to glaciers; and (2) constructing an ES cascade model specific to the ES of glaciers, integrating four main stages of co-production: value attribution, mobilisation of ES potential, value appropriation, and commercialisation. In both stages, examples from the academic and grey literature are highlighted. Based on a systematic literature review, a total of 15 ES are identified, categorised as follows: provisioning (2), regulation and maintenance (6), and cultural (7). Apart from abiotic regulation and maintenance ES, it is evident that human interventions are necessary in order to mobilise, appropriate and commercialise several glacier ES, including freshwater for drinking, hydropower generation, recreation and education. Rapidly intensifying climate change has led to intense focus on the initial co-production process of value attribution and identification of dynamic ES potential, with a view to maximising commercial benefits in the coming decades where this is possible, especially linked to hydropower generation from glacial rivers. However, this study also finds that adaptive ecosystem management is a necessary pre-requisite of resilience but may be insufficient in this context to address potential ecosystem disservices and potentially catastrophic impacts to human well-being, such as from dangerous glacier outburst floods.

As the occurrence of floods varies with time and space, comprehensive and dynamical assessment of the spatiotemporal variability of flood risk and understanding of its drivers is vital for flood risk management. In this study, we developed a spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA) framework for quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood risk through a case study in a coastal watershed of southeastern China from 1990 to 2015. A comprehensive framework for flood risk assessment was constructed from the hazard, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity components with 23 indicators. The results showed that the highest risk happened in the stage of 2006-2010, while the lowest risk stage was 2011-2015, with higher flood risk in the downstream areas of Jiulong River watershed (JRW). The contribution of each indicator reflects the difference in temporal, spatial and quantity aspects. The top 5 driving factors for JRW included: peak discharge, maximum daily rainfall, age structure, wetland, and reservoir. The risk perception showed a continuous growing impact on flood risk. However, some indicators only showed obvious contributions in the specified area: for example, the built-up expansion in Zhangzhou city; the increase of dike length and the improvement of dike standard in Xinluo district; and the increase of government financial investment in Zhangping and Liancheng district. This study demonstrates the well-performance of our proposed novel approach for flood risk assessment. Our results and conclusions are also of significance for policymakers to understand and point out the deficiencies in the current actions of flood adaption, and consequently develop more targeted and spatially-specific strategies for flood adaptation, in the context of climate change and rapid urbanization.

However, the role of spatial proximity to cities - an important geographical feature - in influencing household vulnerability has not been scrutinized. This paper assesses how distance to cities affects the vulnerability of rural farming communities against flood hazard. This paper proposes a Vulnerability-Proximity Nexus (VPN) framework and operationalises it in the context of Pakistan. A household survey was conducted to collect primary data from three flood-affected sub-districts of Punjab province. A total of 325 samples were collected, out of which 164 samples were from villages located near to the cities and 161 were far from the cities. Vulnerability indices were developed through holistic (exposure, susceptibility, and capacity) and livelihood (human, social, financial, physical, and natural) perspective of vulnerability. Mann-Whitney U and Pearson's correlation tests were performed to analyse linkages between distance and vulnerability. Results confirmed that the distance to the cities influences the vulnerability of surrounding farming communities. A significant and positive correlation between distance to city and rural livelihood vulnerability was found. Rural farming communities living close to the cities were less vulnerable, mainly due to better transfer of services and facilities from cities, which has also made rural communities more educated, informed, financially strong, and connected with easier access to public and private institutions. This study highlights the importance of regional and rural development discourse for vulnerability and can help disaster managers and planners to establish synergies for designing effective disaster risk reduction policies and strategies.

Mapping and monitoring of glacier lake outburst floods using geospatial modelling approach for Darkut valley, Pakistan	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						DTM; GIS and RS; GLOF; HEC-GeoRAS; HEC-RAS; TIN	HIMALAYA; CLIMATE; REGION; WATER; GIS	Climate change and human activities have resulted in the receding of glaciers throughout the world including Pakistan. Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are amongst the most common climate-change-induced hazards in northern Pakistan. In the present study, GLOF mapping and modelling was carried out using remote sensing and geographical information system techniques coupled with ground-truthing. Change detection techniques such as the normalized difference water index were applied on Landsat imagery for the identification of the temporal behaviour of Darkut glacial lake for the last 25 years. The depth of the lake was estimated to be 81 m and the volume of the lake was calculated using a digital terrain model and extracted as 9.79 x 10(6) m(3). The glacial lake extent has increased from 0.045 to 0.154 km(2) in the last two decades. Two GLOF scenarios (peak and extreme flood) were developed on an existing volume of water in the study. There are 14 households exposed to medium flood and 10 to low flood risk while one helipad and one school are also in the low flood zone in the first scenario (i.e. peak flood) based on 87.84 m(3)center dot s(-1) of water. The second scenario (i.e. extreme flood) was executed on 3,128 m(3)center dot s(-1) of water, in which 14 households are at high flood risk, eight at medium and 35 in a low flood zone, as well as one school, a helipad and a community stockpile which are exposed to low flood. The outcomes of the study will help in the development of risk management plans, preparedness strategies and risk reduction from GLOF hazard.

This study assessed recent hydromorphological characteristics of the tropical Tana River in Kenya using flow duration curve, and geospatial techniques to gain a better understanding of human impacts over the last two decades and their consequences for new development projects. The results show that all extremal peak, low, and mean discharges exhibited significant increasing trends over a period of 17 years. Dam construction represents a 13% reduction of the maximum discharge and a 30% decrease in low flows, while post-regulation hydrological changes indicated an increase of 56 and 40% of high flows and low flows respectively. Dominant flow was observed to be higher for the current decade than the previous decade, representing a rise of the dominant streamflow by 33%. The assessment of four morphologically active sites at the downstream reach showed channel adjustments which support the changes in the flow regimes observed. The channel width increased by 8.7 and 1.9% at two sites but decreased by 31.5 and 16.2% for the other two sites under study during the time period. The results underscore the contribution of other main human modifications, apart from regulation, such as increased water abstraction and inter basin transfer, up-stream land use and anthropogenic climate change to assess the ecohydrological status in this river basin. Such streamflow regime dynamics may have implications on water resource management, riverine environments, and development of new water projects.

The changing climate is the primary trigger of the expansion of glacial lakes that increases the possibilities of outburst floods (GLOFs) and leads to quantifiable losses such as mortality and damage to populations and infrastructure downstream. Therefore, determining the hazard related to the glacier lakes of the Himalayan region is essential. We have developed an approach named SHIVEK, consisting of the SWIR band thresholding technique and hazard analysis to estimate the possible downstream risk along the GLOF flow path. We examined the spatiotemporal expansion of Imja Lake from 1997 to 2020 using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 data. We employed an automated form of the previously described method based on SWIR band thresholding. The study creates yearly composites from June to September using pre-processed Landsat imageries using a cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. Our results show a continuous expansion in the geographical area of Imja Lake from 0.81 to 1.56 km(2) in 23 years between 1997 and 2020, averaging nearly 0.032 km(2) per year. Also, the lake's area between 2012 and 2020 expanded by 0.26 km(2). The overall accuracy of 88.96 +/- 6.93% has been achieved for spatiotemporal maps of Imja Lake and intensified confidence in the approach. This study estimates a total of 645 buildings and four bridges that can be impacted due to the outburst of Imja Lake.

Our results demonstrated that the most populated and urbanized towns in the Wielkopolska (Greater Poland, west of Warsaw) region are at the most risk in the event of extreme precipitation occurrence as measured by the total number of interventions made by the SFS. The number of SFS unit interventions in towns, standardized to 10,000 inhabitants, indicates that the highest proportional volume of interventions also occurred in smaller towns. In the rural municipalities the number of SFS unit interventions increases along with higher population density and proportion of infrastructure areas. As analyzed in this study, the 12 years from 2010 to 2021 were characterized by a higher number of days with heavy precipitation, for example, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mm, in comparison to the previous periods 1961-2010 and 1981-2010. Intervention databases collected by emergency services are a valuable source of information for hazard mapping. Based on those and other available data, a statistical model was created and factors influencing the local and regional occurrence of interventions were determined. Increasing suburbanization, the rising proportion of impermeable surfaces, and the impact of climate change are of considerable importance in urban flood risk. It is necessary to help municipalities develop abilities to absorb larger amounts of rainwater.

This study employed innovative trend analysis (ITA), range of variability approach (RVA), and continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) to quantify the past to future hydrological change in the river because of the building of the Farakka Barrage (FB). We also forecast flow regimes using unique hybrid machine learning techniques based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The ITA findings revealed that the average discharge trended substantially negatively throughout the dry season (January-May). However, the RVA analysis showed that average discharge was lower than environmental flows. The CWA indicated that the FB has a significant influence on the periodicity of the streamflow regime. PSO-Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree) was the best fit for average discharge prediction (RMSE = 0.14), PSO-random forest (RF) was the best match for maximum discharge (RMSE = 0.3), and PSO-M5P (RMSE = 0.18) was better for the lowest discharge prediction. Furthermore, the basin's discharge has reduced over time, concerning the riparian environment. This research describes the measurement of hydrological change and forecasts the discharge for upcoming days, which might be valuable in developing sustainable water resource management plans in this location.

The municipality of Los Cabos, Mexico, has been the most affected in the state of Baja California Sur by these hazards due to its location on the southern tip of the peninsula, being exposed with approximately 192 km of coastline; it is an environmental heritage that has made the area a primary tourist attraction in Mexico, which has caused a rapid growth in population with little knowledge about cyclone activity. In addition, there is limited knowledge regarding social indicators that measure vulnerability due to tropical cyclones. Based on the above, the objective of this study was to capture community perceptions about vulnerability related to tropical cyclones and to compare the results with real impacts and their index of socioenvironmental vulnerability, which includes indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, to provide useful information to form strategies to mitigate risk. Data were collected through a questionnaire-survey in 335 randomly selected households; we applied a probability model to the perception analysis and calculated an index to categorize vulnerability. We found differences between perceptions and real affectations, with 64% of households categorized as being highly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, and we detected a lower perception about damage suffered to their households. The variables related to knowledge and local or foreigner status were predictors of vulnerability perception. We included georeferenced data on flooding hazard maps as a strategy for adaptation.

Sixty-six hydrological and environmental flow indicators from the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) were computed to assess future extreme flows in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia, which is particularly vulnerable to flooding. Results show that the annual precipitation, streamflow, maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase by 6.9%, 9.9%, 0.8 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C, respectively, by the 2021-2050 period relative to the 1985-2014 baseline. Monthly precipitation and streamflow are projected to increase especially for the Southwest Monsoon (June-September) and the early phase of the Northeast Monsoon (December) periods. The magnitudes of the 1-, 3-, 7-, 30- and 90-day minima flows are projected to increase by 7.2% to 8.2% and the maxima flows by 10.4% to 28.4%, respectively. Lastly, changes in future hydro-climatic extremes are frequently quite different between the high-resolution and low-resolution models, e.g., the high-resolution models projected an increase of 11.8% in mean monthly flow in November-December-January compared to 3.2% for the low-resolution models.

J	Junqueira, JR; Serrao-Neumann, S; White, I				Junqueira, Juliana Reu; Serrao-Neumann, Silvia; White, Iain			A systematic review of approaches for modelling current and future impacts of extreme rainfall events using green infrastructure	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Flooding; Low-impact development; LID; Stormwater management; Land-use planning; Urban drainage; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORMWATER; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; BIORETENTION; ROOFS; WATER; AREA; CITY	A range of modelling approaches has been developed to assess how green infrastructure could mitigate the effects of extreme rainfall events. This paper seeks to develop this agenda by reviewing how these modelling approaches incorporate, consider, and appraise information of value to land-use planning, policy, and practice to better understand why their implementation is infrequent and to help develop a research agenda. Our findings indicate that the information generated by current GI modelling approaches are not well integrated into the demands of land-use planning, and may more reflect the information availability than useability. We find that modelling outputs do not tend to generate the type of high resolution information covering the appropriate spatial and temporal scales that is needed to best support planning decisions. There are also gaps in the assessment of future climate risks, such as increased rainfall intensity, and how this links to future pressures, such as escalating urban growth and development demands, and the interaction between the two areas. The paper concludes that to increase the implementation of green infrastructure, modelling researchers should work more closely with decision-makers to better link data on the effects of GI to the politics involved in their implementation in planning decisions, particularly how trade-offs occur over different scales and times, and between sectors.

J	Huebner, S				Huebner, Stefan			Tackling Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Ecosystem Destruction: How US-Japanese Ocean Industrialization and the Metabolist Movement's Global Legacy Shaped Environmental Thought (circa 1950s Present)	ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY			English	Article								Over the past decade, experts have discussed the offshore technologies so closely associated with accelerating climate change-namely, offshore oil and gas drilling-as tools for climate action, as was the case at a United Nations roundtable in April 2019. Such experts have frequently used offshore technologies for the construction of flood-resilient floating structures and for zero-carbon energy generation, such as in the case of offshore wind parks, simultaneously tackling the problem of carbon fuel-related air pollution. Such developments draw attention to the intellectual history of ocean industrialization, its driving forces, and related environmental thought. This article examines the intellectual origins of ecomodernism and similar green growth strategies. Using an oceanic perspective and placing the ideas of Japanese star architect and Metabolist movement member Kiyonori Kikutake and US ocean expert John P. Craven at its center, this article argues that their two prototypes of floating industrial combines tested in Hawaii and Okinawa during the early 1970s applied the Japanese Metabolist movement's design principles of mobility, modularity, and plug-in structures to Pacific waters in an effort to decouple ocean industrialization from the destruction of ecosystems. Several of their proto-ecomodernist ideas, born as techno-optimist reactions to neo-Malthusian fears of resource depletion and overpopulation, have become central pillars of ecomodernist thought.

J	Hailemariam, SF; Alfredsen, K				Hailemariam, Seble Fissha; Alfredsen, Knut			Quantitative Flood Risk Assessment in Drammenselva River, Norway	WATER			English	Article						flood; hazard; GIS; hydraulic modeling; flood risk; Drammenselva River	DAMAGE; IMPACT	Floods are frequent natural hazards, triggering significant negative consequences for the economy every year. Their impact is expected to increase in the near future due to socio-economic development and climate change. In order to minimize the probability and magnitude of expected economic losses and compensation costs, it is essential that flood risk managers are properly informed about potential damage related to hazard features and exposure. In this paper, a flood damage estimation method was proposed for the assessment of flood risk in the Drammen River basin by using a hydraulic model, GIS, and a flood loss estimation model. Hazard variables such as flood depth, flood extent, and flood velocity were computed for the current and future climatic scenarios using the hydraulic model for flood damage assessment. To visualize the flood extent, velocity, depth, and their impact, the results of modelling are illustrated in the form of flood inundation maps produced in GIS. A flood loss estimate included buildings and other infrastructure that are major exposures in flood-prone areas. The flood damage model is formulated based on stage-damage relationships between different flood depths and land-use categories. It calculates the economic loss related to different land-use features based on the simulated flood parameter obtained from the hydraulic model from 100- to 1000-year return periods. For the case study, the results show that the highest proportion of the total damage in each repetition interval (approximately 90-92%) is expected to occur in buildings. In addition, results showed that the effects of climate change will raise the total damage from floods by 20.26%.

The empirical focus is Accra, Ghana, a rapidly growing African city with discernible challenges in its transport system and a longstanding history of recurrent flood hazards, which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change in the future. In a context where there is very little mobility data available from official sources, the paper utilizes data from a large mobility survey (n = 1053) conducted through in-person interviews in July-August 2021 in 10 selected neighborhoods in Accra's sprawling periphery. The survey targeted economically active adults, who are travelling regularly in relation to their income-generating activities. The survey recorded respondents' experiences with a wide range of mobility disruptions caused by heavy precipitation and water on the roads. The analysis of survey data is supplemented with insights from qualitative interviews with a range of local key informants (n = 75). The research illuminates the diversity of mobility disruptions experienced by Accra's residents during and after heavy precipitation events and the adverse implications for livelihoods and access to markets and services. The results highlight that mobility disruptions related to heavy precipitation are an extremely commonplace experience for residents in Accra's periphery, across a diverse collection of neighborhoods and across travel patterns and traveler characteristics. While existing research tends to privilege the most dramatic and disastrous flood events and the associated destruction of property, this research, however, draws attention to the somewhat under-researched topic of mobility disruptions to everyday activities and their implications for livelihoods and access to markets and services.

J	Li, YH; Wright, DB; Liu, Y				Li, Yihan; Wright, Daniel B.; Liu, Yuan			Flood-Induced Geomorphic Change of Floodplain Extent and Depth: A Case Study of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							PEARSON TYPE-3 DISTRIBUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RIVER MORPHOLOGY; LAND-USE; URBANIZATION; HAZARD; IMPACTS; RISK; MANAGEMENT	Rainfall from tropical cyclones (TCs) in Puerto Rico and similar environments can cause extreme riverine flooding accompanied by substantial scour, transport, and sediment deposition. These processes can alter channel and floodplain properties that, in turn, influence the susceptibility to future flooding. The potential of these geomorphic impacts of major floods to influence floodplains (e.g., 100-year flood extent and depth) has received relatively little research attention. Using high-resolution LiDAR topography collected shortly before and shortly after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, this study examines how 10- and 100-year flood extent and flood depth changed in thirteen river reaches in response to Hurricane Maria, a devastating TC that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. These findings were contextualized by comparing them against floodplain extent and depth changes resulting from peak flow quantile estimates created with and without Hurricane Maria streamflow observations. Changes in the flood extent (depth) associated with geomorphic responses to Hurricane Maria were up to 7% (16%) for 10-year floods. Somewhat smaller changes of up to 4% (8%) were found for 100-year flood extents (depths). On average, these changes were smaller than the peak flow quantile effects for the 100-year flood but greater for 10-year events. These results suggest that, at least in tropical areas affected by TCs, geomorphic changes wrought by major storms should be added to the list of considerations in floodplain mapping and updating. This issue may become more important as climate change continues to intensify TC-induced rainfall and flooding. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Rahimi, M; Ghorbani, M; Azadi, H				Rahimi, Majid; Ghorbani, Mehdi; Azadi, Hossein			Structural characteristics of governmental and non-governmental institutions network: case of water governance system in Kor River basin in Iran	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Water governance system; Water governance regime; Social network analysis; Power distribution; Coordination and collaboration	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT	Water has been the source of life since it was found. In recent years, the false assurance of the permanence of water services in Iran has led to the creation of institutional structures related to water in an inappropriate and incompatible manner with environmental changes, and when water crises occur, such as droughts, floods, and, on a larger scale, climate changes, they do not have the flexibility and resilience to these changes. To this end, recognizing the current water governance system in the country is considered an essential need. The present study examines the regime of water governance and its structural characteristics in the Kor River basin, which is one of the areas facing water shortage challenges. In order to analyze these characteristics and determine the regime of the water governance system, the method of social network analysis (SNA) was used in the network of formal and informal institutions of Kherameh county downstream of the Kor River basin. This research has been done in a period of 9 months and includes designing questionnaires, field visits, completing questionnaires and analyzing the results. The results showed that the water governance network in this region has an unstable and weak structure and as a result, the level of cooperation and coordination between the institutions is low and the level of power centralization is high. As a result, the governing regime is centralized, and therefore, the establishment of a polycentric governance system requires the improvement of horizontal relations between formal and informal institutions and protection and development institutions.

In view of the inherent uncertainty associated with these models, this study uses a combined top-down and bottom-up approach called Collaborative Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA). Using the case of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, Bangkok, this study demonstrates the application of the approach, which includes (a) identifying critical thresholds that impact the system's performance, (b) unearthing the system vulnerabilities through a stress test (scenario analysis), and (c) identifying feasible adaptation interventions. Through a stakeholder consultation process, it was found that streamflow, salinity, and turbidity are the key performance metrics of the water supply system. A series of stress tests to the system was conducted by adjusting input variables assuming a wide range of possible future climatic conditions. Frequency curves of the various input variables were developed to facilitate stakeholders' planning for impending risks and for improving the overall robustness of the water supply system. Based on the stress test results and past studies of the study area, the raw water source of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority is expected to be more saline in the future with more frequent and severe low flow conditions, for which a number of adaptation actions were formulated and proposed. It is suggested to develop adaptation pathways that can address a range of expected impacts of future climatic conditions on the Bangkok water supply system. The methodology presented is useful for study areas where a model of the system is unavailable, and data limitation is a challenge.

Streamflow depletion can impact aquatic ecosystems through changes in the availability and temperature of surface water. Regions with a combination of groundwater withdrawals and groundwater-dependent resources therefore require management strategies that respond to the needs of both humans and aquatic ecosystems. Here, we review and evaluate opportunities and challenges for applying an environmental flows approach to streamflow depletion management based on functional flows and the Ecological Limits of Hydrological Alteration (ELOHA) frameworks. We highlight the need for explicit recognition of temperature in streamflow depletion science, especially given the realities of climate change. Using a demonstrative analysis on Wisconsin streams, we show that both the magnitude and variability of streamflow and stream temperatures are likely to be impacted by groundwater withdrawal, with particular impacts on low flows during the baseflow period. Then, we evaluate potential challenges to integrating existing groundwater withdrawal management and environmental flows approaches and provide a pathway to address inherent tensions between these two frameworks. In particular, we find that uncertainty associated with the first two ELOHA steps (setting a baseline and classifying streams) can lead to substantially different estimates of ecological impacts in streamflow depletion contexts. Navigating these tensions requires stakeholder engagement throughout the process of setting acceptable management thresholds to move towards practical, management focused integration of environmental flows and streamflow depletion science.

Recent works on riverine N2O emissions focus mainly on contributions from in-channel, benthic, and fluvial hyporheic environments under assumptions of steady-state conditions and homogeneous sediment hydraulic conductivity (K). However, riparian floodplains are also a potentially important N2O source characterized by complex sediment heterogeneity and dynamic surface and groundwater interactions. We use numerical flow and reactive transport models to investigate the influence of complex sedimentary architecture and high-flow events (e.g., storms) on N2O production. We interpret the correlation between flow and solute fields with the flow topological Okubo-Weiss metric (OW) and the scalar dissipation rate weighted by soil organic matter (OM) fraction and soil saturation. We model a heterogeneous riparian floodplain based on field observations from the Theis Environmental Monitoring and Modeling Site, Ohio, USA. N2O production is greatest within intermediate-K sediments (e.g., sands) where denitrification rates are highest, and emissions increase by more than an order of magnitude during storms. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the denitrification rate is most influential for N2O flux, accounting for nearly 46% of the variance in production rates. Denitrification rates adapt to spatial changes in the flow topology (measured by OW) related to sediment heterogeneity and are strongly influenced by subsurface mixing dynamics. Mixing is greatest in shear strain-dominated regions, while vorticity promotes OM dissolution and prolongs residence times. Accurate lithologic representation is imperative for characterizing subsurface N2O production dynamics, especially given growing concern regarding climate change driven hydrologic changes within watersheds worldwide.

J	Gül, GO; Gül, A; Najar, M				Gul, Gulay Onusluel; Gul, Ali; Najar, Mohamed			Historical evidence of climate change impact on drought outlook in river basins: analysis of annual maximum drought severities through daily SPI definitions	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Drought; Drought index; Drought severity; Daily SPI; Climate change		In the context of major outcomes of a steadily changing climate, extreme climatic conditions and the associated events in various forms of weather-related natural disasters, e.g. droughts, floods, and heat waves, are more frequently experienced on the global scale in recent years. In support of this argument, there are adequate numbers of explicit signals over such a persistent outlook, which is greatly illustrated by historical data and observations. This study, which is mainly oriented to investigating the drought behaviour in Thracian, Aegean and Mediterranean transects of Turkey's major river basins, is actually inspired by the foreseen potential of using annual maximum drought severity series (based on drought definition through the standardized precipitation index (SPI)) within a framework that resembles the use of flood discharge directly from flow measurements in a river basin. To this end, a series of spatial analyses were employed to identify different aspects of flood appearance in the study extent, including trend views on annual average drought severity series, shifts in the starting time of the annually most severe flood periods, and changes in spatial coverage views of average drought conditions under different drought severity categories. The framework of the analytical approaches depends greatly on validated international datasets and open-source computational algorithms. The results from the analyses that were conducted in two consecutive periods of 1958-1980 and 1981-2004 revealed that Turkey's western and southern river basin systems seemed to have experienced quite different behaviours between the two periods in terms of drought severity magnitudes, drought durations and annual occurrence times.

Accounting for Multisectoral Dynamics in Supporting Equitable Adaptation Planning: A Case Study on the Rice Agriculture in the Vietnam Mekong Delta	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						adaptation; agriculture; equity; multisectoral dynamics; Vietnam Mekong Delta	INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; LONG-TERM CLIMATE; LAND-USE; DEEP UNCERTAINTY; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; GIANG PROVINCE; FUTURE; VULNERABILITY; VALIDATION	The need for explicitly considering equity in climate change adaptation planning is increasingly being recognized. However, evaluations of adaptation often adopt an aggregated perspective, while disaggregation of results is important to learn about who benefits when and where. A typical example is adaptation of rice agriculture in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD). Efforts focused on flood protection have mainly benefitted large-scale farmers while harming small-scale farmers. To investigate the distributional consequences of adaptation policies in the VMD, we assess both aggregate total output and equity indicators, as well as disaggregated impacts in terms of district-level farming profitability. Doing so requires an adequate representation of the multisectoral dynamics between the human and biophysical systems which influence farming profitability. We develop a spatially explicit integrated assessment model that couples inundation, sedimentation, soil fertility and nutrient dynamics, and behavioral land-use change and farming profitability calculation. We find that inter-district inequality responds in a non-linear way to climatic and socio-economic changes and choices of adaptation policies. The patterns of who wins and who loses could change substantially when a different policy is implemented or if a slightly different uncertain future materializes. We also find that there is no simple ranking of alternative adaptation policies, so one should make trade-offs based on agreed preferences. Accounting for equity implies exploring the distribution of outcomes over different groups over a range of uncertain futures. Only by accounting for multisectoral dynamics can planners anticipate the equity consequences of adaptation and prepare additional measures to aid the worse-off actors.

Investigations of geomorphological processes in the steep torrent channels followed in the 1980s, along with detailed observations of biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes in individual forest stands. More recently, research in the Alptal has addressed the impacts of climate change on water supply and runoff generation. In this article, we describe, for the first time, the evolution of catchment research at Alptal, and present new analyses of long-term trends and short-term hydrologic behaviour. Hydrometeorological time series from the past 50 years show substantial interannual variability, but only minimal long-term trends, except for the similar to 2 degrees C increase in mean annual air temperature over the 50-year period, and a corresponding shift towards earlier snowmelt. Similar to previous studies in larger Alpine catchments, the decadal variations in mean annual runoff in Alptal's small research catchments reflect the long-term variability in annual precipitation. In the Alptal valley, the most evident hydrological trends were observed in late spring and are related to the substantial change in the duration of the snow cover. Streamflow and water quality are highly variable within and between hydrological events, suggesting rapid shifts in flow pathways and mixing, as well as changing connectivity of runoff-generating areas. This overview illustrates how catchment research in the Alptal has evolved in response to changing societal concerns and emerging scientific questions.

Crops grow best within specific temperature intervals, and excessive heat is detrimental to the physiological processes of crops and eventually affects yield levels. Analysing historical changes in concurrent extreme high temperatures is critical to preparing for and mitigating the negative effects of climatic change. The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important wheat production area in China. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations in temperature and heat wave trends in the NCP were analysed. Furthermore, we examined the potential of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to capture the influence of heat wave impacts on wheat crops in the NCP by comparing satellite remote sensing data of SIF and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and validated ground-based yield data. The results indicate that temperatures and the number of heat wave days in the study region all show increasing trends, especially daily minimum temperature, which has increased by 0.38 degrees C per decade for the past 30 years. Spatially, the southern NCP has suffered greater increasing-temperature trends and more heat wave days than the northern region. Regarding the response of SIF and NDVI to heat waves, SIF can better capture wheat yield decline due to heat waves compared to NDVI; thus, the SIF result indicated more sensitivity to heat waves compared to NDVI.

An intensification of the hydrological cycle and changing land use will result in floodplains becoming inundated for longer durations in the future. We collected intact soil cores from a floodplain meadow downstream of an urban catchment and subjected them to an inundation/drainage cycle in the laboratory to investigate the effect of flood duration on trace element concentrations in the soil porewater. The porewater concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Zn increased, whereas Cu and Pb decreased with flood duration. All the Cr present in porewaters was identified as Cr(III). Copper concentrations increased after drainage but Pb mobility remained suppressed. Both pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased with flood duration but were lower in treatments that were drained for the longest duration (which were also the treatments flooded for the shortest duration). The porewater concentrations of Cr and Ni decreased after drainage to levels below those observed before inundation, mirroring the DOC concentrations. We concluded that the duration of floodplain inundation does have an influence on the environmental fate of trace elements but that flooding does not influence all trace elements in the same way. The implications of an intensification of the hydrological cycle over the coming decades are that floodplains may become a source of some trace elements to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.Environ Toxicol Chem2020;00:1-12.

Polish forests are characterized by high biodiversity. Unfortunately, in recent years, the forests of Central Europe have been affected by climate change problems, in particular meteorological drought. In Poland, even those stands which consist of species that were widely recognized as drought tolerant and easily adaptable to environmental changes are beginning to die. The article presents engineering methods applicable to forest environment protection, largely developed at the University of Life Sciences in Poznan and implemented by the State Forests-National Forest Holding in Poland, to minimize the effects of drought. Among the issues raised are ways to protect forests against fires, modern technologies for fire road surface construction and small-scale water retention in forests. A comprehensive solution to problems related to progressive drought is a must. Scientists and foresters are observing the dying of large areas of stands and, at the same time, intensification of wildlife migration due to the search for new habitats as a consequence of the drought. Therefore, the issue of building animal crossings during the current dynamic expansion of the road network in Poland has also been presented in the paper. Another subject pointed to in the text is forest tourism. Forests provide opportunities for recreation and rest to society. However, the increasing tourist pressure in some regions may cause adverse environmental effects. Finally, the paper shows some examples of supporting forest environment protection using remote sensing techniques. Generally, the aim of the paper is to present experiences and comprehensive solutions implemented in Poland.

Here, we report a high-resolution soil erosion sequence during the past 2000 years based on grain-size data from a sediment core GS07A in Tianchi Lake in the Chinese Loess Plateau. These grain-size data are analysed by end-member modelling and further deciphered by detailed modern investigations of surface sediments, surface soils, and modern dust samples aided by published grain-size distribution characteristics of different depositional provenances and processes. Six strong soil erosion periods, including more than 20 serious soil erosion events, are inferred at 150-300 CE, 450-750 CE, 900-1100 CE, 1200-1400 CE, 1650-1800 CE, and 1950-2000 CE. These soil erosion records correspond well with intensive flood events in downstream rivers and the neighbouring Longxi area documented from the historical literature, suggesting that regional high-intensity rainfall or flood events are the main cause of soil erosion. Vegetation cover in the catchment also influenced soil erosion: light vegetation cover aggravated soil erosion even in the periods with a low frequency of flooding, while heavy cover reduced soil erosion even in the periods with a high frequency of flooding. Our results highlight the role of sustainable land use and vegetation restoration around the catchment in controlling soil erosion in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

The efficacy of adaptive policies hinges on detecting on-going change and ensuring that actions are indeed taken if and when necessary. This is operationalised by including a monitoring system composed of signposts and triggers in the design of the plan. A well-designed monitoring system is indispensable for the effective implementation of adaptive policies. Despite the importance of monitoring for adaptive policies, the present literature has not considered criteria enabling the a-priori evaluation of the efficacy of signposts. In this paper, we introduce criteria for the evaluation of individual signposts and the monitoring system as a whole. These criteria are relevance, observability, completeness, and parsimony. These criteria are intended to enhance the capacity to detect the need for adaptation in the presence of noisy and ambiguous observations of the real system. The criteria are identified from an analysis of the information chain, from system observations to policy success, focusing on how data becomes information. We illustrate how models, in particular, the combined use of stochastic and exploratory modelling can be used to assess individual signposts, and the whole monitoring system according to these criteria. This analysis provides significant insight into critical factors that may hinder learning from data. The proposed criteria are demonstrated using a hypothetical case, in which a monitoring system for a flood protection policy in the Niger River is designed and tested.

Therefore, Extension and advisory services (EAS) need to navigate the knowledge landscape effectively to connect various farm actors and help secure the optimum benefits of knowledge and information for making rational decisions. However, little is known how EAS can perform this task to combat various effects of climate change. This study investigates the means of brokering knowledge by the EAS to help the farming sector adapt to flash flooding. The research was conducted in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh with 73 staff of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), the largest public EAS in Bangladesh. The results showed that DAE primarily dealt with crop production-related information. However, EAS did not navigate knowledge and information about flash flooding, such as weather fore-casting and crop-saving-embankments updates, among the farming actors. Moreover, they missed the broad utilization of internet-based-communication channels to rapidly navigate information and knowledge about possible flash flooding and its adaptation strategies. This article provides some policy implications to effectively support the adaptation of farming system to flash flooding through EAS.

Policy experimentation within flood risk management: Transition pathways in Austria	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Austria; bottom-up innovation; longitudinal qualitative research; policy entrepreneur; resilience; transition	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION; RIVER RESTORATION; FRAMEWORK; ADAPTATION; BARRIERS; INITIATIVES; EXPERIENCES; TYPOLOGY; POLITICS	Flood risk management (FRM) is facing various challenges, such as climate change and biodiversity losses. Traditional structural FRM measures are now not always feasible as responses to these challenges. One answer might be the use of policy experiments to promote innovation. This paper aims to assess and to explain why innovations in FRM are rarely implemented. We analysed seven innovative strategies across Austria that combine several different approaches. Each is concerned with risk reduction systems designed to save space, time and possible rising costs. The research used 76 qualitative standardised semi-structured interviews with key FRM experts conducted between 2012 and 2021 in order to examine transition pathways through time. The results show that there exist numerous drivers and barriers to debating, designing and implementing FRM innovations. The capture of transition pathways nevertheless shows the system shift from a more traditional understanding towards a transformative path, which created new understandings of the role of the different actors in FRM as well as new institutional settings. However, these policy experiments were still led by the relevant public administrations as they are the main funders, the principal actors in the planning and implementation phases in the realisation of many of these innovations.

This article aims at establishing a rainfall-runoff (RR) relationship; estimating depth and extent of inundation under climate change scenarios; assessing impacts on the socio-economy; and identifying and evaluating adaptation strategies in the ERW. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to generate peak flows which were then entered into a hydraulic model to simulate inundation. Results were validated with field survey. The calibrated and validated RR and hydraulic models were fed with projected future climate (2021-2050) derived from multiple regional-climate-models to assess the changes in inundation. Results showed the peak discharge likely exceeds 10,500 m(3)/s at the ERW outlet in the extreme future flood scenario with corresponding inundation of 80 km(2) and up to a depth of 11 m sweeping away over 1000 houses and 19 km(2) of agricultural land in the critical areas. Constructing a 17 km long embankment in the critical areas along the right bank of the East Rapti River could reduce the flood spread by 35%, safeguarding 78% of the houses and saving 51% agricultural land compared with the scenarios without the embankment.

The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch) and cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were quantified in samples of stems, branches and leaves of individuals distributed in contrasting zones regarding the occurrence of floods [periodically floodable (PI), transitional (IT) and non-floodable (NI)]. Individuals from the non-flooded zone had higher concentrations of starch and hemicelluloses in the branches and leaves. On the other hand, cellulose and lignin concentrations were higher in the leaves of individuals from the periodically flooded and transitional zones. The variations in the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates and cell wall polymers were mainly associated with water availability and plasticity of the species, in addition to possible influences of soil nutrient supply and the occurrence of herbivory. The sensitivity in the dynamics of the carbon molecules of P. icicariba in a diverse and spatially short environmental gradient, requires considerable plasticity of the species that, in the imminence of climatic changes, must favor its survival in the face of the imposition of new environmental filters.

The purpose of the present study is to compare the results of maximum instantaneous flood analysis under stationary and non-stationary conditions in Ghareh Sou basin, and also answer the question as to whether there is a difference between estimating the return period of maximum instantaneous flood in stationary and non-stationary conditions. First, the values of the temperature, wind speed, and rainfall of the study area under the two scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 of the Hadley Centre coupled Model, version3 (HadCM3) model were downscaled. In the following, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was utilized to generate daily runoff. For converting the daily discharge to the maximum instantaneous flood, four methods of Fuller, Sangal, Fill Steiner, and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared. Finally, the maximum instantaneous floods of the future period were introduced to the Non-stationary Extreme Value Analysis (NEVA) software. Based on the results obtained from the research, the lack of considering the non-stationary conditions in the flood frequency analysis can result in underestimating the maximum instantaneous flood, which can also provide more risks for the related hydraulic structures.

URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Climate information services; Japan; Risk communication; Risk governance; Social dimensions of climate change; Urban climate change	URBAN; POLICY; PARTICIPATION; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; STORAGE	This paper evaluates the role of socio-cultural issues in developing climate information services that are accessible and engaging to urban communities. Two public-facing city-level climate information provision initiatives in Japan are evaluated in light of theory in environmental risk communication. The first case is Fukuoka City, Kyushu, in particular increased flood and heat risk. The second case is Tomakomai City, Hokkaido, particularly municipal data provision on potential localised climate risks related to marine environmental change. Evaluation is undertaken through in-depth interviews with local-level actors (policymakers, scientists, NGOs, citizens), and field observation in each location. The paper argues that at a stage where principles and best practices on climate information service provision are still emerging, it is crucial to avoid assumptions about what communities will want to know about climate risks. The paper hence proposes principles for more appropriate climate risk communication. These include (a) identifying which institutions citizens look to for information on local weather and climate; (b) acknowledging that publics can, in appropriate contexts, be able and willing to engage with complex information on urban climate risk; and (c) considering how data-driven information services fit with the more informal ways in which people can experience environmental change.

Bayesian statistical models were used to identify important physical and ecological factors explaining Arctic char presence and persistence in Irish lakes. Maximum lake depth and the presence of mixed fish communities (i.e. including non-salmonid fish species) were the most important drivers of Arctic char presence. There was a 75% probability that an Irish lake would contain Arctic char when maximum depth exceeded 40 m, if only a salmonid community was present. However, the required depth increased to 57 m when a mixed fish community (e.g. pike, perch or roach) was present. Similar variables explained char persistence, with surviving Arctic char populations being more likely in lakes with greater maximum depth and fewer non-salmonid fish species. Tested temperature covariates were not important in explaining Arctic char presence or persistence in Irish lakes. A risk analysis was undertaken to identify which Arctic char lakes are vulnerable to colonisation by thermally plastic mixed fish communities due to flooding. Results indicated that 32 out of 45 lakes were not at any risk from the colonisation of thermally plastic mixed fish communities and 13 lakes had some level of risk.

Arctic Greening Caused by Warming Contributes to Compositional Changes of Mycobiota at the Polar Urals	FORESTS			English	Article						treeline; climate change; fungal ecology; diversity; monitoring; NDVI; permafrost; remote sensing data	TREELINE ADVANCES; CLIMATE; FUNGI; DIVERSITY; BASIDIOMYCOTA; FORESTS; ECOTONE; SHIFTS	The long-term influence of climate change on spatio-temporal dynamics of the Polar mycobiota was analyzed on the eastern macro slope of the Polar Urals (Sob River valley and Mountain Slantsevaya) over a period of 60 years. The anthropogenic impact is minimal in the study area. Effects of environmental warming were addressed as changes in treeline and forest communities (greening of the vegetation). With warming, permafrost is beginning to thaw, and as it thaws, it decomposes. Therefore, we also included depth of soil thawing and litter decomposition in our study. Particular attention was paid to the reaction of aphyllophoroid fungal communities concerning these factors. Our results provide evidence for drastic changes in the mycobiota due to global warming. Fungal community composition followed changes of the vegetation, which was transforming from forest-tundra to northern boreal type forests during the last 60 years. Key fungal groups of the ongoing borealization and important indicator species are discussed. Increased economic activity in the area may lead to deforestation, destruction of swamps, and meadows. However, this special environment provides important services such as carbon sequestration, soil formation, protecting against flood risks, and filtering of air. In this regard, we propose to include the studied territory in the Polarnouralsky Natural Park.

To fully understand ecohydrological processes and accurately describe the coupling between ecological and hydrological processes, a distributed ecohydrological model was constructed by integrating multisource information into distributed dynamic process model (DDPM). We mainly describe runoff generation and convergence modules. Based on the improved HBV model and degree-3 h factor method, runoff generation and snow routines were constructed for semiarid grassland basins. In view of meandering and variable steppe river channels and steep hydrological relief characteristics, a confluence module was constructed; the 1-km bend radius equivalent concept was innovatively proposed to unify river channel bend degrees. The daily runoff simulation validation results obtained using two datasets were R2 = 0.947 and 0.932, NSE = 0.945 and 0.905, KGE = 0.971 and 0.680. In the 3-hour flood simulations, the DDPM could better restore small long-distance water flows than the confluence method that did not consider actual river lengths or bend energy losses; the DDPM more accurately simulated the flood peak arrival time than the confluence method that did not consider overflow. The simulated mainstream overflow frequency increased by 0.84/10 years, and significant interaction periods of 10 to 13 years occurred with local precipitation, ecological status, and global climate change. An approximately 2-year lag occurred in the global climate change response. This study helps us further understand and reveal the ecohydrological processes of steppe rivers in semiarid regions.

While various tools and measures are under examination for building and enhancing resilience capacity in order to improve the preparedness of these communities for future events, social capital has been shown to influence how local communities can be resilient using their social connectedness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the function of social capital in informing and improving the resilience capacity process of coastal communities in northern Iran. This study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods and analyzed a number of social capital indicators in the study area in a field survey using questionnaires and techniques of inferential statistics (i.e., Pearson correlation and T-test). For this reason, 376 residents from the towns that sustained the largest human and financial losses were chosen for examination. The results showed that bonding capital has a considerable effect on the community's resilience capacity. Moreover, some social capital criteria, including respect for the rights of the neighbors, existence of public green space, children's playground, and planting trees, are the most important criteria in developing capacities for enhancing resilience among the residents of the community under study. This shows that developing community resilience through social ability and trust will be more successful than doing so by just raising awareness of hazard threats. This study recommends that further efforts be made to increase the capability of both formal and informal communal institutions. The structural adjustments that are necessary, on the other hand, are difficult.

Evolution of Spatial Risk of Malaria Infection After a Pragmatic Chemoprevention Program in Response to Severe Flooding in Rural Western Uganda	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						climate change; flooding; malaria; Plasmodium	RAPID DIAGNOSTIC-TEST; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; TRANSMISSION; IMPACT; MAP	Background Malaria epidemics result from extreme precipitation and flooding, which are increasing with global climate change. Local adaptation and mitigation strategies will be essential to prevent excess morbidity and mortality.Methods We investigated the spatial risk of malaria infection at multiple timepoints after severe flooding in rural western Uganda employing longitudinal household surveys measuring parasite prevalence and leveraging remotely sensed information to inform spatial models of malaria risk in the 3 months after flooding.Results We identified clusters of malaria risk emerging in areas (1) that showed the greatest changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from pre- to postflood and (2) where residents were displaced for longer periods of time and had lower access to long-lasting insecticidal nets, both of which were associated with a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test result. The disproportionate risk persisted despite a concurrent chemoprevention program that achieved high coverage.Conclusions The findings enhance our understanding not only of the spatial evolution of malaria risk after flooding, but also in the context of an effective intervention. The results provide a "proof of concept" for programs aiming to prevent malaria outbreaks after flooding using a combination of interventions. Further study of mitigation strategies-and particularly studies of implementation-is urgently needed. Geographic information system tools enabled the monitoring of malaria clusters during an ongoing chemoprevention program conducted after severe flooding in rural Uganda. Similar approaches may help improve the effectiveness of programs intended to mitigate the health impacts of climate-driven disasters.

A unique, state-of-the-art coupled modelling system was developed using hydrological and hydrodynamic models. The results of four regional downscaled models from the Rossby Centre high-resolution regional atmospheric climate model have been bias-corrected using in situ measurements and were used as forcing to assess the changes that the continuum will undergo until the end of this century. Results show that the Curonian Lagoon will be subjected to higher riverdischarges that in turn increase the outgoing fluxes into the Baltic Sea.Through these higher fluxes, both the water residence time and saltwaterintrusion into the lagoon event frequency will decrease. Most of thesechanges will be more pronounced in the northern part of the lagoon, which is more likely to be influenced by the variations in the Nemunas riverdischarge. Its delta area may be susceptible to flooding as a result of theelevated discharge during winter. The southern part of the lagoon willexperience lesser changes. While water temperatures in the entire lagoon and the southeastern Baltic Sea will steadily increase and salinity willdecrease, the foreseen changes in the physical characteristics will not cause significant shifts in the ecosystem functioning but may affect the nutrient retention capacity. However, some ecosystem services such as ice fishing are expected to vanish completely due to the loss of ice cover.

A deep learning synthetic likelihood approximation of a non-stationary spatial model for extreme streamflow forecasting	SPATIAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Climate change; Deep learning; Density regression; Gaussian process; Max -stable processes; Vecchia approximation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CHANGING CLIMATE; RIVER; STATIONARITY; FRAMEWORK; MAXIMA; DEAD	Extreme streamflow is a key indicator of flood risk, and quantify-ing the changes in its distribution under non-stationary climate conditions is key to mitigating the impact of flooding events. We propose a non-stationary process mixture model (NPMM) for annual streamflow maxima over the central US (CUS) which uses downscaled climate model precipitation projections to fore-cast extremal streamflow. Spatial dependence for the model is specified as a convex combination of transformed Gaussian and max-stable processes, indexed by a weight parameter which identifies the asymptotic regime of the process. The weight parameter is modeled as a function of the annual precipita-tion for each of the two hydrologic regions within the CUS, introducing spatio-temporal non-stationarity within the model. The NPMM is flexible with desirable tail dependence properties, but yields an intractable likelihood. To address this, we embed a neural network within a density regression model which is used to learn a synthetic likelihood function using simulations from the NPMM with different parameter settings. Our model is fitted using observational data for 1972-2021, and inference carried out in a Bayesian framework. The two regions within the CUS are estimated to be in different asymptotic regimes based on the posterior distribution of the weight parameter. Annual streamflow maxima estimates based on global climate models for two representative climate pathway scenarios suggest an overall increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme streamflow for 2006-2035 compared to the historical period of 1972-2005.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The Jeziorsko dam reservoir was built in 1986. It is the second largest dam reservoir in Poland in terms of surface area. In 1994, a hydropower plant with an installed capacity of 4.89 MW started operation. The study results show the average annual energy production from 1995 to 2021 at a level of 18,718 MWh. On the other hand, energy production largely changed from year to year, from 12,432 MWh (in 2019) to 26,916 MWh (in 2001). The droughts that have occurred in the Warta River basin over the past two decades have had a major impact on energy production. As a consequence of the drought, it was not possible to maintain the required water level in the reservoir. Moreover, a change in the rules for the reservoir's management that led to lower water levels in the reservoir by 1.5 m between April and June was important from the point of view of energy production. Improving the efficiency of energy production requires changing the rules of water management in the reservoir. More flexible reservoir operation schemes should be considered, including operational management based on meteorological and hydrological forecasts. Moreover, other criteria should also be considered, such as maintaining environmental flows, ensuring protection from flooding, and operating a nature reserve around the reservoir.

Furthermore, it significantly limits the infiltration of stormwater into the ground; this, in turn, reduces groundwater supply, ultimately intensifying drought effects. In order to adapt urbanized areas to climate change, the objective is to stop these unfavorable processes and strive for recreating the natural water cycle through developing decentralized stormwater management practices on private properties. An important management instrument that motivates property owners to invest is economic incentives, such as stormwater or impact fees associated with a system of rebates/discounts that depend on the applied stormwater runoff reduction solutions. Herein, we analyze a new economic instrument-a fee for reducing natural field retention-which is planned to be introduced in Poland. We assessed the incentive and funding (income-generating) function of the fee based on the example of the Sudol river catchment in Krakow, Poland. The research involved conducting simulation calculations and assessing the incentive impact through calculating investment Net Present Value (NPV), which is the investor's response to the proposed economic incentives included in the structure of the fee and the rebate system. This study demonstrated errors and loopholes in the suggested fee rules-too low rates that prevent achieving profitability (negative NPV) for small-scale stormwater retention practices, and incorrect conditions that enable obtaining discounted fees. We also estimated the fee rate that ensures investment profitability.

However, drought is also the most complex natural hazard, and its impacts are not evenly distributed across the landscape or among human populations. Just as the impacts of drought vary, so do the coping strategies used by people during drought. The research to-date on drought coping strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly quantitative, focused on top-down interventions, and do not emphasize individual perceptions, experience, and autonomous decision-making when coping with drought. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the human experience of coping with drought through narratives from farmers in Burat and Kinna, Isiolo County, Kenya. This paper highlights (1) their perceived impacts of drought, and (2) the various coping strategies used. A total of 83 interviews were conducted in 20 households. Results found that the perceived impacts of drought were decreased agricultural productivity, livestock hunger, death, and relocation, a lack of water in rivers, human hunger and disease, and violent conflict. The strategies for coping with drought included changing agricultural practices, adopting irrigation, relying on aid, charcoal burning, casual labor, livelihood diversification, and others. Importantly, these coping strategies can be classified into four categories: livelihood diversification, longer-term livelihood strategies, short-term coping activities, and erosive coping strategies. This research contributes to the effort to better document and understand farmers? perceptions and strategies to cope with drought through qualitative research methods and from the perspective of the individual smallholder farmer, which is important for making context-specific policy and project recommendations aimed at smallholder farmers.

We have for the first time provided empirical data by using a combination of field and lab-based studies with a robust sample size (360 adults, 1000 tadpoles) for Hazara Torrent Frog (Allopaa hazarensis) and Murree Hills Frog (Nanorana vicina). In this study, we examined how tadpoles responded to different temperatures through metamorphosis, body size, developmental complications or deformities, fitness and survival. We found that the tadpoles of A. hazarensis and N. vicina showed the same response to elevated temperatures under laboratory conditions including faster metamorphosis, reduction in the body size, more frequent developmental complications or deformities such as edema and tail kinks, lower fitness and higher mortality at elevated temperatures (>26 degrees C). The comparison of thermal sensitivity between the two species showed that N. vicina was more sensitive to higher temperatures. Pakistan has been experiencing changes in climatic patterns, and the ecosystems in northern Pakistan are losing biodiversity due to increasing temperature, frequency of drought and intensity of floods. It is feared that these frogs may experience local extinction in future. Our findings contribute to filling the information gap regarding impacts of temperature increase on biodiversity of high altitude forested montane ecosystems and is an important contribution to future studies associating biodiversity and climate change.

The primary objective of this study is to develop a stochastic daily rainfall model through coupling a Markov chain model with a rainfall event model (SDRM-MCREM) to simultaneously preserve the statistical properties of rainfall time series and rainfall events. The newly developed model is applied to the Qu River basin, East China and its performance is evaluated at catchment scale. Results demonstrate that SDRM-MCREM shows a good performance in reproducing most of the rainfall time-series statistics (i.e. rainfall percentiles, average monthly and annual rainfall, inter-monthly rainfall variability and extreme rainfall) and rainfall event characteristics (i.e. distributions of wet and dry spells, occurrence frequency of different rainfall event classes, temporal rainfall patterns and their occurrence frequency in different rainfall event classes). The statistics of average runoff and extreme runoff are also well preserved by using the SDRM-MCREM simulations as input of hydrological modelling except that the interannual variability of rainfall and runoff is slightly underestimated. Moreover, SDRM-MCREM shows a great potential to be used for flood and drought risk assessment in reproducing the exceedance probabilities of high flows (e.g. annual maximum 1-day, 3-day and 5-day mean runoff) and low flows (e.g. annual minimum 7-day, 30-day and 90-day mean runoff).

J	Sharifi, A				Sharifi, Ayyoob			Urban Resilience Assessment: Mapping Knowledge Structure and Trends	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						urban resilience assessment; science mapping; bibliometrics analysis; flooding; earthquake; critical infrastructure	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; EMERGING TRENDS; FRAMEWORK; VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKE; RECOVERY; SYSTEM; TOOLS	The literature on urban resilience assessment has grown rapidly over the past two decades. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the state of knowledge on urban resilience assessment through mapping the knowledge domain and highlighting emerging trends during different periods. The objects of study were 420 papers published in the Web of Science from 1998 to 2020. Science mapping was done using VOSviewer and CiteSpace, two widely known software tools for bibliometrics analysis and scientometric visualization. The results show that research published on urban resilience assessment was very limited and fragmented until 2009, and the focus has mainly been on risk mitigation and vulnerability assessment. The intellectual base grew between 2010 and 2014, when a paradigm shift from approaches based on robustness and reliability toward more adaptation-oriented approaches occurred. Finally, the annual publication trends have grown rapidly over the past five years and there has been more emphasis on climate change adaptation and flood resilience. Overall, in terms of dimensional focus, more attention has been paid to infrastructural, institutional, and environmental aspects at the expense of social and economic dimensions. In addition to information on thematic focus and evolution, this paper also provides other bibliometrics information on the influential authors, institutions, journals, and publications that lay the foundation of the field and can be used by various interested groups as points of reference to gain better knowledge about the structure and thematic evolution of urban resilience assessment. The paper concludes by highlighting gaps and making some recommendations for future improvement of the field. Major gaps are related to assessing resilience against socio-economic and health risks (e.g., economic recession and pandemics such as COVID-19).

Impact of Climate and Land Use Change on Streamflow and Sediment Yield in a Snow-Dominated Semiarid Mountainous Watershed	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Early Access						hydrologic modeling; climate downscaling; land use modeling; snowmelt; sediment; uncertainty	AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; FUTURE CLIMATE; SOIL-EROSION; HSPF MODEL; VARIABILITY; QUALITY; RUNOFF; PROJECTIONS; CATCHMENT; RESOURCES	This study investigates the impact of climate and land use change on the magnitude and timing of streamflow and sediment yield in a snow-dominated mountainous watershed in Salt Lake County, Utah using a scenario approach and the Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN model for the 2040s (year 2035-2044) and 2090s (year 2085-2094). The climate scenarios were statistically and dynamically downscaled from global climate models. Land use and land cover (LULC) changes were estimated in two ways - from a regional planning scenario and from a deterministic model. Results indicate the mean daily streamflow in the Jordan River watershed will increase by an amount ranging from 11.2% to 14.5% in the 2040s and from 6.8% to 15.3% in the 2090s. The respective increases in sediment load in the 2040s and 2090s is projected to be 6.7% and 39.7% in the canyons and about 7.4% to 14.2% in the Jordan valley. The historical 50th percentile timing of streamflow and sediment load is projected to be shifted earlier by three to four weeks by mid-century and four to eight weeks by late-century. The projected streamflow and sediment load results establish a nonlinear relationship with each other and are highly sensitive to projected climate change. The predicted changes in streamflow and sediment yield will have implications for water supply, flood control and stormwater management. Research Impact Statement: The future streamflow and sediment load in snowfed mountainous watersheds show strong sensitivity to future climate change. Sediment concentrations exhibit a nonlinear relationship with streamflow.	[Khatri, K. B.] Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Strong, C.; Kochanski, A.

J	Zhang, SD; Zhang, DD				Zhang, Shengda; Zhang, David Dian			Population-influenced spatiotemporal pattern of natural disaster and social crisis in China, AD1-1910	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Natural disaster; Social crisis; Population; Spatiotemporal pattern; Historical China	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH CHINA; TEMPERATURE-CHANGE; GROWTH DYNAMICS; EASTERN CHINA; YANGTZE DELTA; YELLOW-RIVER; IMPACTS; FLUCTUATIONS; EPIDEMICS	Researchers mostly ascribe contemporary natural disaster and the concomitant social crisis to anomalous climate change or global warming. However, whether such a relationship is still valid in long-term historical settings remains doubtful. In this study, data obtained from historical records about natural calamities (flood and drought) and their social impacts (famine, cannibalism, and war) at provincial and decadal scales during AD1-1910 are applied to mathematical statistics such as correlation and regression analysis as well as spatial visualization. Also, the role of population in the nexus of meteorological catastrophes and human miseries is investigated. Results show that at the provincial scale, generally there is high consistency among different variables and most of them are clustered in eastern part of China, especially in the north. More in-depth examinations indicate regional disparities that variables account for higher proportion in the south during the later imperial era, which may be attributed to the southward movement of population center. At the decadal scale, drought is the primary contributor to famine and cannibalism, while severe or even out-of-control famine i.e. cannibalism is more likely to incur war than ordinary famine per se. Besides, population growth rate exerts its positive effect on natural hazards and food crises, whereas more wars bring population loss and relieve population stress despite the weak negative association. These findings supplement previous views and confirm that the distributions of disasters in ancient China are affected by population rather than climatic variability, which only determines the occurrence of disaster.

J	Ziaja, S				Ziaja, Sonya			How Algorithm-Assisted Decision Making Is Influencing Environmental Law and Climate Adaptation	ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY			English	Article								embody bias and hidden values that affect equity and democracy. In effect, algorithm-based tools are new fora for law and policymaking, distinct from legislatures and courts. In turn, these tools influence the development and implementation of environmental law and regulation. As a practical matter, there is a pressing need to understand how these automated decision-making tools interact with and influence law and policy. This Article begins this timely and critical discussion. Though algorithmic decision making has been critiqued in other domains like policing and housing policy, climate change makes algorithms in environmental and energy policy distinct. Expectations of climatic stationarity-for example, how frequently or severely a coastal area floods or how many days of extreme heat an energy system needs to anticipate-are no longer valid. Algorithm-based tools are necessary to make sense of possible future scenarios in an unstable climate. Yet, dependence on these tools brings with it a conflict between technocracy (and the need to rapidly adapt and respond to climate change) and democratic participation, which is fundamental to equity. This Article discusses sources of that tension within algorithm-based tools and offers a pathway forward to integrate values of equity and democratic participation into these tools. After introducing the challenge of adapting water and energy systems to climate change, this Article synthesizes prior multidisciplinary work on algorithmic decision making and modeling-informed governance-bringing together the works of early climate scientists and contemporary leaders in algorithmic decision making. From this synthesis, this Article presents a framework for analyzing how well these tools integrate principles of equity, including procedural and substantive fairness-both of which are essential to democracy. The framework evaluates how the tools handle uncertainty, transparency, and stakeholder collaboration across two attributes. The first attribute has to do with the model itself-specifically, how and whether existing law and policy are incorporated into these tools. These social parameters can be incorporated as inputs to the model or in the structure of the model, which determines its logic. The second attribute has to do with the modeling process-how and whether stakeholders and end-users collaborated in the model's development. The Article then applies this framework and compares two algorithm-assisted decision-making tools currently in use for adapting water and energy systems to climate change. The first tool is called "INFORM." It is used to allocate water quantity and flow on the Sacramento River, while taking climate and weather into account. The second tool is called "RESOLVE." It is used by energy utility regulators in California to evaluate scenarios for energy generation. Although the development of both tools involved collaborative processes, there are meaningful distinctions in the history of their development and use. The comparisons indicate that how law and policy are incorporated into the underlying code of models influences the development and regulation of climate adaptation, while inclusiveness and collaboration during the model's development influences the model's perceived usefulness and adoption. Both conclusions have implications for equity and accessibility of environmental, natural resource, and energy planning.

It is also the site of frequent floods, droughts, and other natural disasters. Conducting Holocene environmental archaeology research in this region is of great importance when studying the evolution of the relationship between humans and the environment and the interactive effects humans had on the environment from 10.0 to 3.0 ka BP, for which no written records exist. This review provides a comprehensive summary of materials that have been published over the past several decades concerning Holocene environmental archaeology in the Yangtze River Valley, to further understand large-scale regional Holocene environmental and cultural interaction within this area. The results show that: (1) in recent years, Holocene envi-ronmental archaeology research in the Yangtze River Valley has primarily taken paleoflood and sea-level change stratigraphical events to be the foundational threads for study. This began with research on the spatiotemporal distribution of archaeological sites, typical archaeological site stratigraphy, and research on background features concerning environmental evolution recorded by the regional natural sedimentary strata. (2) Significant progress has been made at the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, indicating that Holocene environmental ar-chaeology research along the Yangtze River Valley is deepening and broadening. (3) Dramatic changes to Neolithic cultures that occurred approximately 4.0 ka BP were influenced by climate change and associated consequences, although the impacts differed on the various Neolithic cultures in the Yangtze River Valley. Local topography, regional climate, and varying survival strategies may have contributed to these differences. (4) Newly-published research pays particular attention to the sedimentary records of the past with resolutions as high as one year to several months, the degree to which humans altered the quality of their natural environment, and human adjustments to settlement and subsistence practices during periods of Holocene climate change. The application of technologies such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and molecular biological analysis are also gradually being extended into the research field of Holocene environmental archaeology in the Yangtze River Valley.

J	Safaryan, S; Tavakoli, M; Rostami, N; Ebrahimi, H				Safaryan, Soheila; Tavakoli, Mohsen; Rostami, Noredin; Ebrahimi, Haidar			Evaluation of climate change effects on extreme flows in a catchment of western Iran	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; extreme flows; Ilam dam watershed; Iran	STREAMFLOW RESPONSE; IMPACTS; BASIN	Investigation of the relationship between catchment hydrology with climate is essential for understanding of the impact of future climate on hydrological extremes, which may cause frequent flooding, drought, and shortage of water supply. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of climate change on extreme flows in one of the subcatchments of the Ilam dam catchment, Iran. The changes in climate parameters were predicted using the outputs of HadCM3 model for up to the end of the current century in three time periods including 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. For A2 scenario, increases of 1.09 degrees C, 2.03 degrees C, and 3.62 degrees C, and for B2 scenario rises of 1.18 degrees C, 1.84 degrees C, and 2.55 degrees C have been predicted. The results suggest that for A2 scenario, the amount of precipitation would decrease by 12.63, 49.13, and 63.42 and for B2 scenario by 47.02, 48.51, and 70.26 mm per year. Also the values of PET for A2 scenario would increase by 51.18, 101.47 and 108.71 and for B2 scenario by 60.09, 89.86, and 124.32 mm per year. The results of running the SWAT model revealed that the average annual runoff would decrease by 0.11, 0.41, and 0.61 m(3)/s and for B2 scenario by 0.39, 0.47, and 0.59 (3)/s. The extreme flows were then analyzed by running WETSPRO model. According to the results, the amounts of low flows for A2 scenario will decrease by 0.02, 0.21 and 0.33 (3)/s and for B2 scenario by 0.19, 0.26 and 0.29 (3)/s in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. On the other hand, the results show an increase of peak flows by 11.5, 19.1 and 48.7 (3)/s in A2 scenario and 11.12, 25.93 and 48.1 (3)/s in B2 scenario, respectively. Overall, the results indicated that an increase in return period leads to elevated levels of high flows and diminished low flows.

Failure to include land use planning and poorly designed urban drainage system aggravates the problem of urban flood. The integration of geographic information system, and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique were used for flood hazards and risk mapping. Five factors namely slope, elevation, drainage density, land use land cover, and soil data were used for flood hazards and risk mapping. Agrowing urban population increases the risk of flood victims during the rainy season. Results revealed that about 25.16 and 24.38% of the study area is categorized under very high and high flood hazards, respectively. The topographic nature of the study area increases flood risk and hazards. The increaseing number of people living in the city has led to the conversion of previously occupied green lands into residential areas aggravates flood hazards and risk. Flood mitigation measures such as better land use planning, public awareness creation on flood hazards and risks, delineation of flood risk areas during the rainy seasons, increasing greenery, strengthening river side development, and watershed management in the catchment are urgently required. The findings of this study can provide a theoretical background for flood hazards risk mitigation and prevention.

Adopting climate-proof policies and strategies in response to climate change has become a fundamental element for city planning. To this end, this research considers a multidisciplinary approach, at the local scale, able to connect urban planning and architecture, as a vital base for considering a coastal cities' ability to control the consequences of climate change, specifically floods. So far, there is a scarcity of research connecting sea ground and land surveys, and this study could become a foundational reference for coastline settlement management using BIM. We found in BIM (Building Information Modeling) a possible tool for managing coastal risk, since it can combine crowdsourced data for geometric and information modeling of the city. The proposed BIM model includes a topography used for 3D thematic maps, a riverbed model, and a waterway model. This model aims to facilitate coordination across separate actors and interests since the urban area model is always updatable and improvable. Focusing on a case study of Lisbon, we developed risk-based 3D maps of the area close to the shoreline of the Tagus River.

Herein, we provide our perspective on the importance of natural flows, large floods in particular, for successful conservation and rehabilitation of riverscapes. We present ideas developed from our experience with rehabilitation projects across multiple desert tributary rivers with varying levels of habitat degradation and water abstraction. We propose spatially extensive measures such as protection of in-stream flows, tailoring rehabilitation efforts to available annual water availability, and working with nature using low-tech process-based techniques to more completely address the mechanisms of habitat degradation, such as flow reduction and vegetation-induced channel narrowing. Traditionally, rehabilitation efforts in the Colorado River basin take place at relatively small spatial extents, at convenient locations and, largely focus on reducing non-native plant and fish species. We suggest that we need to think more broadly and creatively, and that conservation or recovery of natural flow regimes is crucial to long-term success of almost all management efforts for both in-stream and riparian communities.

However, many people affected by emerging coastal changes remain in sites of residence. Here we examine the experiences of residents in three low-lying villages across two small island states: Dreketi and Karoko in Fiji, and Funafala in Tuvalu. Analysis of qualitative data from interviews shows that residents are concerned about local coastal changes, and largely attribute them to climate change. While some anticipate future relocation and retreat, and a few households have retreated short distances away from the coast, for now residents remain in and move to these sites to maintain livelihoods, practices, well-being, and sense of belonging. These are places that people value and plan to live in as long as possible. The contribution of this paper is to highlight the vernacular explanations of overlapping drivers of immobility and translocality in sites of coastal risk. It indicates the need to move away from the binaries of immobility/mobility and of trapped/voluntarily immobile populations and to examine the multiplicities of human (im)mobility.

Over the years, several hydrological models have been developed in different parts of the world. Two such semi-distributed hydrologic models are SWAT and HEC-HMS. In this study, a comparative analysis has been carried out to evaluate the performance of these two distributed hydrological models as a flood forecasting tool. The Alkhnanda and Bhagirathi rivers, which flow into the Tehri Reservoir, Uttarakhand and pass through Tehri, Uttarkashi and Chamoli districts of Uttarakhand, India, are selected for the analysis. The performance of these two models is evaluated by using standard statistical methods. The comparative analysis of these two models shows that the SWAT model is performing slightly better in comparison to the HEC-HMS model, especially in the lean period. The underestimation of peak discharge may be due to the contribution of significant snowmelt discharge during the rainy season. The models are also used to predict future discharge under different climate change scenarios. The future prediction shows that the peak discharge of Alkhnanda may be increased by 27 and 47% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively.

Although studies have shown that strong storms can negatively impact Arctic ecosystems, the impact of storms on Arctic marine mammals is relatively unknown. In July 2016, an unusually large storm occurred in the Mackenzie Delta while instrumented seabed moorings equipped with hydrophones and oceanographic sensors were in place to study environmental drivers of beluga habitat use during their summer aggregation. The storm lasted up to 88 h, with maximum wind speeds reaching 60 km/h; historical wind data from Tuktoyaktuk revealed a storm of similar duration has not occurred in July in at least the past 28 years. This provided a unique opportunity to study the impacts of large storms on oceanographic conditions, beluga habitat use, and the traditional subsistence hunt that occurs annually in the delta. The storm resulted in increased water levels and localized flooding as well as a significant drop in water temperature (similar to 10 degrees C) and caused belugas to leave the area for 5 days. Although belugas returned after the storm ended, the subsistence hunt was halted resulting in the lowest beluga harvest between 1978 and 2017.

This study investigates patterns in the soil's response to major rainfall events in mountainous areas and proposes a new approach for resilient disaster prevention technology and recovery based on the effect of soil runoff. Namhyeon-dong within Seoul was selected for the case study because of its vulnerable location between two mountains. A master plan was developed to cope with the predicted soil runoff based on the annual rainfall, local land use and a series of 10-year forecasts covering the period from 2021 to 2100. A total of 22 catchments in the study area were analyzed with Arc Hydro, an ArcGIS plug-in and appropriate technologies proposed to deal with the soil runoff likely to be experienced in each catchment in an extreme disaster. The resulting model was deemed adequate to deal with disasters during the period predicted to represent the highest risk, 2051-2060. The study's findings will help to forecast disasters from flood that could impact residential areas in mountainous regions, to predict the magnitude of potential soil disasters in individual regions and develop design guidelines for disaster prevention technology based on the predicted amount of soil runoff.

There were several floods events recorded in Chennai, a one of the major metropolitan coastal city in India. The flood incidences were repeatedly reported in recent decades. In this study, the existing state of storm water drains are evaluated under current and future climate scenarios in one of the most flood-prone areas of Chennai viz. Velachery zone. The mitigation measures are recommended to increase its resilience against floods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) CMIP5 models of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 are used to develop possible future climate change scenarios of the city. The daily rainfall data for the period 1975-2015 obtained from India Meteorological Department are used to find the extremities and to generate Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. The IDF curves are generated for 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 year return period under current and future climate scenarios. The storm drainage network are delineated with Differential Geographic Positioning System (DGPS) survey. The integrated hydraulic and hydrological modelling is carried out to assess the flood carrying capacity of storm drainage under present and future climate scenarios. The vulnerable hotspots are identified and flood mitigation measures are suggested to reduce the flood risk at Velachery.

Following the event characterization and process analysis in Part 1, here we put the 2021 event in the historical context regarding precipitation and discharge records and in terms of the temporal transformation of the valley morphology. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of ongoing and future climate change on the modification of rainfall totals and the associated flood hazard, as well as implications for flood management. The event was among the five heaviest precipitation events of the past 70 years in Germany. However, consideration of the large LAERTES-EU regional climate model (RCM) ensemble revealed a substantial underestimation of both return levels and periods based on extreme value statistics using only observations. An analysis of homogeneous hydrological data of the last 70 years demonstrated that the event discharges exceeded by far the statistical 100-year return levels. Nevertheless, the flood peaks at the Ahr river were comparable to the reconstructed major historical events of 1804 and 1910, which were not included in the flood risk assessment so far. A comparison between the 2021 and past events showed differences in terms of the observed hydro-morphodynamic processes which enhanced the flood risk due to changes in the landscape organization and occupation. The role of climate change and how the 2021 event would unfold under warmer or colder conditions (within a -2 to +3K range) was considered based on both a pseudo global warming (PGW) model experiments and the analysis of an RCM ensemble. The PGW experiments showed that the spatial mean precipitation scales with the theoretical ClausiusClapeyron (CC) relation, predicting a 7% to 9% increase per degree of warming. Using the PGW rainfall simulations as input to a hydrological model of the Ahr river basin revealed a strong and non-linear effect on flood peaks: for the +2K scenario, the 18% increase in areal rainfall led to a 39% increase of the flood peak at gauge Altenahr. The analysis of the high-resolution convection-permitting KIT-KLIWA RCM ensemble confirmed the CC scaling for moderate spatial mean precipitation but showed a super CC scaling of up to 10% for higher intensities. Moreover, the spatial extent of such precipitation events is also expected to increase.

A multiproxy study, based on sedimentological descriptions, together with mineralogy, carbonate content, XRF core scanning and biological proxies supported by AMS C-14 dates, were applied to the 3-m-long core extracted from "Flowers Marsh", a small Middle Atlas pond. This approach provides evidence for a continuous paleohydrological and paleoenvironmental record during the Mid- to Late Holocene. The investigated aquatic system evolved from a dry or very shallow waterbody towards a system with a progressively rising water level. The dominance of the detrital fraction with poor preservation of bioindicators and eroded pollen, indicate the existence of an ephemeral waterbody from 6000 cal. yr BP until a transitional phase characterized by new sedimentological facies and the appearance of ostracods around 2300 cal. yr BP. This transition, ending at 2000 cal. yr BP, is interpreted as a flooding phase leading to an ephemeral lake. It is certainly fed by the excess water from the nearby Aguelmam Azigza Lake during its high level period. Afterwards, enhanced organic matter deposition and the appearance of well-preserved diatoms until 1400 cal. yr BP corroborate a high water-level trend. Endogenic carbonate to detrital fraction ratios indicate fluctuating, but generally shallow, water levels from 1400 cal. yr BP until 650 cal. yr BP when a relatively rapid rise in water level occurred. Flowers Marsh data are, generally, consistent with most of the existing regional records. The highstand period recorded between 2000 and 1400 cal. yr is a common feature extending to more distant sites from the northern Mediterranean. It corresponds to the wetter Iberian-Roman period. Fluctuating shallow water levels recorded since 1400 cal. yr BP to now could be linked to drier/wetter phases associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age (650- 150 cal. yr BP) respectively, in the western Mediterranean realm. The present study demonstrates the ability of Flowers Marsh to record valuable palaeohydrological changes since the Mid-Holocene and confirms the high sensitivity of Middle Atlas hydrosystems to climatic changes.

J	Zhang, MM; Chen, F; Guo, HD; Yi, L; Zeng, JY; Li, B				Zhang, Meimei; Chen, Fang; Guo, Huadong; Yi, Lu; Zeng, Jiangyuan; Li, Bin			Glacial Lake Area Changes in High Mountain Asia during 1990-2020 Using Satellite Remote Sensing	RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER INDEX NDWI; OUTBURST FLOODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MASS BALANCES; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; TIBETAN PLATEAU; INVENTORY; EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; KARAKORAM	Changes in a large-scale glacial lake area directly reflect the regional glacier status and climate changes. However, long time series of glacial lake dataset and comprehensive investigation of the spatiotemporal changes in the glacial lake area in the whole High Mountain Asia (HMA) region remained elusive. Satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable way for dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes over large regions. But glacial lakes are quite small and discretely distributed, and the extraction of glacial lakes is usually influenced by clouds, snow/ice cover, and terrain shadows; thus, there is a lack of an automatic method to continuously monitor the dynamic changes of glacial lakes in a large scale. In this paper, we developed a per-pixel composited method named the "multitemporal mean NDWI composite" to automatically extract the glacial lake area in HMA from 1990 to 2020 using time-series Landsat data. There were 19,294 glacial lakes covering a total area of 1471.85 +/- 366.42 k m2 in 1990, and 22,646 glacial lakes with an area of 1729.08 +/- 461.31 km(2) in 2020. It is noted that the glacial lake area in the whole HMA region expanded by 0.58 +/- 0.21%/a over the past three decades, with high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The glacial lake area increased at a consistent speed over time. The fastest expansion was in East Kun Lun at an average rate of 2.01 +/- 0.54%/a, while in the Pamir and Hengduan Shan, they show slow increases with rates of 0.33 +/- 0.08%/a and 0.39 +/- 0.01 %/a, respectively, during 1990-2020. The greatest increase in lake area occurred at 5000-5200 m a.s.l., which increased by about 45 km(2) (similar to 25%). We conclude that the temperature rise and glacier thinning are the leading factors of glacial lake expansion in HMA, and precipitation is the main source of lake water increase in West Kun Lun. Using the proposed method, a large amount of Landsat images from successive years of melting seasons can be fully utilized to obtain a pixel-level composited cloud-free and solid snow/ice-free glacial lake map.

With obliterated infrastructure and rising disease burden, the nation is still reeling from the dismal aftermath. It is critical to understand that such catastrophes are not a 1-time calamity but are likely to become more frequent with growing severity of the climate crisis. These losses point to a more systemic problem that is a lack of preparedness, and without sustainable long-term measures in place, the nation remains just as vulnerable to the next 'unpredictable' weather contingency. Prior planning and effective allocation of resources can help develop a proactive response to future disasters of this magnitude.

The challenges in each phase of rescue, relief and rebuilding were addressed in this case study. Through the strategic use of 'ecospatiality; it is shown that the 'state-society synergy' does exist in its potentiality, although, by and large, it is ignored in already existing 'riskscape' scholarship. However, the context of this study proves to be an ideal site for illustrating the possibilities of actualising this latent potential through ecospatiality planning. Such attempts can, at the same time, be of local effectiveness and global significance.	[Raman, K.

Flooding and several ground failures such as landslides and riverbank erosion caused significant damage and interrupted the main transportation corridors, including major highways and railroads, severing land connectivity between Metro Vancouver and the rest of Canada. In this short note, we summarize and describe slope and riverbank ground failures in the Lower Mainland and connecting corridors to the interior such as the Fraser Canyon and the Coquihalla Valley, with focus on those that produced damage on highways. Field observations are discussed in the context of potential future similar disasters in the region due to more frequent extreme climatic events associated with climate change.

A better comprehension of these impacts and their conditions is consequently needed. Hence, this paper presents a state-of-the-art literature review on flood impact assessment in "metro" systems, analysing their purposes and their shortcomings.

The lockdown measures were ineffective with no sign of flattening the curve. Therefore, the high risk of transmission is evident with an increasing number of affected people. Under this circumstance, a multiple hazards scenario can be developed in this country due to climatic hazards such as cyclones, floods, landslides, heat waves, and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The country experiences simultaneously the global pandemic, exceptionally prolonged flood along with the recovery stage from the damages due to the cyclone (Amphan). Therefore, these multiple factors have been putting pressure on losing millions of homes, livelihoods, and agricultural crops. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of a simultaneous strike of climatic hazards and infectious disease outbreaks and their possible strategic management in Bangladesh under different scenarios. A mixed methodological approach was followed in this study including a questionnaire survey, in-depth discussion with experts, and extensive literature review to assess the multi-hazard scenario in a resource-limited setting with high population density. A set of statistical techniques were used to analyze the responses (n = 1590) from different social groups (healthcare professionals, academicians, students, Government and NGO officials, and businessman) under three scenarios. The results revealed the high possibility of aggravating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic if there is a climatic hazard such as flood, cyclone have appeared. The majority of the respondents agreed that the situation will become more devastating if there is another outbreak of diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The poor and fragile healthcare system of this country cannot bear such unprecedented pressure. The lack of risk assessment and communication, lack of sectoral coordination might restrict the contingency plan of the government. Therefore, considering the unprecedented worst cases a stringent strategic plan for emergency response, short term and long-term management should have to be formulated. Resilience building through proactive planning and implementation of integrated, inclusive and sustainable strategies will be effective to ensure the health and socio-economic security for multi-hazard threats in the country.

Haor households are attempting to diversify their livelihood activities to protect themselves from such extreme climate events. The study's aim to evaluate the various livelihood strategies adopted by haor households, and multinomial logistic regression is employed to identify the factors influencing their decision to pursue more eco-friendly and sustainable livelihood strategies. A multi-stage stratified random sampling technique was used to collect primary data from 300 haor households in Kishoreganj, Netrokona, and Sunamganj districts, with 100 from each district. We provide inimitable insight into the analysis to understand how livelihood resources, livelihood strategies, and livelihood outcomes are closely tied in the framework for sustainable rural livelihoods. The study classified a household's economic activities into five distinct categories, together with crop farming. Among the livelihood options, crop plus livestock rearing is the most productive livelihood strategy for haor households. The findings revealed that the household's head age and education, dependency ratio, land holdings, household assets value, access to credit, annual income, membership of any organization, home to road, market, and haor distances, communication during the dry season, duration of waterlogged, and agro-ecology of the haor ecosystem all have a significant impact on the choice of higher returning livelihood diversification strategies. Policies should attempt to promote the significant determinants of livelihood strategies choice, as well as should ensure livelihood assets, a strong infrastructure, and minimize natural hazards, in order to transform the local context and enable poor households to build more profitable livelihood strategies.

Yet, they have been heavily modified by land use, technical flood protection measures, and hydropower installations. Fish species requiring specific habitats to complete their life cycle have strongly declined and therefore become target species of river restoration measures. This study compared abiotic conditions and fish community composition of three bank habitat types in a large alpine river, comprising different degrees of alteration compared to the natural state (concrete profile, bank riprap, and naturally restored riverbank). Significant differences in abiotic habitat characteristics such as bed material, water depth, turbidity, submerged vegetation, and temperature were detected between the three bank habitat types and sampling seasons. These water level-dependent structural changes had the strongest effect on fish community composition as detected by distance-based linear modeling. Small specimens between 3 and 13 cm TL and juveniles were most abundant in the restored areas, except for Lota lota, which was most abundant in the man-made bank riprap. Target species of conservation were mostly detected in restored areas, particularly the critical young life stages of Chondrostoma nasus, Barbus barbus, and Thymallus thymallus. Water level strongly determined accessibility and suitability of bank habitats, with shallow, gravel-dominated habitats comprising flat bank angles being most beneficial for these species. The findings of this study provide evidence for the success of bank habitat restoration in structurally impacted alpine rivers on target species of conservation. Fluctuating water levels and discharges typical for alpine rivers should be better considered in restoration planning, particularly in light of climate change, affecting the timing and amplitude of discharge in these systems.

J	Cavender, N; Donnelly, G				Cavender, Nicole; Donnelly, Gerard			Intersecting urban forestry and botanical gardens to address big challenges for healthier trees, people, and cities	PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET			English	Article						arboreta; botanical gardens; cities; climate change; environmental services; global urbanization; human health; human well-being; trees; urban forestry; urban greening		Societal Impact Statement The need for urban greening increases with global urbanization. Trees are major assets to livable urban areas, providing valuable environmental services to combat challenges such as pollution, urban heat, and flooding, as well as to improve social cohesion, human health, and well-being. Investments in tree planting and arboriculture yield valuable returns, but trees face many challenges in the unnatural and stressful urban environment and in a rapidly changing climate. Botanical gardens have expertise in growing plants in designed landscapes. We urge their increased involvement with urban forestry to improve sustainability of cities and human lives. Summary Improving urban forests is one of the solutions to achieving several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and making cities healthier and more livable for people. Priority should be given to protecting mature trees and promoting long-lived trees in the future. Achievement of this goal requires recognition of the myriad stresses trees face in built landscapes as well as the challenges related to climate change. Because all people living in communities are affected by the urban forest, developing solutions and forestry action plans should be a social endeavor and include diverse partnerships. Botanical gardens and arboreta can provide key resources in support of these efforts. They have a significant public reach, maintain a strong professional network, and can make important contributions to address key priorities including (a) protecting existing trees; (b) improving tree selection, diversity, and age structure; and (c) improving planning, standards, training, and management. A focus on below-ground aspects, such as root development and soil composition, is a critical component for success. Horticultural and scientific knowledge combined with extensive public reach make botanical gardens and arboreta important potential partners in achieving urban forest objectives, but a greater call to action is needed.

The case of Krakow's historical town centre, which is protected as a historical site by national law and it was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List in 1978, clearly demonstrates how difficult it is to reconcile the passive character of current conservation doctrines with the demands of the free market and growth-oriented economy, when developer pressure is not sufficiently balanced out by public opinion and urban activist movements, when planning tools are incomplete or insufficient, and the criteria according to which strategic decisions are made are of a quantitative rather than a qualitative character. Apart from commonly encountered problems that are associated with the gentrification of town centres or the negative impact of mass tourism, Krakow must also face a growing flood hazard that stems from its specific and unfavourable hydrological and hydrogeological conditions that are compounded by the uncontrolled and uncoordinated expansion of urbanised areas, the decay of the natural environment, and the consequences of climate change. This article presents the multi-aspect site-specific conditions of the historical centre of Krakow, as well as the analysis of its protection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in the context of flood protection, while taking into consideration the environmental, economic, and social dimension of heritage. The critical conclusions that are featured in the work indicate both areas of possible immediate remedial action and the potential directions that new integrated protection strategies would take.

Although the impacts of large hydropower plants have been well documented in the literature, few studies have been conducted on the impacts of small cascaded hydropower plants (SCHPs). To evaluate the impacts of SCHPs on river flow, we chose a representative basin affected by hydropower projects and, to a lesser degree, by other human activities, that is, the Qiuxiang River basin in Southern China. The observed river discharge and climate data during the period of 1958-2016 were investigated. The datasets were divided into a low-impact period and a high-impact period based on the number of SCHPs and the capacities of the reservoirs. The daily river discharge alteration was assessed by applying the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. To separate the impact of the SCHPs on the local river discharge from that of climate-related precipitation, the back-propagation neural network was used to simulate the monthly average river discharge process. An abnormal result was found: Unlike large reservoirs in large watersheds, the SCHPs regulated the flows during the flood season but were not able to mitigate the droughts during the dry season due to their limited storage and the commonly occurring inappropriate interregulations of the SCHPs. The SCHPs also reduced the annual average river discharge in the research basin. The contribution of the SCHPs to the river discharge changes was 85.37%, much higher than the contributions of climate change (13.43%) and other human activities (1.20%). The results demonstrated that the impacts of the SCHPs were different from those of large dams and reservoirs that regulate floods and relieve droughts. It is necessary to raise the awareness of the impacts of these river barriers.

Drought ecohydrology alters the structure and function of benthic invertebrate communities in mountain streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; flow regime; headwaters; Sierra Nevada; stream biodiversity	MEDITERRANEAN-CLIMATE STREAMS; SIERRA-NEVADA; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; HEADWATER STREAMS; FLOW; CALIFORNIA; TRAITS; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; DIVERSITY	We studied benthic macroinvertebrate communities in 12 mid-elevation mountain streams in the Sierra Nevada, California. Data were collected at nine times (seven springs and two autumns) over a 14-year period of variable hydrological conditions, including years of flood and extreme unprecedented drought. The taxonomic and trait structures of communities were similar during wet and average springs but became increasingly different as drought continued and smaller streams became intermittent. The density of total invertebrates, primarily chironomids, increased during the drought years, but the richness and abundance of mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly (EPT) taxa declined during the late drought. During the late drought, the proportions of rheophilic, semivoltine taxa with clinger or swimmer behavioural habits decreased, whereas small, stress-tolerant taxa with burrower and climber habits increased. Collector-gatherers dominated in all periods, but during the severe drought the relative abundance of micropredators increased and filterers, shredders, and grazers decreased. We also found greater changes in community structure between spring runoff and autumn base flow conditions in an average than a wet year. However, spring to autumn population growth rates were much greater during the wet than average year. Invertebrate richness and EPT abundance decreased and community structure showed large changes when stream discharge fell below 1-10L/s, but remained relatively constant across a range of higher flows. During the severe drought, there were significant declines in the densities of 40% of the common EPT taxa compared to average and wet years, but chironomid, mite, and other invertebrate taxa showed variable responses. Invertebrate diversity, community structure, and ecosystem functions in small, headwater streams are especially vulnerable to drought conditions, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change in the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions.

River Geomorphology Affects Biogeochemical Responses to Hydrologic Events in a Large River Ecosystem	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						large river; concentration-discharge; hysteresis; high discharge event	UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; SUSPENDED-SOLIDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; NITRATE; DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY; IMPACTS; EXPORT	Shifts in the frequency and intensity of high discharge events due to climate change may have important consequences for the hydrology and biogeochemistry of rivers. However, our understanding of event-scale biogeochemical dynamics in large rivers lags that of small streams. To fill this gap, we used high-frequency sensor data collected during four consecutive summers from a main channel and backwater site of the Upper Mississippi River. We identified high discharge events and calculated event concentration-discharge responses for both physical-chemical (nitrate, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter) and biological (chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria) constituents using metrics of hysteresis and slope. We found a range of responses across events, particularly for nitrate. Although fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) and turbidity exhibited more consistent responses across events, contrasting hysteresis metrics indicated that FDOM was flushed to the river from more distant sources than turbidity. Biological responses (chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria) differed more between sites than physical and chemical constituents. Lastly, we found that the event characteristics best explaining concentration responses differed between sites, with event magnitude more frequently related to responses in the main channel, and antecedent wetness conditions associated with response variation in the backwater. Our results indicate that event responses in large rivers are distinct across the diverse habitats and biogeochemical components of a large floodplain river, which has implications for local and downstream ecosystems as the climate shifts. Plain Language Summary How sediment, nutrients, and organic matter enters and moves throughout large rivers has important implications for water quality both locally and globally. One way to study these dynamics is to observe how these materials react to periods of high streamflow. We used this approach to analyze sources and movement of nitrate, organic matter, sediment, and biological indicators in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). The data indicated that sediment and organic matter likely came from sources that were closer and farther from the river, respectively, and that these patterns were more evident during more extreme high streamflow periods. We also found that materials, particularly biological indicators (chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria), behaved differently in the main channel of the river compared to a slower-flowing backwater area. These results are relevant to management of water quality in the UMR, particularly given that high streamflow periods will likely increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change.

J	Kalfin; Sukono; Supian, S; Mamat, M				Kalfin; Sukono; Supian, Sudradjat; Mamat, Mustafa			Insurance as an Alternative for Sustainable Economic Recovery after Natural Disasters: A Systematic Literature Review	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						natural disasters; risk; insurance; sustainable economic recovery; systematic literature review	FLOOD RISK; EARTHQUAKE; EFFICIENCY; INDUSTRY	The risk of natural disasters has increased over the last few decades, leading to significant economic losses across the globe. In response, research related to the risk of economic loss due to natural disasters has continued to develop. At present, insurance remains the best solution for funding such losses. The purpose of this study is to analyse the development of insurance as an alternative for sustainable economic recovery after natural disasters. The data used are articles obtained from several sources indexed by Scopus and Google Scholar. The search resulted in a final database of 266 articles, culled from a total of 813 articles before the final selection was made. The articles used are publications from 2000-2021 (including 21 database periods), to which we applied a systematic literature review method. Identification and evaluation of the articles was carried out through visualization of their content, development of disaster risk insurance, and availability of disaster risk insurance by country and type. The identification results show that the relationship between the word "insurance", according to visualization using the VOSviewer software, has a relationship with other clusters including the words "disaster", "disaster insurance", "risk", "natural disaster", "study", "recovery", and "disaster risk financing". The 266 articles studied show that there was an annual increase in the number of published scientific papers over the period 2000-2021. The types of disaster risk insurance, based on a review of the articles, include agricultural insurance, flood insurance, property insurance, earthquake insurance, crop insurance, and natural disaster insurance. In addition, of the six types of disaster risk insurance, three have been discussed the most in the last five years, namely, agricultural, flood, and property insurance. The increase in the number of scientific publications discussing these three types of disaster risk insurance has been influenced by climate change. Climate change causes a significant increase in the potential for disasters and is accompanied by an increased risk of loss. This review is expected to provide information and motivation for researchers related to the development and importance of disaster risk insurance research. Research in the risk sector for disaster losses due to climate change should be continued in the future in order to help fund economic recovery, especially throughout the insurance sector. With continuous research on disaster risk insurance, it is hoped that the resulting information can be more effective in determining insurance risk and in helping local economies and communities recover after the advent of a disaster. With the availability of funds for post-disaster recovery, the regional economy affected by the disaster can be immediately restored and recovered from adversity.

J	Mcgrath, GS; Harding, C; Matte, P				Mcgrath, Gavan S.; Harding, Carolyn; Matte, Pascal			Changing processes flooding a salt marsh in a microtidal estuary with a drying climate	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Salt marsh; Estuary; Tides; River; Climate change; Stability	RIVER FLOW; SEA-LEVEL; NONSTATIONARY; HYDROPERIOD; SALINITY; TIDE; VARIABILITY; EXPLORATION; DYNAMICS	Estuarine salt marshes globally face numerous threats, not least of which include changing hydrological conditions from human alteration and climate change impact to river flows, sea levels and coastal processes. While changing inundation is evident in many systems, often, the detail of which estuarine processes are changing and to what extent they contribute to flooding and habitat distribution remains unknown. Water levels in the microtidal Swan River Estuary (Derbarl Yerrigan), Western Australia, which has experienced significant climate drying since the 1970's, were disaggregated to assess contributions from tides, mean sea level, barometric effects, river flows and river-tide interactions. These contributions were mapped to the habitat of a salt marsh community. The effect of declining river flows on tides were further assessed by wavelet and harmonic analyses. We found that tides and barometric effects presently dominate flooding events of relevance to the salt marsh community. Declining winter runoff resulted in an increase in the tidal amplitude in the upper estuary. There was also a positive winter mean sea level pressure trend, associated with the winter rainfall decline. Altogether, there was zero net change to flooding of a salt marsh in the estuary from these processes. Therefore, steady sea level rise masked changes in the relative contribution of flooding mechanisms in the estuary which have implications for the stability of the marsh ecosystem. Disaggregating process contributions to salt marsh water levels offers a means to better assess the hydrodynamic processes presently sustaining salt marsh communities and to inform how they might change in the future. These results show that numerous hydrological processes can interact to mask non-stationary changes to estuarine hydrology supporting salt marsh habitat.

J	Harrell, J; Nijssen, B; Frans, C				Harrell, Jane; Nijssen, Bart; Frans, Chris			Where and When Does Streamflow Regulation Significantly Affect Climate Change Outcomes in the Columbia River Basin?	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						hydrology; climate change; streamflow; regulation; Columbia River basin; water resources	PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; 21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE; HYDROLOGIC EXTREMES; UNITED-STATES; LAND-SURFACE; FLOOD RISK; IMPACTS; MODEL; WATER; INCREASES	The Columbia River basin is a large transboundary basin located in the Pacific Northwest. The basin spans seven US states and one Canadian province, encompassing a diverse range of hydroclimates. Strong seasonality and complex topography are projected to give rise to spatially heterogeneous climate effects on unregulated streamflow. The basin's water resources are economically critical, and regulation across the domain is extensive. Many sensitivity studies have investigated climate impacts on the basin's naturalized hydrology; however, few have considered the large role of regulation. This study investigates where and when regulation affects projected changes in streamflow by comparing climate outcomes across 80-member ensembles of unregulated and regulated streamflow projections at 75 sites across the basin. Unregulated streamflow projections are taken from an existing data set of climate projections derived from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 Global Climate Models. Regulated streamflow projections were modeled by the US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Bureau of Reclamation by using these unregulated flows as input to hydro-regulation models that simulate operations based on current and historical water demands. Regulation dampens shifts in winter and summer streamflow volumes. Regulation generally attenuates changes in cool-season high flow extremes but amplifies shifts in warm-season and annual high flow extremes at historically snow-dominant headwater reservoirs. Regulation reduces dry-season low flow changes in headwater tributaries where regulation is large but elsewhere has little effect on changes in low flows. Results highlight the importance of accounting for water management in climate sensitivity analysis particularly in snow-dominant basins.

Increased frequency of extreme rainfall events threatens an emblematic cultural coastal agroecosystem in Southeastern Thailand	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Rainfall trend; Adaptation; Vulnerability; Agroforestry system	SEA-LEVEL; RESILIENCE; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; TREND; TESTS	Coastal agricultural systems in Southeast Asia are vulnerable to climate change. The combination of rising sea levels and extreme rainfall events is eroding fragile coastlines that protect emblematic "rice bowls" across the region. A series of recent damaging floods in Southeastern Thailand has raised concerns about their increased frequency. Local and regional trends in rainfall variables relevant to farming were investigated using the resampling-based Mann-Kendall test applied to four rainfall stations of the Songkhla lagoon basin during the period 1957-2019. Using the findings from long-term and multi-scale agrarian change surveys based on Mazoyer and Roudard's methodology, a vulnerability framework was used to assess the sensitivity and response capacity to these trends of the great Songkhla spit agroecosystem. Significant positive trends in the rainfall depth, number of rainy days, and maximum daily rainfall were observed in January at individual stations and across the region, especially since the early 1980s. Moreover, the annual frequency of extreme rainfall events consistently increased over the same period. The impacts on the unstable coastal main sandbar that protects the flood plain are discussed, while the effects on rice production are analyzed. The coping responses of the cultural rice and sugar palm-based agroforestry system, and the lack of adaptation of recent land-use changes are examined. The agro-ecological, economic, and social importance of the dense hedges of sugar palms to mitigate climatic risks and maintain the resilience of local livelihood systems is underlined. Propositions for short and longer-term measures to adapt water management, diversify cropping systems, and foster participatory disaster risk management are made.

Actions supporting one goal may influence progress in other goals, either positively (synergies) or negatively (trade-offs). Effective managing the synergies and trade-offs is a prerequisite for ensuring policy coherence. This is particular relevant at the river basin scale where the implementation of national policies may generate inequalities at the sub-basin levels, such as the upstream and the downstream. In the existing literature, there is still a lack of methodologies to assess the SDG interlinkages and their differences at the subnational levels. This paper presents a methodology on the development of an SDG interlinkages analysis model at the basin scale and its application to a case study in China's Luanhe River Basin (LRB). Seven broad areas, namely land use and land cover change, climate change, ecosystem services, flood risks, water sector, urbanisation, and energy, were set as the scope of study. Through a systematic review, key elements of the SDG interlinkages system were identified and their interactions were mapped. The resulting generic SDG interlinkages model were validated with expert survey and stakeholders' consultation and tailored to the LRB. Quantification of the SDG interlinkages was conducted for 27 counties in the LRB and demonstrated by the results of 3 selected counties located in the upstream, midstream and downstream areas, respectively. The methodology and its applications can be used to support integrated water resource management in river basins.

The Uttarakhand Himalaya is hydrologically very significant and a more comprehensive understanding of its response to climate change is needed. This paper analyses of elevation-dependent distribution and trends in snow-covered area (SCA), precipitation and temperature for the period 2000-2020 employing MODIS-Terra data, together with reanalysis (CHIRPS) and Landsat-8 data products within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The study reveals a significant increasing trend in annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation (except November) at different elevations, while SCA and temperatures exhibited more variable trends during the period. Digital elevation and spectral reflectance models reveal the effects of topography and surface attributes on snow cover. Statistical analyses reveal a significant relationship between precipitation and SCA (R2 = 0.78), while seasonal changes in temperature are apparent in an emerging pattern of warmer winters and a cooler pre-monsoon. SCA trends vary markedly between elevation zones in response to precipitation and temperature fluctuations. At higher altitudes, SCA decreased from 2000 to 2020 since, although precipitation increased slightly, marginally higher temperatures led to more snowmelt. Reduced snow cover and increased temperature are also associated with a decline in downstream fluvial during the period for which such data are available (2000 to 2005). The analysis of snow cover dynamics across different elevations improves our understanding of the overall hydrological conditions in the region and enable more reliable flood forecasting and management of water resources.

Future behavior of wind wave extremes due to climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GOODNESS-OF-FIT; BIAS CORRECTION; PROJECTED CHANGES; OCEAN WAVES; 21ST-CENTURY; ENSEMBLE; HEIGHT; PRECIPITATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; PROBABILITY	Extreme waves will undergo changes in the future when exposed to different climate change scenarios. These changes are evaluated through the analysis of significant wave height (H-s) return values and are also compared with annual mean H-s projections. Hourly time series are analyzed through a seven-member ensemble of wave climate simulations and changes are estimated in H-s for return periods from 5 to 100 years by the end of the century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Despite the underlying uncertainty that characterizes extremes, we obtain robust changes in extreme H-s over more than approximately 25% of the ocean surface. The results obtained conclude that increases cover wider areas and are larger in magnitude than decreases for higher return periods. The Southern Ocean is the region where the most robust increase in extreme H-s is projected, showing local increases of over 2 m regardless the analyzed return period under RCP8.5 scenario. On the contrary, the tropical north Pacific shows the most robust decrease in extreme H-s, with local decreases of over 1.5 m. Relevant divergences are found in several ocean regions between the projected behavior of mean and extreme wave conditions. For example, an increase in H-s return values and a decrease in annual mean H-s is found in the SE Indian, NW Atlantic and NE Pacific. Therefore, an extrapolation of the expected change in mean wave conditions to extremes in regions presenting such divergences should be adopted with caution, since it may lead to misinterpretation when used for the design of marine structures or in the evaluation of coastal flooding and erosion.

Ruby			Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Propagation of Summer Extreme Precipitation Events Over United States: A Complex Network Analysis	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LOW-LEVEL JET; MOISTURE TRANSPORT; SOIL-MOISTURE; WARM-SEASON; RAINFALL; CLIMATOLOGY; VARIABILITY	Complex network (CN) is a graph theory-based depiction of relation shared by various elements of a complex dynamical system such as the atmosphere. Here we apply the concept of CN to understand the directionality and topological structure of summer extreme precipitation events (SEPEs) over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The SEPEs are calculated based on the 95th percentile daily rainfall at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution for CONUS to investigate the multidimensional characteristics of precipitation extremes. The derived CN coefficients (e.g., betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, orientation, and network divergence) reveal important structural and dynamical information about the topology of the SEPEs and improve understanding of the dominant meteorological patterns. The initiation and propagation of SEPEs from the source zones to the sink zones are identified. The SEPEs are influenced by topography, dominant wind patterns, and moisture sources in terms of their topological structure and spatial dynamics. Plain Language Summary Every year, the United States incurs a loss of $3-$4 billion from flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Under climate change, extreme rainfall events are likely to intensify further in the future as the atmosphere can hold more moisture with warmer temperatures. However, very few studies have explored the inherent topological structure characterizing extreme precipitation. Understanding of this structure and its driving meteorological conditions holds a key to understanding the response of extreme precipitation systems to climate change. In this study, key influencing factors such as topography, dominant wind pattern, and soil moisture controlling the topology of the summer extreme precipitation events in the United States are identified using complex network analysis along with the regions predominantly acting as moisture source or sink.

Understanding the hydrological processes of floodplain wetlands is fundamental to study the changes in wetlands caused by climate change and human activities. In this study, floodplain wetlands along the middle reach of the Yellow River were selected as a study area. The hydrological processes and the interactions between the river and the underlying aquifer were investigated by combining remote sensing, hydraulic monitoring, and numerical modeling. Wetland areas from 2014 to 2019 were extracted from Landsat 8 remote sensing images, and their correlation with the river runoff was analyzed. The results indicate that the river flow had a limited impact on the wetland size and so did groundwater levels, due to the strong reliance of wetland vegetation on water levels. Based on hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, a surface water-groundwater coupled numerical model was established. The comparison and correlation analysis between the monitored groundwater head and the simulated river stage also show that river flow did not play a first-order role in controlling the groundwater levels of wetlands in the study area. The simulation results also suggest that it is the regional groundwater flow that mainly sustains shallow groundwater of floodplain wetlands in the study area. The floodplain wetland of the study area was dynamic zones between the regional groundwater and river, the contrasting pattern of hydrological regimes on both banks of the Yellow River was due to a combination of regional groundwater flow and topography.

In multipurpose water systems, stakeholders can face higher financial risks as a consequence of the higher costs or lower revenues arising from increased hydrological variability and recurrent extreme events. In this context, financial risk hedging tools able to bundle together the uncorrelated risks of wet and dry periods faced by different stakeholders may be an improved solution to both foster cooperation and manage the financial losses associated with extreme events. In this work, we explore the potential of risk diversification strategies, involving an index insurance contract solution, to simultaneously manage financial risk in a multipurpose water system prone to both drought and flood risk. Risk diversification can allow for reduced insurance premiums in situations in which the bundled risks are uncorrelated. Using an integrated operational and financial model, we characterize the financial risk associated with the water management policies and design a risk management strategy that bundles together the uncorrelated risk of drought and flood events. The approach is demonstrated using a case study on Lake Maggiore, a subalpine transboundary regulated lake whose management is controversial due to numerous and competing human activities. In particular, we focus on the ongoing conflict among the lake shore population, affected by flood risk, and the downstream farmers' districts, facing drought related losses. Results indicate that bundling uncorrelated risks from competing users is beneficial to both promoting insurance premium affordability and facilitating collaboration schemes at the catchment scale.

Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable environmental development, and food security.

Effects of 21st century climate change on seasonal flow regimes and hydrologic extremes over the Midwest and Great Lakes region of the US	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrologic extremes; Midwest and Great Lakes; Flooding; Low flows; Extreme low soil moisture	GLOBAL WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE IMPACTS; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; VIC-2L MODEL; PRECIPITATION; FLOODS; RISK; ADAPTATION; MULTIMODEL; STREAMFLOW	Analyzing future changes in hydrologic extremes such as floods, low flows, and soil moisture extremes is important because many impacts on ecosystems and human systems occur during extreme events. To quantify changes in hydrologic extremes, this study conducts hydrologic modeling experiments over 20 Midwestern watersheds using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced by historical observed datasets and future projections from statistically downscaled Global Climate Model (GCMs) simulations. Our results show that peak daily streamflow at the 100-yr reoccurrence interval will increase ( +10-30%) in most watersheds by 2080s due to significant increases in precipitation (P) and increasing P as rainfall during winter and spring seasons. The simulations also show strong shifts towards earlier peak flow timing (up to a month), especially in strongly snowmelt-dominated watersheds. These effects are linked to strong decreasing trends in maximum Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) with warming, which are simulated over essentially the entire domain. Projected changes in 7-day extreme low flows are smaller in magnitude ( - 10-+10%) with some what larger decreases simulated at the end of century; however, the timing of extreme low flows is projected to shift from winter/spring to summer and fall in strongly snowmelt-dominated watersheds in the northernmost parts of the domain. Extreme low soil moisture increases over most of the domain in the future projections up to the 2050s, but by the 2080s there are more widespread decreases in extreme low soil moisture, especially in the northernmost parts of the domain.

To account for these trends, hydrologists search for the best planning and management measures in an increasingly complex and uncertain environment. The collection of manuscripts in this Special Issue quantifies the changes in projected hydroclimatic extremes and their impacts using a suite of innovative approaches applied to regions in North America, Asia, and Europe.

Disentangling the Sources of Uncertainties in the Projection of Flood Risk Across the Central United States (Iowa)	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						hydrology; uncertainty; projections	EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; LARGE ENSEMBLES; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY	We explore the projected changes in flood impacts across Iowa (central United States) and the associated uncertainties by forcing a hydrologic model with downscaled global climate model outputs and four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Our results point to projected increasing magnitude and variability in flooding across the state, especially for high-emission scenarios. Next, we partition the flood impacts' projections into: (a) the response of the global climate models to anthropogenic forcing, (b) scenario uncertainty due to emissions, and (c) internal climate variability. We find scenario uncertainty plays a small role, while climate model uncertainty and internal climate variability dominate the flood impacts' projections, with the contribution of model uncertainty increasing toward the end of this century. Insights from our work can be utilized by stakeholders to understand the current limitations of flood impact projections and provide suggestions about where modelers should focus efforts to reduce uncertainty. This study looks at how climate change is projected to affect floods in Iowa (central United States). The results suggest that flooding is projected to worsen and become more unpredictable, especially with higher greenhouse gas emissions. The main sources of uncertainty in these projections are the differences in climate models' response to forcings and natural climate variability. Understanding these uncertainties can help improve future climate change assessments for flood risk stakeholders such as agencies working toward climate adaptation and water management and improve related risk assessments and planning analysis. Climate models producing larger increases in flood peak magnitude typically produce larger changes in varianceClimate model uncertainty is dominant in the early 21st century, while internal climate variability dominates the later part of the 21st centuryUncertainty in flood peaks directly translates to flood risk across Iowa	[Michalek, Alexander T.; Villarini, Gabriele; Kim, Taereem] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Villarini, Gabriele; Kim, Taereem] Princeton Univ, High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ USA; [Quintero, Felipe; Krajewski, Witold F.] Univ Iowa, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA	Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Iowa	Michalek, AT (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.	atmichalek@princeton.edu	Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016	Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370; Krajewski, Witold/0000-0002-3477-9281; Michalek, Alexander/0000-0002-0123-0428	Iowa Department of Transportation; Iowa Flood Center, IIHR-Hydroscience Engineering; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Institute for Water Resources;  [20-SPR2-002]	Iowa Department of Transportation; Iowa Flood Center, IIHR-Hydroscience Engineering; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Institute for Water Resources; 	This work was supported in part by the Iowa Department of Transportation (Project 20-SPR2-002).

Understanding the public's perception of risk has become an essential component of contemporary flood risk management, as it provides a basis for designing practical and effective flood mitigation strategies. This study was conducted in Anlo Beach, one of the most vulnerable coastal communities in Ghana. It investigated household perceptions of flood risk and examined them against independent physical measures that assess exposure. In parallel, multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify and establish the key factors influencing household perceptions of flood risk in the study area. The results showed that two variables, previous flood experience (data collected through the social survey) and factual exposure (assessed through GIS measurements), played an important role in determining the level of flood risk reported by households. In particular, the relationship between previous flooding experience and perceived level of coastal flood risk was both positive and statistically significant. Socio-demographic factors did not have a significant influence on risk reporting. We conclude that perception variables collected through social surveys can be used as proxy indicators of environmental risks when physical measures are not available. Biases based on the socio-economic status of respondents may exist, but they do not outweigh information derived from people's factual relationships with the environment. Further studies on the above factors would support flood risk reduction measures in the study area and West Africa, particularly in light of climate change.

The extensive riparian zones could mitigate climate change by absorbing floods and by retaining water during droughts. Human impacts largely reduced active river corridors through altered discharge and construction of dykes, while recent restoration projects aim at increasing river dynamics. The causes and consequences of Alpine river degradation are well understood, but there are only few quantitative studies on floodplain degradation and restoration. Thus, we have reconstructed historical changes of gravel bars along five Alpine rivers (Iller, Inn, Isar, Lech, and Wertach) in Southern Germany in the period 1808-2009, based on historical maps and aerial images. We found losses of >90% in gravel bar area along these rivers since the mid-19th century. The decline was caused by a reduction of the active river corridor and by ongoing succession of the remaining open habitats. Within the past 30 years, at the Isar River, restoration measures were realized with the aim to widen the active river corridor and to recreate gravel bars. In four restored reaches, we found that 5% of the historical gravel bar area recovered, and that the proportion of restored gravel bar area was highest after intermediate flooding. We conclude that the active river corridors of German Alpine rivers are almost completely lost, and that more extensive restoration needs to be done to preserve the habitat dynamics and biodiversity of these systems, and to adapt Alpine rivers to climate change.

However, the relevant terminology is not always properly established, especially when imported from other languages. This paper analyzes terms related to disasters caused by natural hazards from their early to current uses and applications. Additionally, a regional level analysis of disaster-related definitions was performed for Brazil. Based on this analysis, we suggest holistic definitions and approaches for the use of terms and their relationships. While the relevant terms have constantly evolved, it is noted that conflicts in their use-in either scientific, technical, or political environments-can result in contradictory usage, as exemplified by some Brazilian studies. The number of publications on this topic has grown since the 2000s due to technological diffusion and the increasing prevalence of climate change studies, which have contributed to a considerable increase in the use of terms such as capacity, resilience, and adaptation. Notably, the USA, Canada, and Europe are the main references for these terms. In other countries, few works have been dedicated to defining these terms, which has contributed to more damaging disasters. Providing adequate definitions for the disaster field is a complex task due to the variety of scientific areas involved. However, if the relationships between terms are well established, it is possible to adequately quantify the risk and improve disaster risk reduction. Developing countries can benefit greatly from this process since this can help them better apply their minimal resources with an emphasis on prevention and mitigation.

Empirical evidence from rural communities in Pakistan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Disaster risk reduction; Extreme events; Flood impacts; Rural-urban dependencies; Regional development; Vulnerability dynamics; Punjab	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK PERCEPTIONS; PUNJAB PROVINCE; ADAPTATION; MIGRATION; VULNERABILITY; LIVELIHOODS; RESILIENCE; PROXIMITY; TEMPORARY	Extreme flood events can lead to dramatic changes in societal processes, disrupt rural-urban linkages and affect rural vulnerabilities. Changes in rural-urban linkages due to extreme flooding have been theoretically discussed with limited empirical evidence. Therefore, this study investigates the impacts of a flood event on linkages between rural and urban areas of Pakistan. This study also examines socioeconomic and spatial factors that can influence changes in rural-urban linkages. Three case studies were selected from the Punjab province of Pakistan, and a total of 325 samples were collected through household surveys. Descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression and correlation analysis were conducted to analyse the data. The findings show that flooding has severely affected rural communities directly and indirectly. This paper details the many different ways in which floods can change rural linkages with cities-i.e., the flow of people, information, finance, goods and services between rural and urban areas. The results also reveal that the age of household head, education, income and farming occupation are influential factors that affect how rural-urban linkages change. Most importantly, the research highlights that extreme flooding can both increase and decrease the dependence of rural communities on cities in different ways. This indicates that linkages between rural and urban areas need to be strengthened in order to reduce flood-related vulnerabilities. This study paves the way for regional planners and disaster managers to establish synergies for developing integrated flood risk management and development strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Our review identified 33 publications that provide global or near-global estimates of population exposure to SLR and associated hazards. They fall into three main categories of exposure, based on definitions in the publications: (i) the population impacted by specified levels of SLR; (ii) the number of people living in floodplains that are subject to coastal flood events with a specific return period; and (iii) the population living in low-elevation coastal zones. Twenty of these 33 publications discuss connections between population migration and SLR. In our analysis of the exposure and migration data, we consider datasets, analytical methods, and the challenges of estimating exposure to SLR followed by potential human migration. We underscore the complex connections among SLR, exposure to its impacts, and migration. Human mobility to and from coastal areas is shaped by diverse socioeconomic, demographic, institutional, and political factors; there may be 'trapped' populations as well as those who prefer not to move for social, cultural, and political reasons; and migration can be delayed or forestalled through other adaptive measures. While global estimates of exposed and potentially migrating populations highlight the significant threats of SLR for populations living in low-lying areas at or near coastlines, further research is needed to understand the interactions among localised SLR and related hazards, social and political contexts, adaptation possibilities, and potential migration and (im)mobility decision-making.

Effect of Extreme Weather Events on Mental Health: A Narrative Synthesis and Meta-Analysis for the UK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						anxiety; depression; flooding; heat wave; post-traumatic stress disorder; systematic review	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; PLACE; VULNERABILITY; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; ENGLAND; ISSUES	Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity as a consequence of climate change and pose a significant threat to population mental health. This is the case even in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom (UK) where flooding and heat waves are forecast to become more common. We conducted a systematic review to quantify the prevalence and describe the causes of common mental health problems in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK. We searched Web of Science, EMBASE and PsycINFO for studies that measured the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK, published up to 12 December 2019. We included 17 studies, four of which were included in meta-analyses to determine the point prevalence of common mental health problems in the period within 12 months following extreme weather events. The point prevalence was 19.8% for anxiety (k = 4; n = 1458; 95% CI 7.42 to 32.15), 21.35% for depression (k = 4; n = 1458; 95% CI 9.04 to 33.65) and 30.36% for PTSD (k = 4; n = 1359; 95% CI 11.68 to 49.05). Key factors that affected mental ill health in people exposed to flooding were water depth and absence of flood warnings. Displacement from home underscored the narratives associated with people's perceptions of the impact of flooding. The high prevalence of common mental health problems suggests that the prevention of mental ill health in populations at risk or exposed to extreme weather events should be a UK public health priority.

Stanca-Costesti reservoir is one of the most important in Romania and one of the most affected by the hydrologic variability. The studies regarding the trophic state of this reservoir are few, even if there are some environmental issues in its hydrological basin that could be further investigated. According to the National Administration "Apele Romane" (ANAR) yearly reports, the Stanca-Costesti reservoir is, from the trophic state point of view, an oligotrophic lake. The current research is based on chemical and some biological data collected over 10 years (ANAR) for the trophic state of the Stanca-Costesti reservoir, using the Carlson index. The research investigates the hydrological data and spans over 10 years that were classified into three categories, namely: wet year, normal year, and dry year and the influences generated by the contrasting weather (flow and temperature changes) on the trophic state of the lake. The research findings show that the trophic state of the lake is directly influenced by the hydrological variability, namely evolving to a hypertrophic status due to concentrations of nutrients. Moreover, over the years, according to ANAR data, the water quality in the reservoir alternated. Hence, at times, the quality of the water was poor, with possible negative influences on water usage. As a consequence, we proposed that the water quality be verified monthly, and this should be done by means of a more reliable method, such as a multiparameter index or multicriteria analysis.

Green building programs such as LEED incorporate design strategies that, if applied proactively, could enhance community resilience and public health by reducing the adverse effects of climatic events, particularly in vulnerable neighborhoods. Methods: This exploratory spatial and ecological analysis assessed the spatial correlation between protective green building strategies and neighborhood-level vulnerability to two climatic events - extreme heat and flooding - in Austin, TX, and Chicago, IL, from 2001 to 2012. Results: In both locations, the frequency analysis found far fewer occurrences of LEED certified projects in neighborhoods with high densities of vulnerable populations. The hot spot and spatial autocorrelation analyses found no spatial correlation between clusters of protective green building strategies and clusters of vulnerable populations. Conclusions: Green building projects were not used in Austin or Chicago from 2001 to 2012 as a tool to reduce neighborhood vulnerability to the health and environmental effects of two high-risk climatic events: extreme heat and flooding. However, green building design, construction, and operations and maintenance projects could use local vulnerability maps and spatial analysis techniques to support decisions prioritizing strategies that simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and protect building occupants from exposure to climatic events. Similarly, local policymakers could use spatial analysis to prioritize protective built environment policies in the neighborhoods where they would do the most good.

In this work an index of physical vulnerability to sea level rise and marine floods was designed and applied over the coast of the Ravenna Province (Italy), a low-lying coastal area historically known as being susceptible to coastal flooding and erosion. The index is intended to be at the same time scientifically sound and easy to apply, so it is composed of five relevant variables (elevation, dunes, artificial protection structures, shoreline change rates, and land cover) that were weighted by using a multi-criteria decision making approach, namely the analytical hierarchy process. The weightings were assigned by experts familiar with coastal processes in the area, and all with background in environmental science. This enabled a transparent approach on integrating established expert knowledge to assign the relative importance of the variables in defining vulnerability scores. The final vulnerability score for each segment along the investigated coast was calculated by applying the weighted sum of all variables. For verification purposes, the obtained vulnerability ranking was compared to existing coastal flood hazard maps developed by regional authorities in the framework of the EU Floods Directive (2007/60/EC), and to real inundation events generated by historical storms. The integration of this framework into geographical information systems resulted in informative maps, useful to a variety of end-users such as coastal managers and decision makers.

Rewilding in the Garden: are garden hybrid plants (cultivars) less resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their parent species? A case study with <i>Primula</i>	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Climate change; Drought; Green infrastructure; Landscape; Ornamental; Waterlogging	BIOLOGICAL FLORA; BRITISH-ISLES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; URBAN TREES; GREEN ROOFS; TOLERANCE; RESPONSES; SELECTION; BIODIVERSITY; MITIGATION	Urban green infrastructure, such as gardens, can mitigate some of the consequences of climate change, e.g. reducing flash-flooding or urban heat islands. Green infrastructure, however, may itself be vulnerable to a changing climate, and not all garden and landscape plant taxa will remain viable under weather scenarios predicted for the future. It has been suggested that cultivated forms of garden plants (hybrids and selected varieties) particularly, will be susceptible to enhanced stress associated with more frequent flooding, drought and rapid oscillations between these hydrological extremes; thus potentially limiting the range of taxa that can be used in gardens in the future. This research explored this concept by evaluating cultivated forms of the common garden plant - Primula, and testing whether these were less resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their progenitor species, Primula vulgaris. The results support this hypothesis and demonstrated that cultivated taxa were more susceptible to the hydrological stresses imposed than Primula vulgaris. Interestingly though, those cultivars that superficially resembled the parent species (Primula 'Cottage Cream') showed more stress tolerance than others with larger or more ornamental flowers, suggesting a 'gradient of susceptibility' within the hybrids. The notion that the most flamboyant cultivars are sacrificing stress tolerance for traits linked with aesthetics is discussed.

These effects will be intensified in urban agglomerations as the concentration of population and allied activities are more pronounced there compared to the inland regions. Indian coastal cities are no exception, and it is high time to delineate these hazard-prone regions and implement proper mitigation and adaptation strategies at city scale. This review article provides an assessment regarding quantification, management and climate change impacts of flood risks in Surat, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, which are the most populated coastal cities in India. The flood impacts considered in the existing or prevailing analyses are associated with adverse effects on population, land use of cities, transportation and economy caused by different types of riverine and urban flooding, though coastal flooding, tsunami and storm surge effects are less studied. Mumbai and Kolkata are relatively progressive in the assessment of flood risks and adaptation. The present article also suggests strategies to evaluate the relative progress in the assessment of past and future risks and adaptation. We also discuss the mitigation and adaptation strategies considering the historical importance of these cities. We propose that the strategies should be implemented considering public opinion and should be initialized at the grass root level. Though it is technically difficult to re-plan the city structures in the current scenario, it is possible to adapt to and mitigate the effects of natural hazards through suitable planning and management with the integrated cooperation and involvement of citizens and government as well.

Coevolution of Flood Dynamics and Economical Production in Tropical Wetlands: Insights From Bayesian Networks in Ayapel Wetland, Colombia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						socio-hydrology; wetlands; co-evolution; Bayesian Networks; conceptual model	SOCIO-HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; TARIM RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LONG-TERM; WATER; HUMANS; GROUNDWATER; SYSTEM; GEOMORPHOLOGY; VULNERABILITY	The coevolution approach in socio-hydrological systems (SHS) allows the analysis of the interactions between social and hydrological systems over time. SHS's characteristics such as non-linearity, causality, integration of spatiotemporal scales and feedbacks must be considered. However, in simulation processes, there are challenges in analyzing these characteristics while integrating quantitative and qualitative source variables. We propose a general causal network for study of coevolution in tropical wetlands, operationalized through Bayesian Networks for a case study in Ayapel Wetland, Colombia. We defined the flood pulse and economic production to analyze the co-evolution of tropical wetlands. We identified that the probability of having more than 146,998 individuals of livestock is 30% and of obtaining a fish production considered "high" by fishers is 44.2% for a period from 1995 to 2019. However, under permanent conditions, the probability of this livestock decreases to 18.7%, and "high" fishing increases to 87.5%. Under seasonal conditions, the probability of high livestock production increases to 42.8%, and fish production decreases to 3.85%. We demonstrated how the loss of functionality of the existing hydraulic technology in the study area modifies the production dynamics and how a maximum level of agricultural and livestock production is associated with an increase in forest and grassland cover. We consider that the application of the network strengthens adaptation strategies for climate change or The El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, the risk management plans and land use decision plans in the tropical wetlands.

J	Fekete, A; Nehren, U				Fekete, Alexander; Nehren, Udo			Assessment of social vulnerability to forest fire and hazardous facilities in Germany	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						GIS; Forest fire index; Vulnerability indicator; Military training ground; Emergency management; Disaster risk reduction	COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; BRANDENBURG; WILDFIRES; DYNAMICS; DISASTER; MODELS; FLOODS	In recent years, Germany has seen an increase in forest fires, and many fires have occurred in mil-itary training areas that are difficult to access for firefighting. While casualties are still low and mostly restricted to firefighting personnel, settlements are also increasingly threatened. Increas-ing impacts from extreme events due to climate change will likely increase the ignition and spread of fires. More people are being affected by fires, and in need of external help to evacuate and cope with the resulting damages and losses. Forest fires also threaten military training site, with additional risks created by the presence of ammunition depots. Despite this hazard scenario, Germany so far lacks an overview of the spatial occurrence of forest fires and the related risk. This study develops a spatial exposure and social vulnerability as-sessment of settlements to forest fires in Germany. The results reveal that social vulnerability is an important variable in determining which settlements are potentially exposed to fire. Areas ex-posed to fire risk are characterised by having a higher proportion of women, a higher-than -average age, a higher number of young people under 18 years, a higher number of persons over 65 years and foreigners than the national average. Furthermore, exposed communities are char-acterised by higher rates of unoccupied housing units and lower living space per dwelling, as well as living in areas with high population densities within forested areas. The results can help to im-prove emergency management and spatial planning to prevent the development of fire risk areas.

This largely overlooks species that occur preferentially in tree crowns. Considering the vertical distribution patterns of epiphytic mosses and lichens in alluvial hardwood forests, such surveys would be incomplete and their results would differ from whole-tree surveys. This would be particularly critical with respect to surveys of the overall species diversity of such forest stands, assessments of their worthiness for protection, and for bioindication (e.g., the influence of climate change). In the present study, performed in the largest protected complex of alluvial forests in central Germany, we examined 20 sample trees wind-thrown and broken in recent storm events. Here epiphyte communities were recorded section-wise from the trunk base to the outer tree crown. 75 % of the epiphytic lichens were confined to the crown and upper trunk parts, while 30 % of the bryophyte taxa were restricted to the tree crowns and another 30 % were found only on the lower trunk and the trunk base. For both lichens and bryophytes, species of conservation concern were observed only in the tree crowns, as were most indicator species for climate warming. Using Ellenberg indicator values, we also found significant differences in moisture and light conditions, substrate reaction, continentality, and nutrient supply across the different tree sections. Thus, whole-tree samplings for bryophytes and lichens, especially in alluvial hardwood forests, yield much more accurate and sophisticated results about epiphyte diversity and ecological conditions than conventional lower-trunk surveys.

Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ECCC surface network modernization resulted in a shift from manual to automated precipitation measurements. Although many advantages to automation are realized, such as enhanced capabilities for monitoring in remote locations and a higher frequency of observations at lower cost, the increased reliance on automated precipitation gauges has also resulted in additional challenges, especially with data quality and homogenization. The automated weighing precipitation gauges used in the ECCC operational network have an increased propensity for wind-induced undercatch of solid precipitation. One outcome of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE) was the development of transfer functions for the adjustment of high-frequency solid precipitation measurements made with gauge/wind shield configurations used in the ECCC surface network. Using the SPICE universal transfer function (UTF), hourly precipitation measurements from 397 ECCC automated climate stations were retroactively adjusted for wind undercatch. The data format, quality control, and adjustment procedures are described here. The hourly adjusted data set (2001-2019; version v2019UTF) is available via the ECCC data catalogue at (ECCC, 2021). A basic spatial impact assessment shows that the highest relative total precipitation adjustments occur in the Arctic, where solid precipitation has an overall higher annual occurrence ratio. The highest adjustments for solid precipitation are shared by the Arctic, Southern Prairies, and the coastal Maritimes, where stations tend to be more exposed and snowfall events occur at higher wind speeds.

One of the key features and drivers of extreme weather events has been global warming, with record temperatures recorded globally. The World Meteorological Organization indicated that the 2010-2020 decade was one of the warmest on record. Continued global warming triggers a chain of positive feedback with far-reaching adverse implications on the environment and socio-economic activities. The tourism industry fears that increased global warming would result in severe challenges for the sector. The challenges include species extinction, disruption of tourism aviation, and several tourism activities. Given the extent of climate variability and change, this study examines the impacts of rising temperatures on tourism operations at Phinda Private Game Reserve in South Africa. The study adopts a mixed-method approach that uses secondary, archival, and primary data collected through interviews and field observations to investigate the impacts. Data analysis was done using XLSTAT and Mann-Kendall Trend Analysis to analyse climate trends, while content and thematic analyses were used to analyse primary data findings. The study found that increasing temperature is challenging for tourists and tourism employees as it affects productivity, sleeping patterns, tourism operations, and infrastructure. High temperatures are a considerable threat to water availability and animal sightings, adversely affecting the game drive experience. Increased heatwaves resulted in bird mortality and hatching mortality for turtles; this is a significant conservation challenge. The study recommends that heat stress be treated as a health and safety issue to protect tourists and employees.

Paleohydrological context for recent floods and droughts in the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Fraser River Basin; paleohydrology; dendroclimatology; water resources; streamflow extremes	RING-BASED RECONSTRUCTION; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIME-SERIES; STREAMFLOW; TEMPERATURE; DENDROCLIMATOLOGY; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; DISCHARGE	The recent intensification of floods and droughts in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia has had profound cultural, ecological, and economic impacts that are expected to be exacerbated further by anthropogenic climate change. In part due to short instrumental runoff records, the long-term stationarity of hydroclimatic extremes in this major North American watershed remains poorly understood, highlighting the need to use high-resolution paleoenvironmental proxies to inform on past streamflow. Here we use a network of tree-ring proxy records to develop 11 subbasin-scale, complementary flood- and drought-season reconstructions, the first of their kind. The reconstructions explicitly target management-relevant flood and drought seasons within each basin, and are examined in tandem to provide an expanded assessment of extreme events across the FRB with immediate implications for water management. We find that past high flood-season flows have been of greater magnitude and occurred in more consecutive years than during the observational record alone. Early 20th century low flows in the drought season were especially severe in both duration and magnitude in some subbasins relative to recent dry periods. Our Fraser subbasin-scale reconstructions provide long-term benchmarks for the natural flood and drought variability prior to anthropogenic forcing. These reconstructions demonstrate that the instrumental streamflow records upon which current management is based likely underestimate the full natural magnitude, duration, and frequency of extreme seasonal flows in the FRB, as well as the potential severity of future anthropogenically forced events.

Unlike intermittent and ephemeral rivers, they are disconnected from groundwater and do not support aquatic life. DR have often been undervalued by some scientific and social groups in terms of nature's contributions to people (NCP) because of the lack of an integrative perspective to encompass them and their high aridity and low flow. This study aims to provide the state of the art on DR in terms of geographic distribution, NCP, human well-being and drivers of change, and to identify knowledge gaps and the tools to bridge them. To this end, a systematic review of 79 scientific documents (26 case studies, 53 evidence-based works) published between 1995 and 2019 was conducted. Firstly, we analysed the main research trends using publication rates and bibliometric techniques. Secondly, we analysed DR distribution, NCP and drivers of change using mapping techniques, descriptive statistics and bibliographic analysis respectively. We especially identified regulating NCP but to a lesser extent, also material and non-material NCP affected by land use change, climate change, overexploitation, and demographic, political and economic changes. We found relevant gaps on NCP and how they affect the different components of well-being, and the effect of indirect drivers of change on them. Geographical information systems, international scientific collaboration, and basin and transdisciplinary approaches, could accelerate bridging gaps while new research, rehabilitation, management and conservation, and socio-economic opportunities are developed in parallel.

Ecological Interfaces between Land and Flowing Water: Themes and Trends in Riparian Research and Management	WETLANDS			English	Review						Bottomland; Floodplains; Human impacts; Rivers; Salicaceae; Tamarix; Vegetation	COTTONWOOD SEEDLING RECRUITMENT; RIVER FLOODPLAIN; MISSOURI RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; WESTERN PRAIRIES; LIFE-HISTORY; VEGETATION; RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEMS	This paper provides an overview of past, present and future themes for research and management of riparian zones, often relating to papers within this Wetlands Special Feature. Riparian research expanded in the United States around 1980 with themes that recognized (1) damage from excessive livestock, or (2) damage from river damming and diversion, and (3) the beneficial capacity of riparian buffers to intercept and assimilate nutrients and other water contaminants. Research expanded globally in the 1990s, with themes including (4) plant life history requirements and (5) reliance on fluvial geomorphic dynamics that enable riparian rejuvenation. Resource managers recognized that riparian areas provide (6) rich wildlife habitats (7) along with valued ecosystem services, (8) which encouraged conservation and restoration initiatives, (9) including environmental flow regimes. Floodplains are (10) vulnerable to invasive plants and management has included biocontrol such as for Tamarix in the American Southwest. Into the twenty-first century, (11) climate change is advancing, and riparian ecosystems may be especially impacted due to the compound challenges from increasing water demand and declining summer flows. As an emerging opportunity, (12) while reservoirs submerge floodplain vegetation, reservoir deltas may support compensatory riparian wetlands. (13) Studies increasingly utilize remote sensing tools including satellite imagery, LiDAR and unmanned aircraft systems, and (14) the coordination of large data sets invites digital ecology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. Since riparian zones are centres for human activities, (15) there are opportunities for citizen science, social media and internet applications, which will increasingly democratize riparian research and management.

J	Babcicky, P; Seebauer, S				Babcicky, Philipp; Seebauer, Sebastian			Unpacking Protection Motivation Theory: evidence for a separate protective and non-protective route in private flood mitigation behavior	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Flood risk management; risk research; climate change adaptation; risk perception; coping beliefs; household flood preparedness	RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREPAREDNESS; ADAPTATION; PREDICTORS; HOUSEHOLDS; HAZARDS; APPEALS; PEOPLE; THREAT	Flood preparedness of private households is regarded an essential building block of integrated flood risk management. In the past decade, numerous empirical studies have employed the protection motivation theory (PMT) to explain flood mitigation behavior at the household level. However, much of this research has produced mixed results and could not consistently confirm the strength and direction of the relationships between the PMT components. Based on a survey of 2,007 households in flood-prone areas, this study revisits the model structure of the PMT by means of structural equation modeling. Compared to the methods used in previous studies, this modeling technique allows us to capture the PMT components in greater detail and to comprehensively test their hypothesized interrelations. Our results point to two separate routes leading to two different response types: A protective route from coping appraisal to protective behavior, and a non-protective route from threat appraisal to non-protective responses. Risk perception is not found to be part of the protective route, neither are non-protective responses confirmed to undermine protection motivation. The two separate routes are observed consistently across all combinations of the six protective and four non-protective responses assessed in this study. In the light of encouraging private flood adaptation, risk communication measures should specifically target the protective route and avoid (accidentally) providing incentives that fall within the non-protective route. This cross-sectional study, however, cannot establish how the two routes interrelate over time. More experimental and longitudinal research is required to address potential feedback effects and the role of decision stages.

Expert views on strategies to increase water resilience: evidence from a global survey	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						drought; flood; water resilience; water resource management; water security; watershed governance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; ANTHROPOCENE; PANACEAS; SYSTEM; POLICY	Scholars and policy-makers are advocating for increasing the resilience of water systems, both social and biophysical, to climate change impacts, and global environmental change more broadly. But what is "water resilience," and what does it imply for water resources management and water governance? Generally, water resilience may include ecological aspects of water quality or flood mitigation, engineered infrastructure to ensure safe and reliable water supply and to mitigate floods, and the socially inclusive and equitable governance of these systems. Following this, our goal was twofold: (1) explore and draw out a comprehensive set of water resource management strategies across sectors that are likely to contribute to increased resilience, and (2) investigate whether disciplinary divides are indeed a barrier toward convergence around key water resilience actions. To address these two gaps, we drew on a survey of experts in resilience and various aspects of water management and governance (n = 420), and aimed to synthesize their views on the specific strategies that can help enhance water resilience. Specifically, we surveyed experts across various water domains from ecosystem management to drought and flood management. Overall, we found that while debates about how to theorize or operationalize resilience in relation to different systems social or biophysical may be unresolved, there is considerable convergence among various experts about which actions are likely to make water systems more resilient to increasing risks and uncertainties. The most widely agreed upon strategies for building water resilience revolve around improved ecosystem health, integration across scales, and adaptation to change.	[Rodina, Lucy; Chan, Kai M.

Due to climate change and changes in leisure and tourism behaviour, swift water rescue operations are becoming increasingly important. Operations are carried out by swimming, using rope techniques or with the help of rafts. Possible operations include all areas with strongly flowing waters where patients cannot be reached by conventional means. Unit deployments also occur at locations during floods or heavy rain events. In these cases, patient care can rarely be provided by means of conventional rescue services. Incorporating elements of tactical medicine can be useful.

We use yearly panel data from 1990 to 2017 for the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries to examine such a relationship. To have an impartial analysis, we control major variables influencing environmental policies such as energy consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), population, technology, head of the state's political affiliation, carbon emission, and waste generation. The analysis results suggest that policymakers make more stringent environmental decisions as the death rate increases and environmental threats become more imminent putting human life is at risk; this correlation is stronger in the case of European Countries.

The rapid mapping and assessment of flood disasters pose urgent challenges for developing countries with poor data facilities or databases. In this study, the characteristics of the 2022 mega-flood in Pakistan were monitored and analyzed based on multi-resources data. The extent of inundation throughout Pakistan and its impact on farmlands, buildings, and roads were mapped using Synthetic Aperture Radar remote sensing data processing technology. The results showed that a 10-m resolution flooding map could be achieved using the Google Earth Engine platform in a timely manner with reasonable precision. A GIS-based bluespot model was used to evaluate the risk of dam-failure floods. The zone risk distribution map of the dam-failure flood was produced with five risk levels, which contribute to the safety of the key infrastructure for flooding control. The potential influencing factors of snow melting in northern Pakistan induced by heat waves and disasters was detected using Earth observations and long-record historical data. The study provides data-driven approach options for monitoring flood hazards over large areas in emergency using multi-available data sources, where in situ monitoring is difficult. This study not only provided direct data products and risk maps for mega-flooding control in Pakistan, but also proposed five aspects of flood prevention and control recommendations for this region and its neighborhood areas to cope with flood disasters effectively under worsening climate change conditions.

J	Li, YB; Teng, R; Iqbal, M				Li, Yabo; Teng, Rui; Iqbal, Mubasher			Natural resources rent and climate vulnerability: An inverted U-shaped relationship moderated by productive capacity, trade openness, and urbanization in resource-abundant countries	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Natural resources; Productive capacity; Environmental sustainability	GROWTH; TESTS	Natural resources play a pivotal role in the global economy, with numerous nations leveraging their extraction, utilization, and exportation as primary drivers for economic advancement. Nonetheless, an overreliance on these resources can expose countries to the adverse effects of climate change, including droughts, floods, and other extreme climatic events, thereby jeopardizing production and revenue streams. Paradoxically, the revenues derived from natural resource extraction can be channeled towards initiatives aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation, underscoring the intricate interplay between natural resources and climate vulnerability. This research endeavors to elucidate the inverted U-shaped relationship between total natural resources rent and climate vulnerability. The study encompasses nineteen resource-rich countries over the period 2000-2021. Employing the panel quantile ARDL (Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag) methodology with a dynamic fixed effect specification, we delve into the moderating influence of overall productive capacity, trade openness and urbanization on the nexus between resource extraction and climate vulnerability. The panel QARDL estimations are segmented into the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles for both long-term and short-term outcomes. In the long-term perspective, our findings validate an inverted U-shaped association between total natural resources rent and climate vulnerability. Factors such as urbanization and trade openness exhibit a positive correlation with climate vulnerability, whereas economic growth demonstrates an inverse relationship. Significantly, the study reveals that productive capacity, when acting as a moderator for natural resources rent, holds the potential to attenuate climate vulnerability.

These dynamics are closely linked to many wetland ecosystem services including flood buffering, nutrient retention and biodiversity support. Here, we investigate if and how current water storage dynamics can differ between wetlands within the same wetlandscape. Based on continuous monitoring of water levels in multiple wetlands throughout a growing season (spring, summer, autumn) in Vattholma, Sweden, we show that there are two distinct storage behaviours depending on the position of the wetland within the landscape. Headwater wetland regions were active in temporary storage of surplus water from regular summer rains while water levels of downstream wetlands dropped to seasonal low values without responding to individual summer precipitation events. Thereby, the downstream wetlands maintained capacity to buffer extreme floods. We also found that headwater wetlands were associated with complex and patchy inundation, which causes habitat conditions to vary over short time scales both within and among these wetlands, in contrast to the prolonged low-water state of the downstream wetlands. These differences between headwater-downstream wetlands imply that the functionality of an entire wetlandscape cannot be assessed by simple extrapolation of data from monitoring stations that typically are located downstream of headwater regions. Increased understanding of these differences can support wetland management practices that target location-specific nature-based solutions and ecosystem services.

Climate change projection in the design phase of urban planning allows building capacity for urban adaptation and avoids future economic costs. Many coastal communities still keep reactive adaptation responses due to a lack of knowledge about how to incorporate this information in planning. In this sense, this paper presents a modelling framework to guide the incorporation of climate projections in the planning and management of coastal areas. The framework was applied in a coastal city of Brazil, where high environmental vulnerability and constantly coastal flooding are observed. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the emission scenarios, in the short and medium-term, for precipitation projections and runoff peak flow. Extreme rainfall projections give differences up to 21% between the historical series and the projection for 2100. For the sea level projection, the extent of flooded areas induced by the worst emission scenario until the end of the century will reach 10% of the total municipally area (characterized by ecologically sensitive areas). In general, the framework provides preliminary information that can be used to improve spatial planning in a local context. Given the several simplified assumptions, the results should be used with caution, serving as a baseline for future planning efforts in the search for resilient cities.

The Beautiful and the Dammed: Defining Multi-Stressor Disturbance Regimes in an Atlantic River Floodplain Wetland	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						anthropogenic disturbance; multiple stressors; floodplain; wetlands; hydrological alteration; historical change	SAINT JOHN RIVER; NUTRIENT RETENTION; NEW-BRUNSWICK; R-PACKAGE; CONNECTIVITY; VEGETATION; SEDIMENT; WATER; DAMS; MORPHOLOGY	Natural hydrological fluctuations within river floodplains generate habitat diversity through variable connections between habitat patches and the main river channel. Human modification of floodplains can alter the magnitude and frequency of large floods and associated sediment movement by interrupting these floodplain connections. The lower Wolastoq | Saint John River and its associated floodplain wetlands are experiencing anthropogenic disturbances arising from climate change, increased urbanization in the watershed, changing upstream agricultural landscape practices, and, most notably, major road and dam construction. By comparing digitized aerial images, we identified key periods of change in wetland extent throughout an ecologically significant component of the floodplain, the Grand Lake Meadows and Portobello Creek wetland complex, with significant erosion evident in coves and backwater areas across the landscape following dam construction and significant accretion around the Jemseg River following highway construction. Connectivity and hydrological regime also influenced other habitat components, namely nutrients and metals retention, as well as the composition of the local macrophyte community. These findings address two key aspects of floodplain management: (1) understanding how hydrological alteration has historically influenced floodplain wetlands can inform us of how the ecosystem may respond under future conditions, such as climate change, and (2) the mechanisms by which habitat diversity and disturbance regimes filter biological communities, with the potential for patches to host a rich biodiversity continuously supporting critical ecosystem functions.

In this study, we present geochemical and pyrite morphological data from an Upper Permian-Lower Triassic shale succession in the Western Hubei Trough, northern South China. The stratigraphic evolutions of paleoclimate, paleoredox condition and paleosalinity are analysed. Our data support that regional tectonics, collision of the South China Craton and the North China Craton, may have played a major role in hydrographic and redox evolution of the Western Hubei Trough, suggesting anoxia may not be a worldwide cause of marine PTB biocrisis. On the other hand, an extensive comparison between marine and terrestrial successions supports that global warming in the Late Permian may have induced enhanced supply of freshwater to the ocean and the flooding of seawater across the boundary between marine and fresh to brackish waters due to sea-level rise, leading to dilution of seawater, while global cooling in the Permian-Triassic transition may have induced reduced supply of freshwater to the ocean, leading to increase of seawater paleosalinity. On the land, both global and regional climate changes may have controlled the freshwater supply to water bodies, leading to fluctuation of watermass paleosalinity. Our data support that anomalous changes of watermass paleosalinity triggered by paleoclimate changes may have played a role in the PTB biocrisis.

This study aims to establish the link between the willingness to carry out protective behaviors and physical and perceived indicators of vulnerability. A typology of coastal flooding vulnerability, uses various physical indicators and their perceived counterparts which have been collected from 490 inhabitants of Cartagena (Colombia, declared world heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 1984), resident in areas of coastal flooding risks. The item-response theory (IRT) approach has been used. The results reveal that the implementation of protective behaviors is more related to perceived indicators, such as distance to the sea, than to actual physical vulnerability. We observe that physical vulnerability is linked to the intention to carry out protective behaviors. The presence of a defensive structure against coastal flooding could be considered as a visual cue and be a good predictor of the willingness to carry out protective behaviors. On the contrary, people in the most vulnerable situation (single-storey house) do not demonstrate a higher level of willingness to carry out protective behavior, as well of participants who lived in residential buildings which have demonstrated lower level of willingness to carry out such behaviors. Therefore, vulnerability of the house is not seen as a criterion that encourages participants to better protect themselves.

In this study, a large database of 171 basins located in southern France with daily discharge data with a median record length of 45 years is considered to analyze flood trends and their drivers. In addition to discharge data, outputs of precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration from the SAFRAN reanalysis and soil moisture computed with the ISBA land surface model are also analyzed. The evolution of land cover in these basins is analyzed using the CORINE database. The trends in floods above the 95th and 99th percentiles are detected by the Mann-Kendall test and quantile regression techniques. The results show that despite the increase in extreme precipitation reported by previous studies, there is no general tendency towards more severe floods. Only for a few basins is the intensity of the most extreme floods showing significant upward trends. On the contrary, most trends are towards fewer annual flood occurrences above both the 95th and 99th percentiles for the majority of basins. The decrease in soil moisture seems to be an important driver for these trends, since in most basins increased temperature and evapotranspiration associated with a precipitation decrease are leading to a reduction in soil moisture. These results imply that the observed increase in the vulnerability to these flood events in recent decades is mostly caused by human factors such as increased urbanization and population growth rather than climatic factors.

Stakeholders involved with local level flood risk management (FRM) often overlook and underutilise this LK. There is thus an increasing need for its identification, documentation and assessment. Based on qualitative research, this paper critically explores the notion of LK in Malawi. Data was collected through 15 focus group discussions, 36 interviews and field observation, and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings indicate that local communities have a complex knowledge system that cuts across different stages of the FRM cycle and forms a component of community resilience. LK is not homogenous within a community, and is highly dependent on the social and political contexts. Access to LK is not equally available to everyone, conditioned by the access to resources and underlying causes of vulnerability that are outside communities' influence. There are also limits to LK; it is impacted by exogenous processes (e.g., environmental degradation, climate change) that are changing the nature of flooding at local levels, rendering LK, which is based on historical observations, less relevant. It is dynamic and informally triangulated with scientific knowledge brought about by development partners. This paper offers valuable insights for FRM stakeholders as to how to consider LK in their approaches.

Youth, women and the climate movement were credited with the record numbers elected of Greens Party and independent climate action candidates. These outcomes were supported by campaigners adopting a long-term, door knocking strategy of listening to people's concerns and volunteering assistance in the community after flooding on Australia's east coast. Despite these political gains, the climate movement must continue its activism if more ambitious and urgently required policy actions are to be enacted for climate mitigation and adaptation.

Assessment of climatic and anthropogenic effects on flood dynamics in the Cerknisko Polje (SW Slovenia) based on a 70-year observation dataset	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Karst; Flooding; Long-term dynamics; Construction activities; Climate change; Cerknisko Polje	KARST AREAS; IMPACTS	Study Region: Cerknisko Polje, (SW Slovenia) - regularly flooded polje with a complex recharge and partly disturbed due to human interventions. Study Focus: We focus on the long-term flooding dynamics on the polje, including analyses of trends over time, seasonal changes and identification of the impact of climate change and human construction activities on the flooding dynamics. For this purpose, we used a 70 years long dataset of continuous hydrological and meteorological measurements, and analysed documents about past human activities on the polje. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Comprehensive analyses have revealed notable changes in the flood dynamics over past decades which mostly reflect a general drop of the water level. This is linked to both changes in the climate (lower effective precipitation) and human construction activities (regulation of the river beds, construction of dams, widening or reclogging of swallow holes). In the 1970s floods were longer and more extensive due to experimental permanent lake formation but since the partial removal of constructions, floods have become shorter and less extensive, although extreme events are more frequent than in the past. These changing patterns further impact on biodiversity, which is one of the most remarkable elements of the polje.

J	Alberts, R; Marques, J				Alberts, Ronald; Marques Filho, Jose			The increase in streamflows and its impact on the probability of failure by sliding of the Santa Clara HPP dam using Monte Carlo method	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE			English	Article						Probability of failure; Stability of dams; Sliding stability; Climate change; Increase in river streamflows		Rainfall behavior has been affected worldwide, probably because of climate change. In several cases, this modification generated more intense river streamflows. Risk assessment is essential to check the security of existing dams, and it provides guidance for the design of future hydraulic structures. The risk analysis approach helps new projects to comply with safety criteria, or it is a reliable method to guide the need for safety interventions or repairs and to help in the decision to increase their discharge capacity. A case study of the Santa Clara Hydro-Power Plant was carried out to analyze if there were changes in the design flood and the impact that these variations could have on the dam failure probability. The maximum streamflows determined at the time of the dam construction were compared with the streamflows found in the update of the hydrological studies. Analyzing the results, it was possible to find out there was an increase in streamflow rates. The Monte Carlo method was used to establish a curve correlating the affluent streamflow with the probability of failure, allowing to verify the update of the hydrological study of the project implied an increase in the probability of failure of 18.1% for the millennial flood.

To face increasing coastal risks, various adaptation options are considered by atoll countries and territories, including in particular hard protection (preferred option to date), Nature-based Solutions (increasingly used) and island raising (considered a longer-term solution and a potential alternative to international migration, e.g. in the Maldives). Internal relocation within the same atoll island or atoll, which refers to long-term community movement from one threatened island area or island to a safer island area or island, has previously been disregarded by scholars as a potentially relevant climate adaptation strategy. However, in low-lying coastal areas, it offers real potential to address the dual context of increasing climate risks and the shrinking of the solution space. This paper assesses the potential of internal relocation for atolls by applying to Rangiroa Atoll, French Polynesia, Central Pacific, a two-fold assessment framework questioning its physical relevance (are some islands high enough to host settlements in the future?) and its societal feasibility (are the political-institutional and socio-economic conditions in place? Are people willing to relocate?). The findings show that internal relocation is both relevant and feasible on Rangiroa Atoll and should therefore serve as a pillar to develop robust in situ adaptation pathways in this atoll.

J	Nye, H; Condron, A				Nye, Henry; Condron, Alan			Assessing the statistical uniqueness of the Younger Dryas: a robust multivariate analysis	CLIMATE OF THE PAST			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL; GREENLAND; MELTWATER; RECORD; EVENT	During the last glacial period (ca. 120-11 kyr BP), dramatic temperature swings, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, are clearly manifest in highresolution oxygen isotope records from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Although variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is often invoked, a unified explanation for what caused these "sawtooth-shaped" climate patterns has yet to be accepted. Of particular interest is the most recent D-O-shaped climate pattern that occurred from similar to 14 600 to 11 500 years ago - the Bolling-Allerod (BA) warm interstadial and the subsequent Younger Dryas (YD) cold stadial. Unlike earlier D-O stadials, the YD is frequently considered a unique event, potentially resulting from a rerouting and/or flood of glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic or a meteorite impact. Yet, these mechanisms are less frequently considered as the cause of the earlier stadials. Using a robust multivariate outlier detection scheme - a novel approach for traditional paleoclimate research - we show that the pattern of climate change during the BA/YD is not statistically different from the other D-O events in the Greenland record and that it should not necessarily be considered unique when investigating the drivers of abrupt climate change. In so doing, our results present a novel statistical framework for paleoclimatic data analysis.

There is a need for community-based biomonitoring programs to observe and understand the effects of these stressors on the environment. Here we present results from a 5 year annual sampling program of benthic invertebrates from lakes in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, using a rapid bioassessment protocol. Connectivity between the deltaic lakes and main channels is a major driver of lake function and is expected to be substantially impacted by climate change. Lakes were selected along a gradient of connectivity based on sill elevation above the river. Using multivariate analyses of community structure, we determined that benthic assemblages responded to differences in connection time among lakes. This response was detected using a coarse taxonomic level that could be applied by community groups or volunteers but was stronger when invertebrates were identified to the family and genus levels. A secondary gradient was observed that corresponded to productivity gradients in lakes that are isolated from the river during summer. We show that benthic assemblages have potential use as sensitive indicators of climate-mediated changes to the hydrology of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta.

WATER			English	Article						highflow events; seasonality analysis; circular statistics; multimodal seasonality	STREAMFLOW TRENDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; US STREAMFLOW; FLOWS; PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; MAGNITUDE; SHIFTS; IMPACT	Climate change is likely to impact precipitation as well as snow accumulation and melt in the Northeastern and Upper Midwest United States, ultimately affecting the quantity and seasonal distribution of streamflow. The objective of this study is to analyze seasonality of long-term daily annual maximum streamflow (AMF) records and its changes for 158 sites in Northeastern and Upper Midwest Unites States. A comprehensive circular statistical approach comprising a kernel density method was used to assess the seasonality of AMF. Temporal changes were analyzed by separating the AMF records into two 30-year sub-periods (1951-1980 and 1981-2010). Results for temporal change in seasonality showed mixed pattern/trend across the stations. While for majority of stations, the distribution of AMF timing is strongly unimodal (concentrated around spring season) for the period 1951-1980, the seasonal modes have weakened during the period 1981-2010 for several stations along the coastal region with simultaneous emergence of multiple modes indicating changes of seasonality therein. The fresh statistical approach based on non-parametric circular density estimates reduces some of the limitations of previous studies to detect and model event timing distributions with multiple seasons and addresses issues of non-stationarity in the data records of extreme events.

Globally, there is growing demand to develop infrastructure to harvest water resources to support agriculture, threatening the ecological integrity of associated wetland ecosystems. We investigated the potential ecological impacts on floodplain wetland connectivity in northern Australia in response to changes in flow regime due to dam construction and climate change. Results for this study indicate that a drier climate and/or dam construction in catchments have the potential to reduce the effective size of the floodplain and reduce wetland connectivity. A drier climate will reduce rainfall and subsequent catchment run-off, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of riverine flows. In contrast, dams in the upper catchment will reduce the magnitude of flows downstream. The reduction in flows under both dam development and a drier climate will result in reduced extent and duration of floodplain inundation and decreased wetland connectivity. As a result, we anticipate that this loss of connectivity will reduce the capacity for nutrients, carbon and primary production to be flushed into the river channel, as well as reduce the ability for biota such as fish and turtles to move between in-channel and off-channel habitats.

The use of nature-based solutions (NbS), and more specifically ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction measures (Eco-DRR), has become a popular response for risk reduction that also provides highly-valued co-benefits. Public acceptance is of particular importance for NbS since they often rely on local collaborative implementation, management, and monitoring, as well as long-term protection against competing societal interests. Although public engagement is a common goal of NbS projects, it is rarely carried out with a sufficient understanding of the (de)motivating factors tied to public perceptions. Successful collaboration demands consideration of societal attitudes and values in relation to risk, nature, and place. However, existing research does not sufficiently explore these themes together, their interactions, and their implications for the public acceptance of NbS. This may lead to misaligned public expectations and failed participatory initiatives, while jeopardizing the success of NbS projects and their continued funding and uptake. We conducted citizen surveys within local NbS "host" communities to determine the degree of pro-NbS attitudes and behavior, associated variables, and how these may be leveraged to increase acceptance. We compared results across sites, relying primarily on correlations and regression models along with survey comments and expert knowledge. Three distinct rural NbS being implemented within the OPERANDUM project aim to reduce risk from (socio-)natural hazards in Scotland (landslides and coastal erosion; n = 66 respondents), Finland (eutrophication and algal blooms; n = 204) and Greece (river flooding and water scarcity; n = 84). Our research thus centers on rural NbS for risk reduction within a large EU project. Trust in implementers is a consistent factor for defining attitudes towards the NbS across the sites, and attitudes are strongly associated with respondents' commitment to nature and behavioral acceptance (i.e., willingness to engage). Behaviorial acceptance is most consistently predicted by connectedness to place and the extent of expected future impacts. Skepticism of NbS effectiveness leads to high public demand for relevant evidence. To increase public acceptance, we recommend greater framing of NbS in relation to place-based values as well as demonstration of the effectiveness of NbS for risk reduction. However, distinct hazard types, proposed NbS, and historical characteristics must be considered for developing strategies aimed at increasing acceptance. An understanding of these characteristics and their interactions leads to evidence-based recommendations for our study sites and for successful NbS deployment in Europe and beyond.

J	Wilgan, R				Wilgan, Robin			Occurence and ecological determinants of dual mycorrhizal symbiosis of forest tree species and its potential importance in changing climate	SYLWAN			Polish	Article						species competition; plant adaptations; microbial interactions; respond to drought; arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi	ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CARBON; COLONIZATION; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT	The distribution of trees depends on the climate, but mycorrhizal symbiosis shapes their distribution along the climatic gradient and the ability of trees to resistant the effects of climate change. Ectomycorrhiza is adapted to the cold climate so ectomycorrhizal trees predominate in boreal, mountain and temperate forests. Arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species are few in temperate forests but common in the dry and warm climate in tropical and subtropical zones. Some trees can enter dual mycorrhizal symbiosis, i.e. ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Both types of mycorrhizae benefit the plants, but each type is more adapted to the other environmental conditions. On the roots of dual mycorrhizal trees, the dominance of one mycorrhizal type over another is switching with the increasing value of environmental factors such as temperature of soil, moisture and nutrient availability. Thus dual mycorrhizal trees are more resistant to shift in habitat conditions including seasonal flooding and/or drought and inhabit ecosystems like floodplains, riparian forests and savanna. In general, dual mycorrhizal trees in compared with the single-type mycorrhizal trees are characterized by greater survival, growth, nutrient uptake and longitude range in both native and invasive range put together, so seems to be more resistant to climate changes. These adaptations are an asset for native trees, but on the other hand, the threat of alien tree species. The general proportion of plant species naturalized outside their native range is significantly higher for plants able to enter the dual mycorrhizal symbiosis than only one type. The similar patterns concerning the invasive tree species. Dual mycorrhizal tree species constitute about one-third of all the invasive tree species, but about twice as many among those, which are invasive in five or more of seven biogeographic regions of the world, including willow, poplar, eucalyptus and acacia species. Most of all, invasive tree species from subtropical and tropical zones, such as eucalyptus and black locust threaten European forests. These trees are well adapted to dry conditions so are less affected than European trees by drought, but their plantations caused the drop in groundwater level, intensify the effects of drought on native trees and reduce the efficiency of surrounding agricultural production. In the context of climate changes and the seasonal drought in Poland, expanding knowledge of interactions among microbial symbionts and tree species is necessary to a better assessment of the future benefits and risk involved in the use of each individual tree species.

Aware but not prepared: understanding situational awareness during the century flood in Germany in 2021	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Climate change impact; Evacuation; Machine learning; Pluvial floods; Social media; Topic modelling; Twitter; Warnings	SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; DISASTER; RISK; TEXT; EMERGENCIES; MANAGEMENT; EVENTS; PEOPLE; EUROPE	In July 2021, intense rainfall in parts of Western Europe was followed by unprecedented flash flooding. The flooding killed many people, mostly in Germany, which was subsequently blamed on a lack of preparation by either authorities or the broader populace. Knowledge about people's awareness of a hazard, its impacts and possible adaptation can help improve hazard management. We used social media data to assess situational awareness, sentiments and behaviour before, during and after the flood. We analysed nearly 58,000 German Twitter (now X) messages about the flood using machine learning-based unsupervised topic modelling. We showed that message frequency translated into four phases with message content suggesting sender priorities shifted in each phase of the flood. Besides messages with weather updates, correlated topics included 'Solidarity, recovery and aid' and 'Grief and empathy' (together 22% of all tweets) and a set of four topics about climate change attribution, extreme weather, long-term flood protection measures and politics (together 38% of all tweets). Many topics depended on the phase of the flood and on the distance from the affected areas. For those near the affected areas, tweets about evacuation (in peak phase) and damage assessment (in recovery phase) were particularly prominent. The high engagement on Twitter to seek weather information might indicate awareness of the extreme climatic conditions before the flood, but the severity was unexpected. Social media data provided unprecedent citizen-generated real-time information. We discuss how rapid automated analysis could contribute to disaster communication and risk mitigation.	[Zander, K.

Localized mega-nourishments are meant to alleviate erosion problems by diffusing alongshore over decades and thus feeding adjacent beaches. The 21-st century morphological evolution of the Delfland coast, where the Sand Engine mega-nourishment was built in 2011, was simulated with the Q2Dmorfo model to assess the Sand Engine capacity to protect the area against the effects of MSLR. The calibrated and validated model was forced with historical wave and sea-level data and MSLR projections until 2100 corresponding to different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results show that the Sand Engine diffusive trend will continue in forthcoming decades, with the feeding effect to adjacent beaches being less noticeable from 2050 onward. Superimposed to this alongshore diffusion, MSLR causes the shoreline to recede because of both passive-flooding and a net offshore sediment transport produced by wave reshaping and gravity. The existing feeding asymmetry enforces more sediment transport to the NE than to the SW, causing the former to remain stable whilst the SW shoreline retreats significantly, especially from 2050 onward. Sediment from the Sand Engine does not reach the beaches located more than 6 km to the SW, with a strong shoreline and profile recession in that area, as well as dune erosion. The uncertainties in the results are dominated by those related to the free model parameters up to 2050 whilst uncertainties in MSLR projections prevail from 2050 to 2100.

Interacting Effects of Watershed and Coastal Processes on the Evolution of Compound Flooding During Hurricane Irene	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						compound flooding; Hurricane surge; climate change; sea level rise; coastal hydrology; hydrological processes	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; RAINFALL; STATES; MODEL; DROUGHT; TRENDS; OCEAN	In low-lying estuarine regions, compound flooding (CF) is caused by the co-occurrence of extreme precipitation, river flooding and storm surge. In recent decades, there has been a rise in the frequency and intensity of pluvial-coastal CF events in different parts of the U.S. due to the increased frequency of intense precipitation and storm surge events. However, in estuarine and deltaic regions, the CF characteristics depend mainly on the storm tide and river flow interaction. Understanding how the fluvial-coastal CF may respond to changes to watershed and estuarine characteristics is essential for future CF hazard prediction. This study examined two critical processes: (a) the interplay between antecedent soil moisture conditions and peak river flow, and (b) how the impact of sea level rise (SLR) on storm surge and river flood distribution alters the CF in complex estuaries. As the study area, we selected the Delaware Bay and River, a shallow and convergent estuary in the US Mid-Atlantic region-where flood hazards during a CF can become more significant than the surge and river flood processes occurring in isolation. For the focal event for the study, we selected Hurricane Irene (2011) because it reportedly produced the most extreme CF over the past two decades in the same region. Ultimately, our results illustrated that the potential changes to the catchment and bay characteristics from the global temperature increase and SLR could significantly modulate the fluvial-coastal CF variability. The potential increase in global temperature and rainfall intensity might not always exacerbate the CF.

We propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to flooding at the catchment scale in data-scarce regions, combining satellite imagery with integrated high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling. All the input data needed are retrieved from freely-available global satellite products. The numerical model is also freeware. The methodology is therefore replicable worldwide. An estimate of the flood extent and exposed population during Tropical Storm Ana (January 2022) is presented as a case study. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Current freely-available satellite products in combination with high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic models can be used to estimate the population exposed to flooding in the whole catchment. This estimate is more realistic than the one obtained using satellite imagery alone, since satellite images are very rarely taken at the time of maximum flooding. Using the proposed methodology, we estimate that over 273,000 people (out of 1.5 million) were exposed to flooding in the Licungo basin during Tropical Storm Ana. This represents 18% of the basin population and is 8 times larger than the estimate obtained using only the available satellite images.

Estimation of environmental factors thresholds might provide important information for the common patterns of species distributions and management of wetland ecosystems. The laboratory experiment and the greenhouse experiment examined separately the effects of temperature (10 constant temperature regimes of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 26, 30 and 35 degrees C) and flooding depth (10 flooding depth treatments of -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15, +20, +25 and +30 cm relative to the substrate surface) on rhizome bud sprouting and establishment of Phragmites australis. Our results revealed that the final sprouting percentage, relative growth rate and ramet height showed hump-shaped relationships with temperature. Higher temperature led to shorter mean time to sprout, faster sprouting rate and greater ramet survival. The estimated base temperature for rhizome bud sprouting was 5.0 +/- 1.27 degrees C. The optimum temperature for rhizome bud sprouting and early growth might be the range of 23-30 degrees C. The final sprouting percentage, relative growth rate and ramet height showed unimodal patterns with flooding depth. The mean time to sprout was increased with deeper flooding depth, while sprouting rate and ramet survival were decreased.

J	Reiter, K; Knittel, N; Bachner, G; Hochrainer-Stigler, S				Reiter, Karina; Knittel, Nina; Bachner, Gabriel; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan			Barriers and ways forward to climate risk management against indirect effects of natural disasters: A case study on flood risk in Austria	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Indirect damages; Stakeholder mapping; Climate change; Adaptation; Flood risk management; Climate risk management	REDUCTION; PLAN	Natural disasters, such as floods, can have severe consequences, especially as economies are becoming ever more interlinked and complex so that the cascading effects of disasters can amplify direct impacts. These trends are expected to continue in the future due to climate change and changing socio-economic structures. It is therefore important to promote climate risk management strategies that also deal with indirect effects due to natural disaster events in a proactive manner. However, there is a lack of studies which investigate the agents involved in climate risk management geared towards the indirect effects of disasters and how these indirect effects are or can be dealt with. We address this gap via a detailed case study of the Austrian flood risk management apparatus. Based on a detailed stakeholder analysis, we compile a stakeholder map of those potentially involved in indirect flood risk management as well as the relationships among them (or the lack thereof). We further discuss current and future indirect risk management strategies and corresponding implementation barriers. Finally, based on the results obtained from the stakeholder process, we discuss and suggest possible ways forward to overcome these barriers to enable proactive management strategies for indirect climate risks. We find that although indirect risks are being considered in the Austrian flood risk management, they are managed to a marginal degree. To remedy this, we call for increased efforts in data collection, modelling and awareness raising and the revision of current financial as well as institutional structures. Greater focus should be put on interdependencies within systems as well as the adoption of long-term visions for establishing more integrated climate risk management against indirect effects.

In this study, according to daily precipitation data from 515 weather stations in China, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of rain-season (May-September) precipitation in China from 1960 to 2018. The results showed that rain-season precipitation decreased over China from 1960 to 2018. Rain-season heavy (25 <= p < 50 mm/day) and very heavy (p >= 50 mm/day) precipitation showed increasing trends, while rain-season moderate (10 <= p < 25 mm/day) and light (0.1 <= p < 10 mm/day) precipitation showed decreasing trends from 1960 to 2018. The temporal changes of precipitation indicated that rain-season light and moderate precipitation displayed downward trends in China from 1980 to 2010 and rain-season heavy and very heavy precipitation showed fluctuant variation from 1960 to 2018. Changes of rain-season precipitation showed clear regional differences. Northwest China and the Tibetan Plateau showed the largest positive trends of precipitation amount and days. In contrast, negative trends were found for almost all precipitation grades in North China Plain, Northeast China, and North Central China. Changes toward drier conditions in these regions probably had a severe impact on agricultural production. In East China, Southeast China and Southwest China, heavy and very heavy precipitation had increased while light and moderate precipitation had decreased. This result implied an increasing risk of flood and mudslides in these regions. The advance in understanding of precipitation change in China will contribute to exactly predict the regional climate change under the background of global climate change.

To better predict and cope with future climate change, more local and regional long-term high-resolution climate reconstructions, hydroclimate in particular, are required. Based on a 174-year regional tree-ring-width chronology, we reconstructed the February-June Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI26) history in the Luliang Mountains, North China (NC). Reconstructed SPEI26 is expected to reflect the dry-wet variation from spring to early summer (STES) of NC with an explained variance of 43.8% for the instrumental record (1951-2007 CE). The reconstruction reveals three comparatively dry (1857-1878, 1919-1929 and 1995-2001 CE) and four comparatively wet (1883-1895, 1934-1944, 1952-1961 and 1980-1984 CE) periods during 1834-2007 CE. Although a drying trend is seen since the 1950s, an advent of wetting since the end of the 1990s is expected. As the driest period in the reconstruction, 1919-1929 CE records the widespread catastrophic 1920s drought in northern China. In addition to the local hydroclimatic signal, the reconstruction also reflects hydroclimatic variation over a large portion of northern China, which is evidented by the comparison with other hydroclimatic records and regional dry-wet index. Strength of the Indian summer monsoon and the East Asian summer monsoon in the previous year play vital roles in the STES dry-wet variations. Moreover, Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation index influents the hydroclimate in NC by influencing the Asian summer monsoon system.

An integrated model of real estate market responses to coastal flooding	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; agent-based modeling; coastal flooding; housing market; resilience; spatial hedonic	ADAPTIVE ECONOMIC-BEHAVIOR; LAND-USE; PROPERTY PRICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGENT; COMPLEXITY; RISK; INSURANCE; INSIGHTS; SYSTEMS	Understanding and improving how humans adapt to climate change are priorities in our research community, and coastal settlements are good places to study adaptation. Severe storm events and sea-level rise are threatening coastal communities with increasing levels of flood damage. Because ownership of coastal assets is distributed among many private and public actors, both individual property owners and public officials must take adaptive actions. This paper introduces an integrated agent-based and hedonic pricing modeling system to simulate coastal real estate market performance under non-equilibrium conditions that reflect the effects of storm events. The modeling system, which is used for policy analysis, is calibrated to conditions in two towns in Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA, which were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The key findings are that (a) coastal real estate markets capitalize flood risk into property values but this discount diminishes rapidly as time passes between storm events, and (b) there is a distinct equity versus efficiency tradeoff in designing public policies to reduce the cost to society of coastal flooding. Stringent regulation of building practices reduces flood damage but drives away poorer home buyers and owners, whereas informational and incentive-based policies are fairer but less effective. Hands-off, market-based retreat from risky areas is socially costly but allows less wealthy people to remain at the shore, albeit in vulnerable situations. Managed retreat should emphasize improved recreational access to coastal amenities while discouraging people from living there.

Most studies have so far concentrated on temperature-sensitive sectors. Given the links between a warmer atmosphere and rainfall intensity, there is also a need to examine impact sectors driven primarily by changing rainfall characteristics. One example is soil erosion and muddy flooding from agricultural land, which damages the natural and built environment. Using a case-study hillslope in eastern Belgium-an area particularly impacted by muddy floods-this study examines (a) whether soil erosion and muddy flooding will increase in the future; and (b) whether containing GMTI to 1.5 degrees C would help limit the problem versus 2 degrees C. The Water Erosion Prediction Project model was used to simulate muddy flooding for the present-day and under a range of future scenarios derived from climate models that correspond to 1.5 and 2 degrees C GMTI. The main findings reveal no statistically significant differences between muddy flooding at 1.5 and 2 degrees C GMTI. Limiting GMTI to 1.5 degrees C therefore does not appear to make much difference to soil erosion and muddy flooding, because the timing of changing rainfall intensity does not always follow clear patterns with increased warming. Regardless of the magnitude of future warming, an earlier and longer muddy flooding season is projected-highlighting that mitigation measures should be continually adapted to remain resilient to climate change.

J	Stroombergen, A; Lawrence, J				Stroombergen, Adolf; Lawrence, Judy			A novel illustration of real options analysis to address the problem of probabilities under deep uncertainty and changing climate risk	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Real options; Dynamic adaptive pathways; Deep uncertainty; Climate change; Flood risk management	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CHANGE ADAPTATION; DECISION-MAKING; PATHWAYS; ROBUST	Changing risk profiles over time that are exacerbated by climate change, challenge assessments of the relative value of investing in different adaptation options. There is a growing discourse around methods that are better suited to addressing changing risk and uncertainties for large infrastructure projects - robust decision making (RDM), real options analysis (ROA) and those based on dynamic adaptive pathways planning (DAPP). While such approaches are receiving greater attention in the academic literature, there is a gap in critiques of them in real-life decision practice. Here we present two novel applications from New Zealand of real options analysis that formed part of actual decision processes - a flood risk management plan and a coastal hazards strategy, both based on DAPP over 100 years. In both cases, we examined the value of pursuing adaptation options that are flexible under peak river flows, coastal erosion, imminent inundation, storm surge and long-term sea-level rise. From lessons learned we examined three questions relating to ROA: 1) is ROA 'fit for purpose' for investment evaluations in situations of both imminent threat and deep uncertainty and its scalability? 2) can ROA address path dependency and move beyond static applications? 3) can ROA be used alongside DAPP to address managed retreat as an adaptation option. We conclude the affirmative for each question and provide a method for using ROA within a DAPP and RDM framework.

The tree-ring series of individual trees started between 1836 and 1931 and extended over a period of 84-180 years. The 20 dated series were utilized for constructing a tree-ring chronology. Unlike many other studies that used local anomalies such as flood pulse, precipitation, and drought events to describe the influence of El Nino on tree growth, we used monthly precipitation and ENSO indices as predictors of tree growth to calculate response and correlation functions. The study observed that tree ring growth of Cedrela odorata is influenced by precipitation in August and June of the current year and in August of the previous year, as well as by the ENSO indices SSTA, TSA, TNA, and NAO. Systematic increases in the strength of the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection due to climate change could affect the growth of trees on the Guiana Shield.

Two hydrological models (SMART and GR4J) are trained and evaluated for their ability to capture key hydrological signatures from observations before being forced with bias corrected outputs from 12 Earth System Models from the CMIP6 ensemble. Projected changes are derived for three shared socio-economic pathways (SSP126, SSP370 and SSP585) for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The results show a wide range of change in all metrics across the catchment sample. While even the direction of change is highly uncertain in spring and autumn, there is a tendency towards increased flows in winter and reduced flows in summer, together with large reductions in annual low flows. Under SSP370, the median reduction in summer flows across catchments for the 2080s simulated by GR4J is -21.3 percent (90 percent CI: 4.8 to -36.9 percent). For Q95, for the 2080s, GR4J returns a median reduction of -20.9 percent (90 percent CI: -2.5 to -38.2 percent), while SMART suggests a median reduction of -21.2 percent (90 percent CI: -6.0 to -36.9 percent). Such changes would pose significant challenges for water management, requiring significant adaptation. Notably, for low flows in particular, significant reductions in emissions under SSP126 result in more moderate future changes, indicating the importance of both adaptation and mitigation to sustainable water management.

An interdisciplinary and catchment approach to enhancing urban flood resilience: a Melbourne case	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						climate change adaptation; community visioning; flood resilience; interdisciplinary research; strategy testing; urban intensification	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; WATER; PARTICIPATION; SCIENCE; POLICY; CITY; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; PATHWAYS	This paper presents a novel interdisciplinary and catchment-based approach for exploring urban flood resilience. Our research identified and developed a diverse set of adaptation measures for Elwood, a suburb in Melbourne, Australia, that is vulnerable to pluvial and coastal flooding. We drew on methods from social science, urban design and environmental engineering to gain integrated insights into the opportunities for Elwood to increase its flood resilience and urban liveability. Results showed that an appropriate balance of social, infrastructural and urban design responses would be required to retreat from, accommodate and protect against flood risk. These would also deliver broader benefits such as securing water supplies through harvested stormwater and mitigating extreme heat through greener landscapes. Our interdisciplinary approach demonstrated the value of (i) engaging with the community to understand their concerns, aspirations and adaptation ideas, (ii) exploring design measures that densify and use urban forms in ways that implement adaptation measures while responding to local context, (iii) adopting modelling techniques to test the performance, robustness and economic viability of possible adaptation solutions, and (iv) innovating governance arrangements and principles needed to improve flood resilience in the Elster Creek catchment. Our research also provided valuable insight on how to operationalize interdisciplinary work in practice, highlighting the importance of sharing an impact agenda, taking a place-based approach, developing a common conceptual framework, and fostering a constructive team culture.

J	De Niel, J; Willems, P				De Niel, Jan; Willems, Patrick			Climate or land cover variations: what is driving observed changes in river peak flows? A data-based attribution study	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RUNOFF GENERATION; FLOOD; URBANIZATION; STREAMFLOW; EUROPE	Climate change and land cover changes are influencing the hydrological regime of rivers worldwide. In Flanders (Belgium), the intensification of the hydrological cycle caused by climate change is projected to cause more flooding in winters, and land use and land cover changes could amplify these effects by, for example, making runoff on paved surfaces faster. The relative importance of both drivers, however, is still uncertain, and interaction effects between both drivers are not yet well understood. In order to better understand the hydrological impact of climate variations and land cover changes, including their interaction effects, we fitted a statistical model for historical data over 3 decades for 29 catchments in Flanders. The model is able to explain 60 % of the changes in river peak flows over time. It was found that catchment characteristics explain up to 18 % of changes in river peak flows, 6 % of changes in climate variability and 8 % of land cover changes. Steep catchments and catchments with a high proportion of loamic soils are subject to higher peak flows, and an increase in urban area of 1 % might cause increases in river peak flows up to 5 %. Interactions between catchment characteristics, climate variations and land cover changes explain up to 32 % of the peak-flow changes, where flat catchments with a low loamic soil content are more sensitive to land cover changes with respect to peak-flow anomalies. This shows the importance of including such interaction terms in data-based attribution studies.

To mitigate the societal impact of hydrological and hydraulic extremes, knowledge of the processes leading to these extreme events is vital. Hydrological modelling is one of the main tools in this quest for knowledge but comes with uncertainties. For that it is necessary to deeply study the impact of hydrological models' structure on the magnitude and timing of extreme rainfall-runoff events. This paper is mainly aimed to show the development of a method called "HydroPredicT_Extreme " based on Bayesian Causal Modelling (BCM), a technique within Artificial Intelligence (AI). This method may enhance predictive capacity of extreme rainfall-runoff events. "Hydro-PredicT_Extreme " follows an iterative methodology that comprise 2 main stages. First one comprises a mixed graphical/analytical method from Hydrograph. This stage is conditioned by two initial constraints which are, a) pluviometry station is representative of hydrograph downstream flow behaviour; b) there must be independence of events. This first stage comprises sub-phases such as: 1.1. Calculation of Response Time (RT) through a mixed graphical/analytical approach, 1.2 Subtraction of RT from the flow series to remove the Rainfall-Flow delay; 1.3 Calculation base flow rate; 1.4 Subtraction base-flow from flow series to work on absolute inputs. Second man stage is called Bayesian Causal Modelling Translation (BCMT) that comprises the 2.1 Learning, 2.2 Training, 2.3 Simulation through BCM modelling, 2.4 Sensitivity Analysis-Validation. This whole methodology will become a digital application and software that could be extrapolated to several similar case studies. This may be coupled with posterior devices for the prevention of catastrophic flood consequences in the form of MultiHazard-Early Warning System (MH-EWS) or others.

A GIS based flood vulnerability modelling of Anambra State using an integrated IVFRN-DEMATEL-ANP model	HELIYON			English	Article						GIS; Flooding; Vulnerability assessment; Climate change; Nigeria	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUROPEAN CITIES; URBANIZATION; HOUSEHOLDS; IMPACTS; PLANT	Flooding is a major environmental problem facing Anambra State of Nigeria, which also threatens food security in the state. To address this issue, continual flood vulnerability mapping exploring more efficient methods is needed to facilitate flood risk management in the state. The advantages of employing spatial information technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) in flood vulnerability mapping has been widely documented; the limitations of employing GIS alone in effective vulnerability analysis have also been documented by researchers. To overcome these limitations, this study adopted the use of GIS and the integration of Interval Value Fuzzy Rough Number (IVFRN), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Analytical Network Process (ANP) method in vulnerability assessment of flood hazard. The result of the study shows that the state is very vulnerable to flood with 73% of the total area of the state lying between Very High and Medium vulnerable zones. The most vulnerable Local Government Area (LGA) in the State is Anambra West with 95% of the total area of the LGA lying between Very High and Medium vulnerable zones. Furthermore, the obtained values of (R) over tilde - (D ) over tilde show that Rainfall Intensity factor is the major cause of flood in the study area with the highest positive value of 1.55 and Soil factor is the major effect with the highest negative value of -0.93. The IVFRN-DEMATEL-ANP assessment model was validated using AUC-ROC method; an AUC value of 0.946 was obtained, this indicates that the model has excellent prediction accuracy. This study was able to establish the feasibility of integrating the IVFRN, DEMATEL and ANP methods in flood vulnerability assessment. It is recommended that the provision of adequate drainage systems should be prioritized to areas of high flood vulnerability index; to help mitigate flood hazards in the State. Also, strategic planning of infrastructures and emergency routes for moving people and key assets from vulnerable areas especially during the rainy season should be geospatial-based and systematic.

Different meteorological event conditions were examined, such as events of high precipitation intensity, double hydrological peak, and mainly normal to wet antecedent moisture conditions. Analysis of the hydrometric features of the precipitation events was conducted by comparing the different rainfall time intervals, the total volume of water, and the precedent soil moisture. Parameter model calibration and validation were performed for rainfall events under similar conditions, examined in pairs, in order to verify two hydrological models, the lumped HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System model) and the semi-distributed HBV-light (a recent version of Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model), at the exit of six individual gauged sub-basins. Model verification was achieved by using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and volume error index. Different time of concentration (T-c) formulas are better applied to the sub-watersheds with respect to the dominant land uses, classifying the T-c among the most sensitive parameters that influence the time of appearance and the magnitude of the peak modeled flow through the HEC-HMS model. The maximum water content of the soil box (FC) affects most the peak flow via the HBV-light model, whereas the MAXBAS parameter has the greatest effect on the displayed time of peak discharge. The modeling results show that the HBV-light performed better in the events that had less precipitation volume compared to their pairs. The event with the higher total precipitated water produced better results with the HEC-HMS model, whereas the rest of the two high precipitation events performed satisfactorily with both models. April to July is a flood hazard period that will be worsened with the effect of climate change. The suggested calibrated parameters for severe precipitation events can be used for the prediction of future events with similar features. The above results can be used in the water resources management of the basin.

Private groundwater contamination and extreme weather events: The role of demographics, experience and cognitive factors on risk perceptions of Irish private well users	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Extreme weather events; Groundwater contamination; Risk perception	DRINKING-WATER QUALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS; ENTERIC DISEASE; ADAPTATION; COMMUNITIES; BEHAVIORS; HEALTH; IMPACT; PREPAREDNESS	Extreme weather events (EWEs) may significantly increase pathogenic contamination of private (unregulated) groundwater supplies. However, due to the paucity of protective guidance, private well users may be illequipped to undertake adaptive actions. With rising instances of waterborne illness documented in groundwater-dependent, developed regions such as the Republic of Ireland, a better understanding of well user risk perceptions pertaining to EWEs is required to establish appropriate educational interventions. To this end, the current study employed an online and physical questionnaire to identify current risk perceptions and correspondent predictors among Irish private well users concerning extreme weather. Respondents were elicited via purposive sampling, with 515 private well users elucidating perceived supply contamination risk in the wake of five EWEs between the years 2013-2018 including drought and pluvial flooding. A novel scoring protocol was devised to quantify overall risk perception (i.e. perceived likelihood, severity and consequences) of extreme weather impacts. Overall risk perception of EWEs was found to demonstrate a significant relationship with gender (p = 0.017) and event experience (p < 0.001), with female respondents and those reporting prior event experience exhibiting higher median risk perception scores. Risk perception was additionally mediated by perceived self-efficacy in undertaking supply maintenance (p = 0.001), as well users citing confidence in ability scored significantly lower than those citing no confidence. Two-step cluster analysis identified three distinct respondent subsets based on risk perception of EWEs (high, moderate and low perception), with female respondents and those with a third-level education significantly more likely to fall within the high perception cluster. Study findings affirm that certain demographic, experiential and cognitive factors exert a significant influence on private well user risk perceptions of EWE impacts and highlight potential focal points for future educational interventions seeking to reduce the risk of human infection associated with groundwater and extreme weather.

J	Xu, Z; Zhang, SH; Yang, XY				Xu, Zan; Zhang, Shanghong; Yang, Xiyan			Water and sediment yield response to extreme rainfall events in a complex large river basin: A case study of the Yellow River Basin, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Complex large river basin; Extreme rainfall; Water and sediment variation; SWAT; Yellow River basin	LOESS PLATEAU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; SOIL-EROSION; LAND-USE; RUNOFF; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; LOAD	A considerable variability in water and sediment induced by climate change was shown to have a significant impact on a comprehensive management of complex large river basins. In this study, a basin-scale model of the water and sediment yield was established through using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess the spatio-temporal response of water and sediment in the Yellow River Basin to extreme rainfall events. Also, an additional set of reservoir regulation and water consumption modules was incorporated in the SWAT, then a task of model calibration and validation was done using discrete regional units and a basin-scale simulation of intensive human activities was successfully implemented. Two basic indices including precipitation concentration degree (PCD) and the spatial distribution of maximum precipitation were used to characterize extreme rainfall events. Several extreme rainfall scenarios were specified to investigate the response of water and sediment variations in this river basin. Our results show that (i) the accuracy of SWAT in predicting water and sediment yield in complex large river basins was apparently improved if taking intensive human activities into account; and (ii) it is shown that changes in slope water and sediment yield are broadly coherent with changes in extreme rainfall patterns in the Yellow River Basin, but there is a significant difference in the response of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events among different regions. Specifically, if the PCD was greater than 0.435, the slope sediment yield during the flood season in monitoring reaches from Toudaoguai to Tongguan is in excess of 128.57 t/ha, indicative of severe erosion. Annual river runoff and transported sediment was 52.5 billion m(3) and 443 million tons, respectively, at the Tongguan hydrological station. These results could be used a reference for identifying the characteristics and trends of temporal and spatial changes in water and sediment yield under extreme rainfall events, thereby assisting decision making.

J	Kapetas, L; Fenner, R				Kapetas, Leon; Fenner, Richard			Integrating blue-green and grey infrastructure through an adaptation pathways approach to surface water flooding	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						flooding; sustainable drainage systems; adaptative planning; adaptation pathways; multiple benefits	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; DEEP UNCERTAINTY; RISK-MANAGEMENT; REAL OPTIONS; ROBUST; POINTS; COST	A range of solutions to future flood risk are available ranging from blue-green infrastructure (BGI) as commonly incorporated in sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) to traditional grey infrastructure (e.g. pipe networks, storage tanks, flood walls). Each offers a different profile with respect to costs, flexibility of implementation and the ability to deliver a range of wider benefits beyond their flood protection function. An important question that must be addressed when considering these approaches is what is the most suitable mix of grey and blue-green solutions to urban flooding at any location and at any future time? This paper uses an adaptation pathways approach to compare a range of alternative options to deal with current and expected future flood risk in part of a London borough. Solutions considered separately and in combination include grey pipe expansion, bioretention cells, permeable pavements and storage ponds. A methodological framework combines a range of existing tools to develop, assess and characterize each pathway, including a storm water management model (SWMM), a SuDs opportunity selection tool, an adaptation pathway generator and the CIRIA B ST pound tool for monetizing multiple benefits. Climate change is represented by the UK Water Industry Research method for establishing future rainfall intensities for sewer and BGI design. The results showed that by extending the way in which adaptation pathways are compared and evaluated through the wider consideration of multiple benefits there is a trade-off between deferring interventions until they are needed for flood risk mitigation and delivering the multiple benefits associated with interventions so that performance thresholds do not need to be met before introducing new options. The relative contribution of each option's capital and operation and maintenance costs has implications on when the option is implemented as well as the rate of implementation. The monetization of the multiple benefits associated with each pathway shows that their economic co-evaluation alongside infrastructure costs can change the preference for one pathway over another. This article is part of the theme issue 'Urban flood resilience'.

Coasts and coastal communities are increasingly at risk. In addition to short-term events, long-term changes, including rising sea levels, increasing storm intensity, and consequent severe compound flooding events are degrading coastal ecosystems and threatening coastal dwellers. Consequently, people living near the coast require environmental intelligence in the form of reliable short-term and long-term predictions in order to anticipate, prepare for, adapt to, resist, and recover from hazards. Risk-informed decision making is crucial, but for the resulting information to be actionable, it must be effectively and promptly communicated to planners, decision makers and emergency managers in readily understood terms and formats. The information, critical to forecasts of extreme weather and flooding, as well as long-term projections of future risks, must involve synergistic interplay between observations and models. In addition to serving data for assimilation into models, the observations are also essential for objective validation of models via hind casts. Linked observing and modeling programs that involve stakeholder input and integrate engineering, environmental, and community vulnerability are needed to evaluate conditions prior to and following severe storm events, to update baselines, and to plan for future changes over the long term. In contrast to most deep-sea phenomena, coastal vulnerabilities are locally and regionally specific and prioritization of the most important observational data and model predictions must rely heavily on input from local and regional communities and decision makers. Innovative technologies and nature-based solutions are already helping to reduce vulnerability from coastal hazards in some localities but more focus on local circumstances, as opposed to global solutions, is needed. Agile and spatially distributed response capabilities will assist operational organizations in predicting, preparing for and mitigating potential community-wide disasters. This white paper outlines the rationale, synthesizes recent literature and summarizes some data-driven approaches to coastal resilience.	[Nichols, C.

The open marine ecosystems of the Langhian and Serravallian seas progressively collapsed and were replaced in the Tortonian by large endorheic lakes. These lakes experienced major fluctuations in water level, directly reflecting the palaeoclimatic conditions of the region. An extreme lowstand of the Eastern Paratethys lake (-300 m) during the regional Khersonian stage reveals a period of intensely dry conditions in Central Eurasia causing a fragmentation of the Paratethys region. This period of "Great Drying" ended by a climate change towards more humid conditions at the base of the Maeotian stage, resulting in a large transgressive event that reconnected most of the Paratethyan basins. The absence of a robust time frame for the Khersonian-Maeotian interval hampers a direct correlation with the global records and complicates a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we present a new chronostratigraphic framework for the Khersonian and Maeotian deposits of the Dacian Basin of Romania, based on integrated magneto-biostratigraphic studies on long and continuous sedimentary successions. We show the dry climate conditions in the Khersonian start at 8.6-8.4 Ma. The Khersonian/Maeotian transition is dated at 7.65-7.5 Ma, several million years younger than previous estimates. The Maeotian transgression occurs later (7.5-7.4 Ma) in more marginal and shallower basins, in agreement with the time transgressive character of the flooding. In addition, we date a sudden water level drop of the Eastern Paratethys lake, the Intra-Maeotian Event (IME), at 6.9 Ma, and hypothesize that this corresponds to a reconnection phase with the Aegean basin of the Mediterranean. Finally, we discuss the potential mechanisms explaining the particularities of the Maeotian transgression and conclude that the low salinity and the seemingly "marine influxes" most likely correspond to episodes of intrabasinal mixing in a gradual and pulsating transgressive setting.

The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and IPCC-LVI framework were applied for analysing the vulnerability of Mirpur Slum (MPS) and Rail-line Slum (RLS) in Dhaka city. The findings indicate that slum settlements with similar characteristics could have different levels of vulnerability due to their households' attributes and the characteristics of the surrounding neighbourhoods. This study provides insights of livelihood vulnerability of the urban poor which appeals for effective urban flood adaptation strategies through enhancing public health, water access and food security for the slum dwellers. The findings and recommendations derived from this study are likely applicable to other cities in Bangladesh and to other countries including global south with similar socio-economic profiles.

An approach for investigating the uncertainty in extreme flood modeling is proposed. Using different calibration objectives, several automatic calibrations of the University of British Columbia watershed model (UBCWM) are conducted and the resulting collection of optimal combinations of parameter values are used to simulate the extreme event. An application to the Coquitlam River Watershed above Coquitlam Dam in southwestern British Columbia shows that the variability among the PMF estimates is relatively small in comparison with the potential uncertainties in estimating extreme events, with coefficient of variation values for peak flow, event volume, and time to peak of 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. The PMF-based simulations are relatively insensitive to the different measures of calibration performances.	[Roche, A.

Yet, because of the lack of long records spanning multiple glacial cycles and deglaciation events, it is unclear whether deoxygenation was a regular occurrence of warming events and whether deglaciation and/or other conditions promoted hypoxia throughout time. Here, subarctic Pacific laminated sediments from the past 1.2 million years demonstrate that hypoxic events recurred throughout the Pleistocene as episodes of highly productive phytoplankton growth and were generally associated with interglacial climates, high sea levels, and enhanced nitrate utilization-but not with deglaciations. We suggest that hypoxia was typically stimulated by high productivity from iron fertilization facilitated by redox-remobilized iron from flooded continental shelves.

To examine how lenders account for extreme weather, we compare matched repeat mortgage and property transactions around a severe flood event in England in 2013-14. First, lender va-luations do not "mark-to-market" against local price declines. As a result valuations are biased upwards. Second, lenders do not offset this valuation bias by adjusting interest rates or loan amounts. Third, bor-rowers with low credit risk self-select into high flood risk areas. Overall, these results suggest that lenders do not track closely the impact of extreme weather ex-post , and that public flood insurance programs subsidize high income households in some areas.

Governance of flood risk data: A comparative analysis of government and insurance geospatial data for identifying properties at risk of flood	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Governance; Geospatial data; Flood; Insurance; Risk management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUTURE; FRAMEWORK; LOSSES	Flood risk maps are essential sources of information for flood risk management (FRM) decisions. Commercial flood models used by the insurance industry are rarely studied in the academic literature which has led to difficulties in understanding their sources of uncertainty and opportunities for improvement. This paper compares regions and residential properties identified as exposed to floods by an insurance industry model and by government authorities responsible for FRM in three Canadian cities. Findings show that the insurance model is identifying substantially greater number of regions and properties as at-risk of flood, and little overlap exists between public and private flood maps. The paper discusses opportunities for data integration and increased data transparency for supporting flood resiliency efforts in Canada.

They relocate, evacuate their homes temporarily, change cropping patterns, and supplement their income from migrating household members. In this way, they can reduce the negative impact of floods on their livelihoods. However, these societal responses also have negative outcomes, such as impoverishment. This research collects quantitative household data and analyzes changes of livelihood conditions over recent decades in a large floodplain area in north-west Bangladesh. It is found that while residents cope with flooding events, they do not achieve successful adaptation. With every flooding, people lose income and assets, which they can only partially recover. As such, they are getting poorer, and therefore less able to make structural adjustments that would allow adaptation in the longer term.

Climate change research for the Northern Song Dynasty era has significance for understanding the interaction between agricultural civilizations in the central plains and nomadic populations in northern China, transfer of the economic and cultural centers of China, and the vicissitudes of the Northern Song Dynasty. There is currently considerable disagreement regarding climate change in the Central Plain during the Northern Song Dynasty era. Many precious and valuable historical documents and records about the Northern Song Dynasty have been collected, and abundant records of sunspot activity, cold and warm weather, drought and flood events have been compiled. Using the Mann-Kendall test, wavelet analysis, R/S analysis, and frequency analysis etc. mathematical statistics methods, sunspot activity, cold and warm events, and drought and flood events were quantitatively reconstructed. There are 15 sunspot maximum years and 16 sunspot minimum years, the cycle length of sunspot activity is 8-14 years, and the average cycle length is 11 years. Hot years account for 11.3% of the total years; warm years account for 12.7%; cold years account for 20.7%; and freezing cold years account for 3.3%. Mann-Kendall test results show that cold and warm variations are natural fluctuations, and there is no indication of abrupt climate change during the Northern Song Dynasty. Morlet wavelet analysis indicates that there are weak high-frequency oscillations and short oscillation periods with three years before 1052 AD, and there are oscillation periods of six years and clear alternations between warmth and cold during 1060-1120 AD. R/S analysis indicates that the Hurst index (II) of cold and warm index series is 0.6155, and the fractal dimension (D) is 1.3845. Since 0.5 < H < 1 and 1 < D < 1.5, fractal structures are evident in the time series of cold and warm indexes, past increments are positively correlated with future increments, and the average cycle length in the time series for cold and warm indexes is 6 years. Temperatures first decreased rapidly followed by a slow increase with long-term fluctuations, and the mean temperature during the Northern Song Dynasty era is 0.4 degrees C higher than that in the period 1880-1979 AD. Severe drought, moderate drought, moderate flood, severe flood and normal years account for 15.3%, 25.3%, 11.3%, 6.7%, 41.4% of all years, respectively. Frequency analysis indicates that cooling, warming, drought and flood events show a close relationship to sunspot activity.

PARASITOLOGY			English	Review						Drought; fire; flood; natural disasters; parasites	OUTBREAK; FIRE; SHEEP; ECHINOCOCCOSIS; TRANSMISSION; MILWAUKEE; EVOLUTION; ABUNDANCE; SURVIVAL; IMPACT	Parasites and parasitologists have always lived together in good and bad luck in a sort of forced marriage. In recent times bad luck certainly prevailed, because of increasing man-made emergencies such as wars, chemical disasters, but also because of natural disasters, amplified by climate change, that condition more and more parasite-host equilibrium. The symposium at the National Congress of the Italian Society for Parasitology, was a first occasion for Italian parasitologists to reason about 'disaster parasitology' and researchers' responsibilities. Extreme weather events and their impacts on parasites' epidemiology are illustrated, comparing disasters that recently occurred in Italy with literature data. In particular, the Sardinian Island was hit subsequently by fires and floods exacerbating the effects on ecosystems and parasite-host-relationships. Examples of Cryptosporidium outbreaks in man and Fasciola hepatica infections in various hosts after heavy rains are reviewed and effects of droughts on pasture borne parasites, such as gastro-intestinal nematodes of ruminants are discussed. Heavy rains may also cause dissemination of toxic substances released accidentally from chemical plants as happened e.g. in Milan province (IT) after the dioxin hazard. The overlapping effects of strictly man-made disasters with climate change dependent extreme weather events is further challenging the understanding of what are the consequences of disasters on ecosystems and parasite epidemiology. GIS applications combined with AI programs may help to face the complex challenges, allowing the collection and analysis of spatial/temporal data at whatever level desired. Examples illustrated in the article suggest their employment also in a more systematic, prevention-oriented manner.

J	Yazdani, M; Haghani, M				Yazdani, Maziar; Haghani, Milad			Elderly people evacuation planning in response to extreme flood events using optimisation-based decision-making systems: A case study in western Sydney, Australia	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Natural hazards; Evacuation planning; Elderly people; Extreme floods; Sydney	NSGA-II; MODEL; MANAGEMENT	Climate change is causing an increase in the frequency and severity of floods in various regions globally, raising concerns about the efficacy of evacuation planning strategies that were created under different climate scenarios, particularly for vulnerable individuals. Urban areas are at high risk of flooding, making the evacuation of elderly people to safer locations a potential necessity in many future flooding situations. However, despite the significance of transportation planning in the evacuation of the elderly, there has been little research considering the impact of disasters on the areas undergoing evacuation. This paper aims to address this research gap by presenting an integrated evacuation approach for elderly people under flooding conditions. The proposed model combines a flood simulator with multi -objective metaheuristic algorithms to minimise the expected evacuation time for all evacuees and reduce the number of rescue vehicles used. To improve the performance of the optimisation algorithms, dominant properties are established, which are used to create a local search. The proposed approach is tested and validated using a case study in Sydney, Australia, and the findings suggest that the proposed method can generate effective evacuation plans for the elderly in a reasonable amount of time under realistic emergency scenarios brought on by extreme flood events. The study adds to the body of knowledge on disaster risk reduction strategies both theoretically and practically, and has crucial policy implications for emergency managers, planners, and decision-makers in countries where urban areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the differences in context, climate change contributed to these events. Flood resilience generally means the system's ability to recover from floods. A post-flood resilience assessment seeks to determine the impact of the flood on the area, the duration it took to recover, the effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce the risk of flooding, and ways to enhance flood resilience. The post-flood review capacity method was used to assess the event and calculate the flood resilience index. Western Germany experienced a 500-year return period flood in connection with the low-pressure system, Bernd, while Zhengzhou in Henan experienced a 1000-year return period flood with the influence of Typhoon In-Fa and the Western Pacific subtropical high. More than 107,000 people were affected in Germany, with 205 deaths that account for USD 40 billion in economic losses, whereas in Henan, 14.786 million people were affected, and 398 people died, which accounts for USD 18.9 billion in losses. Germany was more impacted and took longer to restore essential services than Henan, China. The flood resilience index shows that the resilience level of both countries is low. The severe rainstorms in Zhengzhou and the Ahr River Valley exposed weaknesses in urban disaster management, particularly in urban areas, such as subway flooding and risk communication with the public. The events highlighted the need to better understand risks and their consequences, early warning systems, preparedness, and emergency response.

To design conservation plans, a scientific understanding of snake habitats in light of environmental and climatic variables is an essential prerequisite. For venomous snakes, denoting favourable habitats should also be relevant for snakebite management. We have considered 18 spatial variables to portray the range of terrestrial venomous snake distribution in Bangladesh. Our results indicate that the distribution of 29 studied venomous snakes in this country is primarily driven by climatic and environmental variables. We found that especially low elevation and flood risk constrain the distribution of those terrestrial snakes, i.e. regular floods in central Bangladesh push venomous snakes towards the edges of the country. Moreover, none of these species occupies the whole of its anticipated climatically favourable area. Projections into the future indicated that 11 studied species, Amphiesma platyceps, Boiga siamensis, Chrysopelea ornata, Pseudoxenodon macrops, Rhabdophis himalayanus, Rhabdophis subminiatus, Bungarus lividus, Ophiophagus hannah, Daboia russelii, Ovophis monticola and Trimeresurus popeiorum will lose their entire climatically suitable area within the country. Therefore, we suggest establishing more protected areas in the hilly ecosystems in the eastern part and in the mangrove forests in the south-western corner of Bangladesh to mitigate future extinction risks, such as climate change, sea-level rise and increase in flood severity. Conserving village forests and croplands, which are subject to rapid change, will also need to be addressed equally, as these are inhabited by almost one-third of the studied species. The occurrence of the cobras and kraits in village forests and cropland dominant habitats demands more attention to minimise snakebite related mortality and morbidity.

A systematic review of research on flood risk management in West Africa	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Review						Flood; Residual risk; Risk management; West Africa; Systematic review	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COPING STRATEGIES; ANAMBRA STATE; RIVER-BASIN; ADAPTATION; HOUSEHOLDS; VULNERABILITY; LAGOS; COMMUNITIES; GOVERNANCE	Flood events in West Africa have devastating impacts on the lives of people. Additionally, developments such as climate change, settlement expansion into flood-prone areas, and modification of rivers are expected to increase flood risk in the future. Policy documents have issued calls for conducting local risk assessments and understanding disaster risk in diverse aspects, leading to an increase in such research. Similarly, in a shift from flood protection to flood risk management, the consideration of various dimensions of flood risk, the necessity of addressing flood risk through an integrated strategy containing structural and non-structural measures, and the presence of residual risk are critical perspectives raised. However, the notion of "residual risk" remains yet to be taken up in flood risk management-related academic literature. This systematic review seeks to approach the notion of residual risk by reviewing information on flood impacts, common measures, and recommendations in academic literature. The review reveals various dimensions of impacts from residual flood risk aside from material damage, in particular, health impacts and economic losses. Infrastructural measures were a dominant category of measures before and after flood events and in recommendations, despite their shortcomings. Also, spatial planning interventions, a more participatory and inclusive governance approach, including local knowledge, sensitisation, and early warning systems, were deemed critical. In the absence of widespread access to insurance schemes, support from social networks after flood events emerged as the most frequent measure. This finding calls for in-depth assessments of those networks and research on potential complementary formal risk transfer mechanisms.

N.; Lama, Achal			Modelling annual maximum temperature of India: a distributional approach	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							GUMBEL DISTRIBUTION; EXTREMES	A random variable can take very large or very small values known as extreme values. In some instances, the researcher's interest lies mainly on these extreme values like maximum (or minimum) temperature, maximum (or minimum) amount of precipitations, maximum level of flood water, maximum (or minimum) wind speed, maximum (or minimum) level of disease, or pest infestation in a particular crop or season. These types of extreme values can be modelled by generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, theorized by McFadden in 1978. The type I GEV distribution, i.e. Gumbel distribution, has been extensively studied by many authors, but due to its constant skewness and kurtosis, it has limited practical application. To this end, different generalizations of Gumbel distribution have been proposed in different pieces of literature. In this manuscript, generalized degrees umbel (GG) distribution is obtained from generalized multivariate Gumbel (GMVGB) distribution specified in Demirhan and Hamurkaroglu (Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 141(Adeyemi and Ojo 2003):1141-1152, 2011) and different properties of this distribution have been derived. The continuous increasing of atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, mainly due to human activity, has led to global climate change. Climate change can in turn modify the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather and climate events-heat waves and sea-level rise. In the present study, one such climatic variable, i.e. the annual maximum temperature data of India, has been taken for the period of 1901 to 2017 and various extreme value distributions, namely GEV, Gumbel and GG, have been fitted. The obtained results indicate that the GG distribution is better fitted than the other two competing distributions.	[Gurung, Bishal; Sarkar, Krishna Pada; Singh, K.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Agri-environment; Climate change; Sediment sources; Catchment management; Sustainability; Farm management	FLUVIAL SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; DIFFUSE WATER-POLLUTION; RIVER OUSE; CATCHMENT; MITIGATION; ENGLAND; AGRICULTURE; EROSION; LAND; UK	Soil erosion and sediment losses are likely to increase with projected climate change and increasing storm intensity, causing detrimental impacts to agriculture and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Agri-environment initiatives aim to mitigate these losses through farmer engagement and incentivisation for best practice. There is, however, limited evidence regarding the impacts of their delivery and their capacity to deliver resilience to extreme wet weather. As such, the aim of this study was to determine how fine-grained sediment provenance changes with flow condition in eight high priority English catchments targeted through a strategic agrienvironment initiative and to compare the estimated sediment source proportions to the targeted advice being delivered to farmers. The provenance of fine-grained sediment was determined using sediment source fingerprinting over low flow conditions and the winter of 2019-2020 which was characterised by severe flooding. Details on the advice delivered to farmers through the Catchment Sensitive Farming initiative were obtained from a delivery agency database and interviews with catchment officers. Dominant sediment sources varied considerably between catchments and were not easily predicted based upon their characteristics meaning that targeting on-farm advice effectively is challenging. Critically, however, changes in sediment sources rarely occurred with the extreme wet winter of 2019-2020. It is recommended that the greater availability of empirical catchment-specific evidence could significantly improve the delivery of such agri-environment initiatives. In the current absence of this evidence an assumption that riparian woodland is effective at preventing sediment losses and the targeting of advice to sediment sources proportionally based upon the area of the catchment they cover may improve the benefits of such initiatives.

J	Beltaos, S; Bonsal, B				Beltaos, Spyros; Bonsal, Barrie			Climate change impacts on Peace River ice thickness and implications to ice-jam flooding of Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate warming; Climate model; Ice jam; Ice thickness; Probability distribution; Thermal breakup	MODEL; CMIP5; HYDROLOGY	Major ice jams forming in lower reaches of the Peace River during spring breakup have been identified as the main agents of flooding and replenishment of perched basins of the Peace?Athabasca Delta, one of the world?s largest inland freshwater deltas that supports a dynamic and valuable ecosystem. The paucity of ice jamming in the lower Peace River following construction of the Bennett Dam and the potential impacts of climate change have raised concerns regarding habitat degradation. One of the factors controlling ice-jam formation is the thickness of the winter ice cover, which may decrease in the future as a result of climatic warming, known to be most pronounced in northern parts of the globe and during the winter season. Using downscaled daily output from six Global Climate Models under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, ice thickness is calculated for the years 1950 to 2100. Comparisons of monthly model-generated air temperatures and winter snowfall to historical data at nearby Fort Chipewyan indicate satisfactory agreement in terms of both magnitude and variability. Future projections show that under the highest emission scenario, average thickness decreases by about 0.2 m between the 1980s and the 2050s; and by an additional 0.1 m by the 2080s. Projected probability distributions of ice thickness point to increased incidence of thermal breakup, potentially reducing the alreadylow chances of ice-jam flooding. At the same time, a need for enhanced ice thickness monitoring is identified, aiming to develop a database of annual thickness values at selected sites within the lower reach of Peace River.

J	Gussmann, G; Hinkel, J				Gussmann, Geronimo; Hinkel, Jochen			A framework for assessing the potential effectiveness of adaptation policies: Coastal risks and sea-level rise in the Maldives	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Policy effectiveness; Climate policy integration; Small island state; Flood risk; Mainstreaming	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; LEAST DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; IMPLEMENTATION; COHERENCE	Effective policies that integrate climate change considerations are crucial for successful adaptation to increasing climate risks. While there is an abundant normative literature proposing potential effective ways to adapt, there is a lack of empirical literature on current risk and adaptation policy and its potential effectiveness. Studying existing policies can help to reveal existing constraints, draw inferences about performance and design future policies. However, there is no established method for assessing risk management and adaptation policies. Addressing these gaps, we developed an analytical framework, combining and extending existing approaches, to assess the potential policy effectiveness in dealing with climate risks. The framework merges aspects of climate integration, policy coherence and compliance. Applying this framework to coastal risk management and coastal adaptation policies in the Maldives, we conducted a desk review of policy documents and semi-structured interviews with coastal policy experts and stakeholders. We find five policies addressing coastal risks and adaptation. One of these integrates sea-level rise considerations but is not legally binding. A key constraint on policy coherence are static approaches that ignore the variance in hydrodynamic hazard across the archipelago. Moreover, compliance is constrained by low capacities to monitor actual land use, political influence on the allocation of coastal protections and insufficient coastal protection budgets. Based on these findings, we expect that coastal policies are ill-prepared for dealing with sea-level rise and that scaling-up sea-level rise integration into policy is a critical first step towards improving this.

Based on twelve GCM outputs under historical, RCP4.5 and the observations at 32 rainfall stations, the equidistant cumulative distribution function matching method (EDCDFm) was utilized to bias correct daily precipitation during the historical (1961-2005) and future (2021-2080) periods. Four precipitation indices combinations were introduced based on eight precipitation indices to characterize the regional-scale changes of precipitation events, which designate the duration, intensity and amount of heavy and weak precipitation in a year. Their dependence structures were captured by Copulas. Kendall return period (KRP) were applied to discuss hazard scenarios and we quantified the spatial variability of KRPs under different marginal values. The results indicated that projected precipitation characteristics including the average intensity, the amount of annual precipitation, the intensity and amount of extreme precipitation together with annual extremes displayed increasing trends, while the changes of consecutive wet and dry days did not present pronounced trends. Decreased KRPs in the vast majority of the territory manifested that the frequency of simultaneous floods and droughts in a year as well as that of extreme heavy precipitation events would augment. Obvious spatial heterogeneity of the changes of KRP was partly attributed to the topography difference, especially the coastal areas along the main stream of the Huaihe River. Consequently, there will be a higher risk of water resources-related issues in this region for upcoming decades.

Due to the coexistence and rapid transformation of drought and flood, the drought-flood abrupt alternation events is often more harmful and threatening than the single drought or flood event to the security of the society. This study is to synthetically evaluate the evolving characteristics of drought, flood, and drought-flood abrupt alternation events under climate change, which are identified by using the Standard Weighted Average Precipitation (SWAP) index. The variability of drought, flood, and drought-flood abrupt alternation events in the future is predicted by using GCM projections, whose outputs are corrected by using a daily bias correction method. The results show that: (1) The SWAP index has the capability to judge reliably the onset, duration, and intensity over the study areas, and can be used to monitor drought-flood abrupt alternation events efficiently; (2) In the reference period (1961-2005), for the drought-flood abrupt alternation events, the frequency has a downward trend in the upper reaches and an upward trend in the lower reaches, and the spatial distribution of intensity shows a contrary law to that of frequency; (3) The frequency and intensity of drought-flood abrupt alternation events show an upward trend in the whole basin in the future period (2021-2095), under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

Results of the climate change model's precipitation data for the period 1970-2100 show a decreasing trend of daily precipitation but of higher intensity. Post-flood field investigation from a severe rainfall event in a small ungauged basin located in northwest Crete produced a validated flow hydrograph, and in combination with two high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), were used in the 1D/2D HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System model), in order to determine the flooded area extent. Lateral structures were designed along the stream's overbanks, hydraulically connecting the 1D streamflow with the 2D flow areas behind levees. Manning's roughness coefficient and the weir coefficient were the most crucial parameters in the estimation of floodplain extent. The combined 1D/2D hydraulic model provides more detailed results than the 1D model with regards to the floodplain extent at the peak outflow, maximum flood depths, and wave velocities. Furthermore, modeling with a DEM at 2 m spatial resolution showed more precise water depth output and inundated floodplains. Scenarios of increasing peak precipitation for the same event precipitation depth were used to identify the flood extent due to an increase in daily rainfall recorded by adjacent meteorological stations. These simulation results can be useful in flood risk mapping and informing civil protective measures in flood basin management, for an effective adaptation to increased flood risk caused by a changing climate.

A modified Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen & x0027;s slope estimator were utilized to test the significance and the magnitude of trends, respectively. The magnitude of significant trends for three variables between six agroecological zones (AEZs) was compared. Gridded climate data represented gauge data with high accuracy and, therefore, can reliably complement the sparse observation network in West Africa. The three variables showed significant positive and negative trends of varying magnitude and spatial extent. June to September rainfall showed a positive increase (0.1 & x2013;5 mm & x002F;month & x002F;year) that mostly occurred north of 11 & x00B0; latitude. October rainfall showed a positive trend across the region, but the magnitude was higher south of the same latitude. A widespread significant warming trend was observed across all AEZs and months. However, a localized cooling in August and September over the Sahel and Sudan Savanna was an exception. The cooling over the two AEZs coincided with a positive trend of rainfall. The zonal analysis revealed that the magnitude of the positive trend of June, September, and October rain increased following a North & x2013;South gradient from the Sahel to humid forest AEZs. Results provide spatial evidence of climate change in a limited data environment to guide the targeting of appropriate adaptation measures. The information generated from this article helps the design of early warning systems against droughts and floods.

J	Abbas, SA; Xuan, YQ; Song, XM				Abbas, Salam A.; Xuan, Yunqing; Song, Xiaomeng			Quantile Regression Based Methods for Investigating Rainfall Trends Associated with Flooding and Drought Conditions	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Precipitation; Quantile regression; Trend analysis	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; WATER-RESOURCES; TEMPERATURE; INDEX	Conducting trend analysis of climatic variables is one of the key steps in many climate change impact studies where trend is often checked against aggregated variables. However, there is also a strong need to investigate the trend of the data in different regimes - examples include high flow versus low flow, and heavy precipitation versus prolonged dry period. For this matter, quantile regression (QR) based methods are preferred as they can reveal the temporal dependencies of the variable in question for not only the mean value, but also its quantiles. As such, the tendencies revealed by the QR methods are more informative and helpful in studies where different mitigation methods need to be considered at different severity levels.In this paper, we demonstrate the use of several quantile regressions methods to analyse the long-term trend of rainfall records in two climatically different regions: The Dee River catchment in the United Kingdom, for which daily rainfall data of 1970-2004 are available; and the Beijing Metropolitan Area in China for which monthly rainfall data from 1950 to 2012 are available. Two quantiles are used to represent heavy rainfall condition (0.98 quantile) and severe dry condition (0.02 quantile). The trends of these two quantiles are then estimated using linear quantile regression before being spatially interpolated to demonstrate their spatial distribution (for Dee river only). The method is also compared with traditional indices such as SPI. The results show that the quantile regression method can reveal patterns for both extremely wet and dry conditions of the areas. The clear difference between trends at the chosen quantiles manifests the utility of QR in this context.

The impact of multiple stress conditions on plants was recently termed "multifactorial stress combination" (MFSC) and defined as the occurrence of 3 or more stressors that impact plants simultaneously or sequentially. We recently reported that with the increased number and complexity of different MFSC stressors, the growth and survival of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings declines, even if the level of each individual stress is low enough to have no significant effect on plants. However, whether MFSC would impact commercial crop cultivars is largely unknown. Here, we reveal that a MFSC of 5 different low-level abiotic stresses (salinity, heat, the herbicide paraquat, phosphorus deficiency, and the heavy metal cadmium), applied in an increasing level of complexity, has a significant negative impact on the growth and biomass of a commercial rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar and a maize (Zea mays) hybrid. Proteomics, element content, and mixOmics analyses of MFSC in rice identified proteins that correlate with the impact of MFSC on rice seedlings, and analysis of 42 different rice genotypes subjected to MFSC revealed substantial genetic variability in responses to this unique state of stress combination. Taken together, our findings reveal that the impacts of MFSC on 2 different crop species are severe and that MFSC may substantially affect agricultural productivity.

Bhomra is an example of a closed, poorly maintained horseshoe-shaped floodplain wetland which aggravates its degradation by both climatic and anthropogenic stressors. For the purpose of the present study, historic climate data were collected from the Indian Meteorological Department. The climatic data show increased temperature (Kendall's tau = 0.60, p < 0.05) and decreased rainfall (Kendall's tau = -0.33, p < 0.05) in the studied region over the last two decades. The wetland is dominated by Cypriniformes species, followed by Perciformes. However, recent data of the year 2020 shows that the annual fish production (i.e., 32,155 kg) from the wetland is below the average production of the last 10 years (i.e., 54,704 kg). Though the species diversity was moderate along with the moderate species richness (i.e., Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H-i) = 1.581 +/- 0.007), higher evenness (Simpson evenness index (E-Sim) 0.995 +/- 0.001) was observed throughout the wetland. The wetland is now at a verge of higher attention in recovering its productive potential, which can be achieved through various institution management approaches and stakeholder's participation by keeping the healthy ecosystem.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different soil water content on the nutritional potential of young Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) on the level of phenolics, sugars, photosynthetic pigments and antioxidant capacity. Total phenolic acids were induced in plants grown under drought conditions. Both types of stress increased soluble sugars in Chinese cabbage but reduced total tannins. Plants grown under drought had more L-ascorbic acid than the control group; however, the concentration of ferulic acid and quercetin was reduced. On the other hand, excess of water increased the amount of sinapic and ferulic acid, main hydroxycinnamic acids in Chinese cabbage. Photosynthetic pigments were more susceptible to flooding (reduced amount) than drought, the only exception was chlorophyll b whose concentration was significantly higher in plants grown under drought. In addition, among all the measured parameters, chlorophyll b reacted most specifically against flooding (decreased) and drought (increased). Chinese cabbage grown under flooding had reduced amount of porphyrins compared to the one grown under normal and drought conditions, but showed higher antioxidant capacity (ABTS). Based on the results, the use of excess water could be considered as a possibility when growing young Chinese cabbage since it increased the concentration of antioxidants sinapic and ferulic acid and resulted in higher antioxidant capacity, recorded by ABTS assay, compared to control plants.

Precipitation has increased in the Mississippi River basin generally, increasing runoff, so that in recent years the Mississippi River has been above flood stage for longer periods of time both earlier and later in the year, increasing the likelihood that hurricane surge, traditionally confined to summer and fall, may compound effects of prolonged high water on river levees. The Bonnet Carre Spillway, just upstream of New Orleans has been operated more often and for longer periods of time in recent years than ever before in its nearly 100-year history. Because all rain that falls within the city must be pumped out, residents have been exposed to interior flooding more frequently as high-intensity precipitation events can occur in any season. A sustainable path for New Orleans should involve elevating people and sensitive infrastructure above flood levels, raising some land levels, and creating water storage areas within the city. Management of the lower Mississippi River in the future must include consideration that the river will exceed its design capacity on a regular basis. The river must also be used to restore coastal wetlands through the use of diversions, which will also relieve pressure on levees.	[Day, John W.; Kemp, G.

Improving our understanding about climate extremes can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and extremes. The objective here is to investigate the changes in climate and climate extremes by considering two time slices (i.e., 1962-1990 and 1991-2019) in all climate zones of Pakistan by utilizing observed data from 54 meteorological stations. Different statistical methods and techniques were applied on observed station data to assess changes in temperature, precipitation and spatio-temporal trends of climatic extremes over Pakistan from 1962 to 2019. The Mann-Kendal test demonstrated increasing precipitation (DJF) and decreasing maximum and minimum temperatures (JJA) at the meteorological stations located in the Karakoram region during 1962-1990. The decadal analysis, on the other hand, showed a decrease in precipitation during 1991-2019 and an increase in temperature (maximum and minimum) during 2010-2019, which is consistent with the recently observed slight mass loss of glaciers related to the Karakoram Anomaly. These changes are highly significant at 5% level of significance at most of the stations. In case of temperature extremes, summer days (SU25) increased except in zone 4, TX10p (cold days) decreased across the country during 1962-1990, except for zones 1 and 2. TX90p (warm days) increased between 1991-2019, with the exception of zone 5, and decreased during 1962-1990, with the exception of zones 2 and 5. The spatio-temporal trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a rising tendency from 1991 to 2019, with the exception of zone 4, which showed a decreasing trend. PRCPTOT (annual total wet-day precipitation), R10 (number of heavy precipitation days), R20 (number of very heavy precipitation days), and R25mm (very heavy precipitation days) increased (decreased) considerably in the North Pakistan during 1962-1990 (1991-2019). The findings of this study can help to address some of the sustainable development goals related climate action, hunger and environment. In addition, the findings can help in developing sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies against climate change and extremes. As the climate and extremes conditions are not the uniform in all climate zone, therefore, it is suggested to the formers and agriculture department to harvest crops resilient to the climatic condition of each zone. Temperature has increasing trend in the northern Pakistan, therefore, the concerned stakeholders need to make rational plans for higher river flow/flood situation due to snow and glacier melt.

The increasing trends at the regional level are similar to global trends (-3 & PLUSMN; 0.04 mm/year): between 1.8 mm/year in Alvarado, Veracruz, to 3.6 mm/year in Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo. A synthetic model was applied to Mexican Atlantic coast under two sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100. Our objectives were: 1) to identify potentially floodable zones in the face of a sea level rise of one and two meters on the Mexican Atlantic coast with a synthetic model using SRTM and LiDAR topographic data; 2) to determine vegetation and land use affected in the potentially floodable zones; and 3) quantify the vulnerable human population. With topographic data we identified low areas (one and two meters) to assess potentially floodable zones; these were intersected with data layers of vegetation, land use, and human population. Deltaic zones, coastal lagoons and low-lying areas of the Yucatan Peninsula were regions with the largest potentially floodable surface. In the one-meter sea rise scenario, 581,674 ha were identified as potentially floodable, and 896,151 in the two-meter scenario. The most vulnerable vegetation and land use types were wetlands, such as cattail marshes (tulares;-29 %) and mangroves (-27 %), as well as cultivated grasslands (-6 %). The indirectly affected coastal population could be approximately 5.5 million in these scenarios (-33 %), and the directly affected population could range between 124,000 and 440,000 (-0.72 and 2.55 %, respectively). These results indicate that there will be strong effects in economic, social, and environmental impacts on the Atlantic coast of Mexico in the event of a one- and twometers sea level rise. This type of work will enable proposal conservation and adaptation strategies for human populations and coastal cities.

The meteorological observations in the Indian Himalayan region (IHR), notably in glacierized catchments, are scarce. Therefore, the present study aims to demonstrate a comprehensive investigation of meteorological parameters (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, radiation fluxes, albedo, and pressures) over the Dokriani Glacier catchment (DGC) using time-series data (2011-2016) obtained from a network of three automatic weather stations (AWSs). The study also provides new insights into characteristics of meteorological variables at inter- and intra-seasonal scales (winter: December-February, Pre-monsoon: March-May, Monsoon: June-September, and Post-monsoon: October-November). The results show that the albedo and outflux radiation decreases rapidly with the onset of monsoon season, while there is an increase of relative humidity (RH) and positive degree-days (PDDs). The positive temperature (> 2celcius) at higher elevations (> 5500 m) raise serious concerns about the summer accumulation characteristics of the Dokriani glacier. The DGC has an average near-surface temperature lapse rate (NSTLR) of 6.0 degrees C km(-1), higher in the pre-monsoon and lower during the monsoon. The wind speed and albedo are more sensitive during winter and pre-monsoon seasons. The air temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity exhibit significant seasonal fluctuation, whereas other meteorological variables have a nearly comparable seasonal pattern. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) significantly influences all climatic factors. This may be utilized to examine the Dokriani glacier's mass budget and melt rate with other dependent factors, such as glacier hypsometry, orientation, surface velocity, and the extent of debris-cover. Furthermore, the dataset of this study may be correlated with hydro-meteorological observations in various regions of the Himalaya and deciphered using a regional climate dataset; for example, the Kedarnath tragedy-2013 and the most recent flash flood that occurred in Raunthi valley, Tapovan on February 07, 2021.

J	Nguyen, TL; Asahi, C; Tran, TA; Le, NH				Nguyen, Thuy Linh; Asahi, Chisato; Tran, Thi An; Le, Ngoc Hanh			Indicator-based approach for flood vulnerability assessment in ancient heritage city of Hoi An, Central Region of Vietnam	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood vulnerability index; Indicator-based approach; Cultural heritage area; GIS; Analytic hierarchy process; Vietnam	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDEX; ADAPTATION; DECISION; HAZARD	The increasing unpredictable floods due to the effect of climate change across regions of Vietnam have threaten the country's socio-economic development goals at local, regional and national scales. This paper employs indicator-based approach to calculate Flood Vulnerability Index and generates vulnerability maps that reflect the spatial distribution of flood vulnerability in the Central region of Vietnam, which is the hardest hit flood region and home to many sites of great cultural-historical value. Data were collected from Hoi An's 2020 statistical yearbook, digital elevation model, land use map, open street map and from surveying experts and civil servants at the city level (representatives of the City People's Committee, the Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation of Hoi An) and at ward/commune level (representatives of 12 wards and communes). GIS techniques and analytical hierarchy process were applied to analysis the obtained data and generate three scenarios that reflect the impact of vulnerability's components. The findings indicate that number of organizations in disaster prevention and historical site preservation, road density, the presence of historical sites, flood frequency and average elevation are the key factors affecting the city's vulnerability to flood hazard in the area of cultural heritage. The empirical results in Hoi An also indicate the importance of the number of poor households as an necessary factor when considering the sensitivity to flood in developing countries. In addition, this study distinguishes the impact of vulnerability's components by generating different scenarios which clearly proof that having more floods does not always mean high vulnerability and vice versa. More importantly, by looking into the reasons (either transportation, education or other indicators) that leads to the gap between Flood Vulnerability Index in different scenarios, the paper subsequently identifies measures for each locality, whereby the governmental investment budget can be prioritized effectively.

J	Rayan, M; Gruehn, D; Khayyam, U				Rayan, Muhammad; Gruehn, Dietwald; Khayyam, Umer			Frameworks for Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) Indicators: Expert and Community Outlook toward Green Climate-Resilient Cities in Pakistan	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable urban green indicators; urban green space (UGS); climate change; adaptation; participatory planning (PP) approach; Pakistan	URBANIZATION; WALKING; ROOFS; TOOL	Climate-induced pressures spur on the need for urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning. This approach offers a possible way to improve ecosystem functionality and human well-being in adversely affected urban regions, wherein UGI is perceived as a green and nature-based climate change mitigation/adaptation strategy. In Pakistan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province lacks such urban landscape and greening policies (ULGP) or legislative frameworks for transitioning to green action plans (GAP), to alleviate the risk of multi-climatic hazards. Thus, this study aims to investigate a sustainable UGI-indicator-based framework model, based on the due inclusion of the concerned stakeholders. The relative importance index (RII) and inter-quartile range (IQR) techniques are employed for field data analysis. The findings proclaim excellent reliability (alpha > 0.7) and internal consistency, wherein sustainable UGI indicators are grouped based on their importance. The results portray the ecological and economic sustainability dimensions as being important (RII = 0.835 and RII = 0.807, respectively), socio-cultural dimensions as being moderately important (RII = 0.795), and a set of UGS elements (RII >= 0.77) as vital for bolstering individual UGI indicators. The main UGS elements emerging in each category can be grouped as follows: ecological category-"reducing rainwater runoff" (RII = 0.94); socio-cultural category-"enhancement of mental and physical health" (RII = 0.90); and eco category-"minimizing the risk of flood disasters" (RII = 0.96). The simulation results demonstrate the need for an inclusive perspective when building the urban green space (UGS) infrastructure (and standards) that will be most suitable for ensuring climate-resilient urban regions. This study contributes to putting the scientific research knowledge of the natural green-landscape-based (NBLB) approach into practice. The study calls for the establishment of an effective, pragmatic relationship between the urban landscape and greening policies, alongside a constructive relationship with the native inhabitants to ensure eco-friendly and resilient settlements.

Previous researches have shown a gradually degrading capacity of traditional hard engineering structures (e.g., seawall, dikes) on flood mitigation due to problems such as land subsidence and insufficient maintenance. To remedy the defects, the "building with nature concept" for coastal protection with saltmarshes was examined by combining field measurements and numerical simulations. The advantages of saltmarsh over traditional seawall on flood protection was demonstrated from the perspective of both flood area mitigation and economic gain, based on scenario simulations. Results show that tidal wetlands are essential in mitigating significant wave heights (H-s) and current velocities even during storm conditions. The storm wave and current velocity reduction ratio (RRw and RRc) by saltmarshes on Chongming Dongtan Shoal (CMDS) during Typhoon 9711 is approximately 11% and 51%, respectively. The wave and current mitigation by Scirpus mariqueter are more efficient than Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis during measurements in 2010, which were approximately 0.3 m and 0.2 m/s, 0.125 m and 0.155 m/s, 0.086 m and 0.128 m/s per kilometer width, respectively. The summer saltmarsh area 54.2 km(2) on CMDS protects approximately 32 km(2) land area behind the seawall from being flooded, equivalent to the seawall heightening of approximately 0.42 m on equivalent flood mitigation. The performance of cost-and-benefit analysis shows a relatively higher (by 3%-7%) net present value (NPV) and a higher (by 1.5 times) benefit-cost ratio (BC) of nature-based solution (i.e., saltmarsh restoration) compared with traditional hard engineering solution (i.e., seawall construction). Thus, building seawall with nature, such as a hybrid flood protection measure, should be implemented in the future coastal redesign and maintenance.

However, the evolutionary outcomes of those mechanisms are complex and difficult to discriminate. Here, we test how alternative drivers affected connectivity along the Amazonian floodplains generating current patterns of population structure and diversity within the Striped Woodcreeper, a widespread bird species tied to forests seasonally flooded by Amazonian rivers. Location Amazonian floodplains. Taxon Xiphorhynchus obsoletus (Aves, Furnariidae). Methods We sequenced 2213 loci of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and 20 exons to investigate patterns of genetic structure and connectivity across the Striped Woodcreeper distribution, using a set of spatially explicit methods. Population genetics statistics were calculated for each sampled drainage and within each identified cluster. We tested alternative evolutionary scenarios and estimated past and current demographic parameters implementing a simulation-based framework. Results Three genetic clusters with high admixture proportions were identified. These clusters are distributed in the western, central and eastern parts of the Amazon Basin and are not correlated with different river water types representing ecological gradients along the floodplains. Instead, migration rates indicate two putative historical barriers along the main channel of the Amazonas-Solimoes River. Demographic model tests suggest a process of sequential differentiation, partitioned across the Amazon Basin, with stable population sizes and continuous gene flow. Main conclusion Our results support the hypothesis that late Quaternary changes in connectivity between the eastern and western Amazonian drainages were responsible for driving genetic differentiation in the Striped Woodcreeper. Genomic differentiation occurred in the presence of long-term gene flow throughout the X. obsoletus distribution, suggesting some degree of continuous historical connectivity across Amazonian floodplains. Compared to previous studies, our results suggest that although connectivity among populations of Amazonian bird species specialized in floodplain habitats varies in response to the same abiotic mechanisms, species-specific differences in habitat use may be a strong predictor of population divergence.

Abiotic Stress Tolerance-Progress and Pathways of Sustainable Rice Production	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						food security; rice; abiotic stresses; stress tolerant rice varieties; strategic planning	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS; HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRESS; SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; HEAT TOLERANCE; SALT TOLERANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; SALINITY TOLERANCE	Rice is globally a major food crop and its production has progressively been affected by various types of abiotic stresses especially drought, flooding, salinity, heat and cold in most of the cultivable rice ecosystems. The incidence, intensity and duration of these stresses are anticipated to aggravate due to climate change consequences, demanding resilient yields in these situations to be essential. Present paper deals with reviewing various types of abiotic stresses and their mitigation strategies for enhancing and stabilizing rice production in stress prone areas. Review of available literature pertaining to the study area has been used as research methodology for this paper. The available literature suggests that stress-tolerant varieties can serve as the most viable strategy to contribute in coping with the problem of abiotic stresses. Although, good progress has been made in the development of stress-tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) and incessant efforts are being made to spread these varieties in target areas, adoption by farmers is yet to meet expectations. Advantage, affordability, awareness and availability are the main factors responsible for adopting of any technology. The adoption of stress-tolerant varieties has not reached its potential, predominantly due to the lack of awareness and non-availability of seeds amongst farmers. Strategic and intentional collaborations should be ensured for scaling the sustainable delivery and diffusion of STRVs. A promotional roadmap that ensures the linkages between private and public seed sectors remains the key factor for its successful adoption. Similarly, strengthening of formal, informal and semi-formal seed systems is crucial to accelerate the dissemination of these varieties. There is an imperative need to create strategic plans for the development of varieties possessing multiple stress tolerance. Significant investments for sustainability of rice production in stress prone areas form the essential component of long-term agricultural development. The sooner these investments and strategies are accomplished, the greater the gains are expected.

The present study investigated the 40-year (1970-2010) spatio-temporal variability in the discharge of the Krishna and Koyna River channels at Karad and Varunji gauging stations. Mean annual discharge (MAQ), mean decadal discharge (MDQ), standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and variance (R-2) were calculated from the daily discharge data to know the spatio-temporal variability. Possible causes of discharge variability were investigated from rainfall, topography, drainage, and reservoir data. Rainfall data (1998-2000) were collected from the Indian meteorological department and satellite-derived tropical rainfall measuring mission to examine the hydrologic response to discharge. Similarly, shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model data were incorporated into ArcGIS software to generate relief, slope, drainage, reservoir, and basin data to quantify their relative influence with discharge. Results explored whether a significant variability existed in the 40-year historical discharge in the Krishna and Koyna River channels. Low MAQ for both the channels was recorded during 2000-2001, while it was maximum during 2006-2007. Krishna River's MDQ was higher as compared to Koyna River. The highest SD value (2358.4 m(3)/s) was recorded for 2000-2010 and minimum (416.5 m(3)/s) for the 1970-1980 decade. The CV of the Varunji station was lower in 1970-1980 (0.2) while higher in 2000-2010 (0.7) with a rising trend from 1970-1980 to 2000-2010 decade. The Krishna and Koyna River flow regime has changed over the four decades due to variations in rainfall, relief, slope, drainage, reservoir, and basin area within both the basins. The results could be useful to the regional climate and flood forecasting centres not only in the Krishna and Koyna river basin, but also in other basins which have similar hydrogeological characteristics.

Projected Changes to Extreme Runoff and Precipitation Events From a Downscaled Simulation Over the Western United States	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; extreme events; precipitation; runoff; downscaling	CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS; WINTER PRECIPITATION; 21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE; WATER-RESOURCES; BIAS CORRECTION; FLOOD RISK; MODEL; CALIFORNIA; CMIP5; TRENDS	Extreme precipitation and runoff events, which often impact natural and social systems more than mean changes, generally occur over regional scales. Future climate projections can be used to estimate how the hydrologic cycle may change, but the coarse resolution of global climate models (GCMs) (>1 degrees) makes it difficult to evaluate regional changes, such as over a single watershed. To estimate changes in hydroclimatic variables at finer spatial resolutions, we dynamically downscale the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model over the western United States at 9 km spatial resolution. By running WRF at a higher spatial resolution, we estimate future climate conditions, including 99% event magnitude, over 17 watersheds: the Columbia, Lower Colorado, Upper Colorado, the Upper Missouri/Yellowstone, and 12 basins draining the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California. Over each basin, we compare a historical period (1996-2005) with mid-century (2041-2050) and end-century (2091-2100). From the WRF/CCSM simulations, most basins are projected to have earlier peaks in springtime streamflow. The Columbia and the Lower Colorado watersheds are both expected to experience more extreme wet days, with the 99th percentile of daily precipitation estimated to increase by over 10%. For the Upper Colorado, however, the 99th percentile of daily runoff is projected to decrease by over 30%. Basins in the northern and central Sierra Nevada are projected to have substantial increases in extreme runoff, with doubling of high flow event magnitude possible for some basins. By end-century, the contribution of high-magnitude runoff (>90th percentile) to total runoff is projected to increase from 46 to 56%, when averaged across all 12 Sierra Nevada basins. Though only one realization from a single GCM, the downscaled simulation presented here shows interesting results regarding how extreme events may change; these results can be tested by downscaling other global models with WRF to create an ensemble of dynamically downscaled future projections.

Significantly P. echinata showed measurably different growth patterns related to the environment where wild and cultivated trees have grown. Paubrasilia echinata once grew so abundantly along the tropical coast of South America that the names given to the tree by early Europeans colonists-Bresil, Brasil, Brazil-became synonymous with an entire geography. Today, despite restoration and protection efforts, the species remains under threat of extinction throughout Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Considering the past overexploitation and ongoing climate changes, the future of P. echinata significantly depends upon human understanding of the species' growth dynamics and growth-climate relations. Therefore, this work aims to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of calendar dating P. echinata tree rings; (2) build chronologies by analyzing its growth rings; and (3) establish with detail the specific influence of climate on annual radial xylem production. Differences in vessel and axial parenchyma frequency, local distended rays and marginal parenchyma were the wood anatomical markers used to distinguish boundaries between adjacent rings so that dendrochronological methods could be applied. For climate-growth responses, we developed tree-ring width chronologies from wild and cultivated trees. Results revealed that seasonal rainfall is the most important factor influencing P. echinata growth. More specifically, positive correlation was observed between the tree-ring chronology of wild trees and precipitation during the rainy months of the growing season, while the tree-ring chronology of cultivated trees correlated negatively with precipitation in months before the growth period. Wild trees showed increment growth rates lower than planted trees. Rainfall's observed effect on P. echinata is, of course, not surprising. However, our results contribute a detailed quantitative record of that effect, which expands the body of ecological knowledge regarding P. echinata necessary for ongoing conservation efforts under current and future human-caused climate change.

Investigating changes in the frequency and intensity of such events is essential for climate risk management. Here, this study thoroughly analysed CEWD features in China from 1980 to 2020 using the daily observation dataset. We also evaluated and compared the ability of two widely used precipitation products, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation version 2 (MSWEP), to detect CEWD features. According to the observation data, the frequency and intensity of CEWD events are related to local climate and present "high eastern and low western " spatial patterns across China. Since 1980, more than half of China's mainland has experienced increases in both the frequency and intensity of CEWDs. Some stations detected decreasing trends in CEWD frequency and amounts, which are primarily located in the eastern coastal regions and southwest of warm temperate humid/subhumid regions. The ERA5 precipitation product generally outperforms MSWEP data in detecting CEWD events, and the latter significantly underestimates the annual frequency and amounts of CEWDs. These findings provide basic and valuable information regarding CEWD features across China and where such studies can be conducted based on precipitation datasets. Furthermore, these findings will also aid policymakers in managing extreme precipitation-related natural hazards.

A Pilot Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global environmental change; medical devices; human health; animal health; survey	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALLERGIC RHINITIS	Globalization and urbanization are new challenges for the ability to protect public health. Indeed, the anthropogenic impact is changing the environment on a global scale. These changes can have direct and indirect health effects on both human and animal populations, introducing new diseases. Heat waves and floods are an example of these changes. Global Environmental Change (GEC) consequences on human health and well-being are stronger in urban areas, which are inhabited by 70% of the European population. In this context, the use of appropriate medical devices can also help mitigate the effects of climate change. Studies into lifestyle, environment quality and potential fields of application can be useful tools to identify possible types of medical device that could help to support the therapeutic needs and the prevention of health both in everyday life, and in the case of environmental alerts. A study was carried out on the potential role of medical devices (MDs) in mitigating the effects of GEC on human and animal health, by issuing two different questionnaires to specific professional clusters: the first to doctors, pharmacists, and veterinarians, the second to MD manufacturers. The data obtained from this study confirm the strong connection between GEC and the increase in the use of some MDs. Results obtained from questionnaires circulated to MD manufacturers confirmed this trend. MD manufacturers also declared that there are no longer any seasonal trends in market demand for some medical devices. This is a pilot study to consider MDs as a mitigation tool for CEGs.

J	Yang, HM; Zhao, SW; Kim, C				Yang, Huimin; Zhao, Shuwen; Kim, Chulsoo			Analysis of floating city design solutions in the context of carbon neutrality-focus on Busan Oceanix City	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Green Energy Technologies (ICGET)	JUL 28-30, 2022	Univ Appl Sci, ELECTR NETWORK		Univ Appl Sci	Carbon neutrality; Floating urban; Oceanix City; Urban design		Excessive carbon emissions are causing global climate change, leading to higher temperatures and continued sea level rise, affecting all the world's seaside cities. Concentrated population migration to large cities, flooding and rising sea levels are limiting the spatial growth potential of coastal urban water bodies. In response to climate change, the city of Busan, where sea levels are set to rise by 70.6 cm by 2100, is actively promoting the development of marine cities, and the development of marine space has become a hotspot. In response, the United Nations has proposed the world's first floating city design scheme, Oceanix City. The aim of this thesis is to build a new type of carbon neutral floating city, by reviewing existing research papers on floating cities and carbon neutrality, analyzing in depth the carbon neutral design elements of the scheme, exploring the possibility of creating a zero carbon zone in the ocean and finally proposing alternative energy sources and design methods for marine cities. Using a case study approach, this thesis analyses carbon sequestration and carbon emissions, providing a theoretical basis for the design of future carbon-neutral floating cities with positive implications for achieving carbon neutrality. The study also proposes macro design criteria for a carbon neutral vision for floating cities, providing a theoretical basis and reference for the development of future floating cities.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

This phenomenon is more prominent in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and such islands are already facing escalating associated environmental threats, causing social and economic disruptions as well as insecurities. Amongst the SIDS, the coastal areas of Mauritius are considered among the most vulnerable to SLR, where statistics showed that between the years 1987 and 2007, an annual increase of 2.1 mm in the sea level has been observed around Mauritius. Although SLR has various associated impacts, limited work has been undertaken to assess the coastal vulnerability of the impacts of SLR for Mauritius and to compute the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) of the island. Taking cognizance of this limitation, the purpose of this paper is to quantify, prioritize and critically assess the vulnerability of key impacts of sea level rise on the coastal areas of Mauritius following computation of a CVI. In this process, five key research questions are answered towards calculating the CVI of the island to eventually conceptualize a framework with the aim to reduce the adverse impacts of SLR on coastal zones of Mauritius. Findings of this study aim at the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability of coastal areas to the impacts of SLR.

In addition to the ability to reduce nonpoint source (NPS) pollution caused by flash floods from the surface runoff, LID has also been applied to control water quantity under extreme rainfall events. Due to the fact that studies about LID configuration optimization tended to control water quantity and gradually ignored the main functions of water quality treatment, this study aims to consider water quantity and quality to estimate the benefits and optimal configuration of LID by Non-Dominated Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). In addition, regarding to the outlet peak flow, hydrologic footprint residence (HFR) was considered to be the water quantity indicator due to the ability to represent the dynamics of flow changes, and the modified quality indicator (Mass Emission First Flush ratio, MEFF30) was corrected to represent the pollutant transport process in a large catchment area. The results show that the flood and MEFF30 reduction rate of LID are inversely proportional to rainfall duration and intensity. The benefit of pollutant reduction, which can still be maintained by 20% and 15% under a big return period and the long duration was about three times than the quantity control. Taking the cost into account, although the rain barrel had the best effect of reduction per unit area, green roofs and permeable pavements had a higher unit cost reduction rate due to the lower costs. The upper and middle reaches of the open channel and the confluence of rainwater sewers should be the optimal LID configuration to achieve the benefits of both flood and pollution reduction.

In this context, the scientific literature is characterized by a relevant number of studies trying to identify the convective component of precipitation, since this kind of phenomena, due to their short duration and high intensity, may lead to an increased risk of flash floods or debris flows and, consequently, human life losses and economic damages. In this study, a separation between the convective and stratiform precipitation, starting from the subhourly precipitation time series recorded over Sicily (Italy), is provided on a monthly scale. Results show that the percentage of convective precipitation increases as the associated intensity increases, following what is generally known about convective events. Moreover, during the summer months, higher percentages of convective rainfall are generally reached for lower values of intensity, since this season favours the occurrence of these phenomena due to high temperature and relative humidity. In addition to the regional analysis, even an at-site analysis has been carried out, through the definition of a critical intensity threshold to identify the predominant convective component for each rain gauge. This analysis has pointed out that such convective events have occurred mainly in the east part of the island mainly due to the complex orography of this area, which favours the occurrence not only of such phenomena but of flash floods and debris flows as well.

Hydrological interventions have the potential to alter vegetated habitats in coastal nearshore ecosystems, but little is known about the impacts on organic carbon (C-org) sequestration, which plays an important role in climate change mitigation. We examined the effects of past human interventions through artificial inlet opening in a lagoonal seagrass meadow. The sediment profiles of geological and biogeochemical characteristics were measured to obtain the historical changes in the lagoon environment and C-org accumulation rates. Isotopic and elemental signatures and diatom assemblages showed that the interventions increased the duration of seawater exchanges and the extent of the seagrass meadow. C-org accumulation rates increased more than 1.9-fold after the intervention, resulting in additional C-org storage in the seagrass meadow during last 64 years. Synthesis and applications. Artificial opening of tidal inlet can potentially provide unintended ecological benefits, such as increased carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. Hydrological interventions could be undertaken intentionally as a potential active intervention to sequester carbon, as well as control flood risk and provide other benefits to people in estuarine systems. Our results illustrate that physical factors such as improving salinity conditions and mineral particle supply have an impact on the feasibility of hydrological interventions for enhancing carbon sequestration. We propose that biogeochemical-physical coupled approach will help stakeholders to evaluate the ecological and social risks and synergies of implementing hydrological interventions.

In this study, we adopt historical daily precipitation from rainfall estimates on a gridded network (REGEN) and future daily projections from 10 general circulation models (GCMs) to analyze the potential risks of extreme precipitation due to changes in the magnitude and frequency. We calculate the 10-year and 100-year return levels by fitting the partial duration series (PDS) data with the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. The potential risks are quantified in two terms: by the ratio of the magnitude to the threshold and by the exceedance frequency comparing to the theoretical value. The results show that in the future, about 46% of the world may suffer from mid or high risk of change in extreme precipitation. Most regions show higher risk due to the increased frequency of extreme precipitation events under the RCP8.5 scenario. The high risk of humid regions mainly appears under the RCP8.5 scenario and is mainly driven by frequency change, while that of arid regions appears under both the scenarios and is driven by both the frequency and magnitude change. The tropical rainforest climate areas of South America (SA (N)), the tropical savanna or tropical wet monsoon and tropical dry areas of South Asia (SA), and the subarctic climate areas of Northern Asia (NOA) may suffer more risks from the view of both magnitude and frequency changes of extreme precipitation.

We conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the impacts of different rain regimes and land management on litter mass loss and earthworm ecological groups (epigeic, endogeic and anecic) across European agroecosystems. We also tested if the effects of different rainfall regimes (normal, drought, flooding, intermittent) on earthworm functional diversity (FD) or community-weighted mean (CWM) of earthworm ecological groups (particularly anecic species in the case of CWM), affected litter mass loss across land-use types. We found that drought was the main factor retarding litter mass loss across European agroecosystems irrespective of management type. The effects of the rain regime on litter mass loss were coupled with the pedoclimatic conditions that were different among the studied European land-use types. Across land-use types the importance of earthworm communities for litter decomposition was higher under water depletion. These results also suggest that FD, as a proxy of niche complementarity, is crucial for the stability of the decomposition process under environmental disturbances. The FD values under drought regimes strongly indicated that climatic changes may slow down litter decomposition as a result of FD alterations that could compromise the long-term maintenance of litter mass loss. This result may be especially relevant for the European soils that are already under hydric stress, such as in most Mediterranean agroecosystems.

As the main source of water for the region, this river is crucial to both the natural environment and the socio-economic development. To extend the discharge record and better understand past and future changes in Naryn River discharge, we developed four tree-ring width chronologies and analyzed the relationship between tree growth and discharge. The resulting reconstruction dates back to 1753 and has an R-2 of 0.374 (1939-2017). Interannual discharge variations of the Naryn River indicate that 1917 was the driest year of the past 265 years, while 1956 was the wettest. The record also indicates that the majority of extreme flood years occurred in the past century; prior to about 1900 C.E., the discharge of the Naryn River was relatively stable. Since 1900 C.E., discharge volume has gradually increased, as has discharge variability. At decadal time scales, the 2010s are notable for the frequency of major floods, whereas the 1910s were the driest. Between the 1870s and the 1910s, the Naryn River experienced a period of low discharge that continued for nearly half a century. The discharge of the Naryn River over the past 265 years appears to vary over quasi-periods of 60, 21, 11, and 2-4 years, which are driven by large-scale climate systems.

We developed an extended version of QM to improve the quality of bias-corrected extreme precipitation events. The extended version aims to exploit the advantages of both non-parametric methods and extreme value theory. We evaluated QM by applying it to a small ensemble of hindcast simulations, performed with RCMs at six different locations in Europe. We examined the quality of both raw and bias-corrected simulations of precipitation extremes using the split sample and cross-validation approaches. The split-sample approach mimics the application to future climate scenarios, while the cross-validation framework is designed to analyse "new extremes", that is, events beyond the range of calibration of QM. We demonstrate that QM generally improves the simulation of precipitation extremes, compared to raw RCM results, but still tends to present unstable behaviour at higher quantiles. This instability can be avoided by carefully imposing constraints on the estimation of the distribution of extremes. The extended version of the bias-correction method greatly improves the simulation of precipitation extremes in all cases evaluated here. In particular, extremes in the classical sense and new extremes are both improved. The proposed approach is shown to provide a better representation of the climate change signal and can thus be expected to improve extreme event response for cases such as floods in bias-corrected simulations, a development of importance in various climate change impact assessments. Our results are encouraging for the use of QM for RCM precipitation post-processing in impact studies where extremes are of relevance.

J	Roder, G; Hudson, P; Tarolli, P				Roder, Giulia; Hudson, Paul; Tarolli, Paolo			Flood risk perceptions and the willingness to pay for flood insurance in the Veneto region of Italy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood risk; Risk perception; Preparedness; Willingness to pay; Italy	LANDSLIDE RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION; PREPAREDNESS; IMPACT; VULNERABILITY; DETERMINANTS; ADAPTATION; EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT	The floodplain of the Veneto region (north-east Italy) is one of the most inhabited and economically competitive urban landscapes in Europe. Moreover, recent flood events have caused millions of Euros in damage across the region. Due to the combined influence of climate change and socio-economic development, flood impacts are expected to grow. Therefore, it is important for all flood-prone individuals to actively manage and limit flood risk through property-level flood risk management as part of an integrated flood risk management strategy. This is in line with the calls for wider community engagement in risk management in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, an online-survey of Veneto region residents was conducted asking questions regarding flood risk perceptions, preparedness, and preferences towards flood insurance via self-stated willingness to pay (WTP). Our analysis provides an initial indication that while flood risk knowledge is high, it may not be sufficient to encourage proactive risk management. From the WTP values provided people seem reluctant to buy insurance. However, many respondents expressed that a compulsory insurance system may be acceptable. In such a scheme the estimated insurance premium could fall to between (sic)26 and (sic)42 per year, as compared to, potentially, (sic)800 under risk-based premiums, which falls within the majority of WTP estimates provided ((sic)0-(sic)250). Overall, we identify areas of future research that are critical for the better design of risk management policies, supporting the insurance companies in risk management and for recommendations regarding property-level risk management.

Carbon sequestration in riparian forests: A global synthesis and meta-analysis	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						carbon accounting; carbon credits; climate change; floodplain; multiple benefits; payment for ecosystem services; riparian restoration	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL; RESTORATION; RIVER; FLOODPLAIN; VEGETATION; AFFORESTATION; DEFORESTATION; TERRESTRIAL	Restoration of deforested and degraded landscapes is a globally recognized strategy to sequester carbon, improve ecological integrity, conserve biodiversity, and provide additional benefits to human health and well-being. Investment in riparian forest restoration has received relatively little attention, in part due to their relatively small spatial extent. Yet, riparian forest restoration may be a particularly valuable strategy because riparian forests have the potential for rapid carbon sequestration, are hotspots of biodiversity, and provide numerous valuable ecosystem services. To inform this strategy, we conducted a global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that riparian forests hold on average 68-158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity, with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term ecosystem service returns.

Phylogeographic studies have failed to recover synchronous demographic responses across taxa, although recent evidence supports the interaction between rivers and climate in promoting speciation. Most studies, however, are biased toward upland forest organisms, while other habitats are poorly explored and could hold valuable information about major historical processes. We conducted a comparative phylogenomic analysis of floodplain forest birds to explore the effects of historical environmental changes and current connectivity on population differentiation. Our findings support a similar demographic history among species complexes, indicating that the central portion of the Amazon River basin is a suture zone for taxa isolated across the main Amazonian sub-basins. Our results also suggest that changes in the fluvial landscape induced by climate variation during the Mid- and Late Pleistocene drove population isolation, leading to diversification with subsequent secondary contact.

This article investigates how these synergies facilitate policy change. Drawing on qualitative information from the literature, focus group discussions, and interviews, the article argues that there are confrontational but complementary effects between them, which evolve towards adaptive co-management. Collaborative learning between local governments and farmers enables shared understanding of water management drawbacks, leading to policy change. The article recommends that more attention be given to this approach to guide strategic water policy development in the region.

Urbanization without resilient and sustainable planning and execution could lead to undesirable changes in landscapes and stormwater regulation capacity. These changes have exacerbated the effects of extreme climatic events with disastrous consequences in many cities worldwide. Unfortunately, the major storm in Zhengzhou, China on 20 July 2021 was one of these examples. This event provided a rare opportunity to study the key roles of green infrastructures (GI) in mitigating flooding risks in a major urban center after a devasting flood event. Using the data from high-resolution images collected via two satellites, a comprehensive study of the Jialu System in Greater Zhengzhou was conducted to systematically compare how far the river water had reached before and after the 20 July 2021 major storm in order to identify the main weak links in the city's GI and stormwater management system. A flood inundation intensity index (FI) in the Upper (UJLR), Middle (MJLR), and Lower (LJLR) Regions of the Jialu River System was generated. Bivariate Moran's I, a correlation coefficient between FI and landscape characteristics, was calculated and used to identify problem areas for future improvements. Our results showed that the MJLR had the severest flooding impacts. LJLR had the biggest change in how far the river water reached after flooding, ranging from 4.59 m to 706.28 m. In UJLR, the percentages of mine, crop land, and green space had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. In MJLR, the percentages of vacant land, impervious surfaces, and water body had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. In LJLR, the percentages of vacant land, water body, and crop land had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. The total percentages of both high landscape characteristics indices-high flood inundation intensity indices and low landscape characteristics indices-high flood inundation intensity indices areas are 12.96%, 13.47%, and 13.80% in UJLR, MJLR, and LJLR, respectively. These land cover composition types identified for each region can be treated as areas of primary focus. However, GeoDector Model (GDM) analyses showed that our eight variables of landscape characteristics were not independent. Hence, a more comprehensive approach integrating all eight variables is still necessary in future flood mitigation efforts.

Study focus: Changes in streamflow due to climate change and human activities are highly uncertain. An improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model equipped with a dynamic CO2 input method was used to quantify the environmental change impacts on streamflow in the HRB. Streamflow changes were analyzed based on 22 bias-corrected CMIP6 GCMs under SSP12.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 during two 30-year periods of the middle (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100) of the 21st century relative to the historical period (1971-2000). New hydrological insights for the region: Long-term simulations of annual streamflow in the HRB demonstrated substantial discrepancies between the dynamic and constant CO2 input methods under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, which highlighted the importance of using the dynamic CO2 input method for streamflow simulations. Spatio-temporal analysis using the improved SWAT model revealed that streamflow generally increased under four emission scenarios compared to the historical period. In the HRB, annual streamflow in the downstream plains was higher than in the upstream mountains, and this was more evident under the highest emission scenario of SSP5-8.5. Monthly streamflow showed considerable intra-annual variability that was generally greater from July to November. The strongest increment in streamflow was projected in the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, indicating that flood risk would possibly increase in the late 21st century.

J	Elbra, A				Elbra, Ainsley			The AGM as a site of contestation: evaluating the tactics of environmental shareholder activists	NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article; Early Access						ESG shareholder activism; anti-corporate politics; social movements; climate change; environmental politics	SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS	The politics of climate change in Australia remains highly fraught, this is despite the country experiencing acute impacts of a changing climate including mega-fires, floods, and severe and prolonged drought. Government inaction has led to limited market signals encouraging producers or consumers to move away from carbon intensive energy production to clean energy. In the absence of regulation, Australian shareholder activists are engaging directly with company boards and executives to reform corporate behaviour. This engagement, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) shareholder activism, has proliferated since 2017, much later than in comparable jurisdictions. Activists have targeted the mining, oil and gas, and finance sectors, due to their contribution to the Australian economy and their direct impact on global emissions. This paper explores the reasons for, and the implications of, the growth in ESG shareholder activism in Australia. It argues that the emergence of this activism in Australia was delayed due to complexities in the country's corporations' law. Regulatory attempts at stymying ESG shareholder activism resulted in the emergence of a duopoly of actors, at the cost of broader investor and civil society engagement. It is concluded that the rise of ESG shareholder activism in Australia is linked to growing tension between societal expectations, regulation, and the behaviour of firms. And, that ESG activists have been successful in leveraging this tension. There is evidence that large corporates have responded to activist claims, rendering this form of activism a potentially effective method for addressing some of the most pressing issues facing society.

Effect of different macrophytes on crop cultivation under floating agriculture system for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						Waterlogging; Soilless culture; Floating bed; Mulching materials; Tomato	WETLANDS; GROWTH	The adverse effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and frequent floods, pose significant challenges to agricultural systems, particularly in low-lying countries like Bangladesh. To address these challenges, floating agriculture systems have emerged as a climate-resilient alternative for crop cultivation. Floating agriculture is a traditional agricultural system where aquatic free-floating macrophytes are used as the medium for the growth of plants. This cultivation system is traditionally used for seedling development in the south and south-western regions (Barishal, Pirojpur, and Gopalganj) of Bangladesh. However, very little scientific attention has been given to using macrophytes in crop production and preparing floating beds. Therefore, the present investigation has been carried out to select suitable macrophytes for preparing a floating bed by assaying the condition of the floating bed and the morphological and yield-related factors of cultivated crops during the Robi season in 2021. Five different macrophytes, namely, Salvinia molesta, Pistia stratiotes, Lemna minor, Salvinia cucullate, and Azolla pinnata, have been used as mulching material, which has been conducted in a Completely Randomized Block Design (RCBD). The plant material BARI tomato-14 has been transplanted on the floating beds to assess the effect of macrophytes on crop production. The results of the present investigation reveal that different macrophytes have distinct effects on tomato plants' growth and yield-related parameters in floating agriculture systems. Salvinia cucullata shows a better response in the stability of the floating bed, whereas Salvinia molesta exhibits better responses as mulching material on yield-related parameters of cultivated crops.

J	Xu, WT; Xiong, LH; Yan, L; Dong, LY; Jiang, C; Xu, CY				Xu, Wentao; Xiong, Lihua; Yan, Lei; Dong, Linyao; Jiang, Cong; Xu, Chong-Yu			Estimating the scale parameter of the norming constants method in analysing nonstationary annual maximum floods	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						climate change; nonstationary flood frequency analysis; norming constants method; physical covariates	HYDROLOGIC DESIGN METHODS; FLOW-DURATION CURVES; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTION; NON-STATIONARITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RETURN PERIOD; RIVER-BASIN; RISK; STREAMFLOW	In frequency analysis of annual maximum flood series (AMFS), it is mechanism-based and significant to incorporate the information of the underlying "ordinary" daily streamflow events for improving accuracy of flood risk estimation and appropriate management. In previous studies related to flood nonstationarity, the classical norming constants method (C-NCM) has been used to derive statistical parameters of annual maximum flood distribution from daily streamflow distribution. However, C-NCM does not flexibly consider the feasible range of the scale parameter of annual maximum flood distributions, which can result in the inability to provide sufficient and reliable models to fit AMFS. This paper aims to investigate the potential of two alternative norming constants methods in fitting annual maximum floods, namely the Hall's norming constants method (H-NCM) and the Fisher and Tippetts' norming constants method (FT-NCM) respectively. A comparative study of these three methods was carried out using hydrological streamflow series of 77 stations in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, China. The results found that H-NCM outperforms both C-NCM and FT-NCM for the stations with relatively low-skewness coefficient of AMFS. Therefore, H-NCM is recommended to prioritize for practical applications when considering daily streamflow rather than small samples of flood events. Furthermore, if the skewness coefficient exceeds C-s,C-Gumbel approximate to 1.14, the overall modelling performance of these three methods is significantly deteriorated. This can provide some reference for the applicability of the norming constants method in flood frequency analysis.

Cross-sectoral and multiscalar exposure assessment to advance climate adaptation policy: The case of future coastal flooding of California's airports	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Interconnected infrastructure; Exposure analysis; Policy review; Collaborative governance; Climate change	COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; IMPACT; PATHWAYS; AVIATION; NETWORK	Climate adaptation is inevitable to managing the climate risk of infrastructure systems and has become an emerging topic in the past decade. Despite the growing need for collaborative and multi-agency efforts in climate change adaptation, however, current airport and transportation governance structures reinforce siloed approaches to manage climate risk. Here we combine a novel coastal flooding exposure assessment of California's airports and a policy review to address the importance of collaborative climate adaptation by viewing airport infrastructures as inter-connected systems across spatial scales and sectors. Our exposure assessment innovates by investigating the airport perimeter, its interconnected infrastructure (road access, ground-based navigation and communications systems), and multimodal interregional transportation corri-dors. At the local scale, we find that substantial airport assets are exposed as early as 2020-2040, suggesting the urgency for near-term adaptation actions. Regarding the interconnected in-frastructures, 23 unaccounted airports are identified at risk of disruption when compared with existing studies, including global hubs such as the Los Angeles International Airport. At the regional scale, we investigate how exposed airports transfer risk within the interregional multi -modal transportation corridors, and we identify the critical airports within these corridors to be prioritized for adaptation. Finally, based on a policy review of more than 100 state legislature and planning documents, implications of our results are discussed at the national and state levels. This study presents a new generation of infrastructure exposure assessment to climate-induced hazards, by addressing cross-sectoral and multiscalar dependencies that are currently overlooked by adaptation policies. We also argue that new modes of collaborative efforts are needed to achieve effective climate adaptation for interconnected infrastructures.

Ho Chi Minh City has experienced increased intensity and frequency of climate change-induced urban floods, causing socio-economic damage that disturbs their livelihoods while urban populations continue to grow. This study aims to establish a citywide flood risk map to inform risk management in the city and address climate justice locally. This study applied a flood risk assessment framework integrating a coupled nature-human approach and examined the spatial distribution of urban flood hazard and urban flood vulnerability. A flood hazard map was generated using selected morphological and hydro-meteorological indicators. A flood vulnerability map was generated based on a literature review and a social survey weighed by experts' priorities using the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytic Network Process. Vulnerability indicators including demographic characteristics, infrastructure, and land use patterns were used to generate a flood vulnerability map. The results illustrate that almost the entire central and northeastern parts of the city are at high flood risk, whereas the western part is at low flood risk. The findings have implications in urban planning via identifying risk hot spots in order to prioritize resources for mitigating hazards and enhancing community resilience to urban floods.

A Review of Several Experimental and Numerical Simulation Approaches	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						pluvial floods; urban resilience; inlet systems; hydraulic efficiency; discharge coefficient; experimental campaigns; numerical studies	HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; METHODOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; MODEL	Urban drainage networks should be designed and operated preferably under open channel flow conditions without flux return, backwater, or overflows. In the case of extreme storm events, urban pluvial flooding is generated by the excess of surface runoff that could not be conveyed by pressurized sewer pipes, due to its limited capacity or, many times, due to the poor efficiency of surface drainage systems to collect uncontrolled overland flow. Generally, the hydraulic design of sewer systems is addressed more for underground networks, neglecting the surface drainage system, although inadequate inlet spacings and locations can cause dangerous flooding with relevant socio-economic impacts and the interruption of critical services and urban activities. Several experimental and numerical studies carried out at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) and other research institutions demonstrated that the hydraulic efficiency of inlets can be very low under critical conditions (e.g., high circulating overland flow on steep areas). In these cases, the hydraulic efficiency of conventional grated inlets and continuous transverse elements can be around 10-20%. Their hydraulic capacity, expressed in terms of discharge coefficients, shows the same criticism with values quite far from those that are usually used in several project practice phases. The grate clogging phenomenon and more intense storm events produced by climate change could further reduce the inlets' performance. In this context, in order to improve the flood urban resilience of our cities, the relevance of the hydraulic behavior of surface drainage systems is clear.

Social impacts significantly affect the recovery processes of individuals, social groups, and institutions in the medium and long term. Hence, the management of such impacts throughout the disaster life cycle is essential. International institutions and frameworks for disaster risk reduction have claimed the need to generate tools for the systematic assessment and management of social impacts of floods. Recently, an innovative line of research has emerged aimed at adapting social impact assessment (SIA), usually directed at the evaluation of planned interventions (programs, plans and projects), to the field of environmental disasters. In order to contribute to academic efforts in this emerging field, this paper puts forward, through a systematic literature review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, an SIA methodological proposal for the identification, assessment and systematic management of the social impacts of flood events. This methodological proposal covers the three phases of the disaster cycle: (1) pre-event (preparedness), allowing the anticipation of potential impacts and supporting the proposal of preventive measures; (2) event (response), facilitating a strategic mobilization of resources and technical support towards previously identified critical disaster areas; and (3) post-event (recovery), evaluating the evolutionary dynamics of impacts, proposing measures to avoid their socio-territorial embedding and accelerating recovery processes. This tool is designed for strategic use by policy makers and managers responsible for flood risk management and regional development.

Variations in Flash Flood-Producing Storm Characteristics Associated with Changes in Vertical Velocity in a Future Climate in the Mississippi River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Flood events; Precipitation; Climate change; Hydrometeorology	PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; EVENTS	The Mississippi River basin (MRB) is a flash flood hotspot receiving the most frequent flash floods and highest average rainfall accumulation of any region in the United States. Given the destruction flash floods cause in the current climate in the MRB, it is critical to understand how they will change in a future, warmer climate in order to prepare for these impacts. Recent work utilizing convection-permitting climate simulations to analyze future precipitation changes in flash flood-producing storms in the United States shows that the MRB experiences the greatest future increase in flash flood rainfall. This result motivates the goal of the present study to better understand the changes to precipitation characteristics and vertical velocity in flash flood-producing storms in the MRB. Specifically, the variations in flash flood-producing storm characteristics related to changes in vertical velocity in the MRB are examined by identifying 484 historical flash flood-producing storms from 2002 and 2013 and studying how they change in a future climate using 4-km convection-permitting simulations under a pseudo-global warming framework. In a future climate, precipitation and runoff increase by 17% and 32%, respectively, in flash flood-producing storms in the MRB. While rainfall increases in all flash flood-producing storms due to similar increases in moisture, it increases the most in storms with the strongest vertical velocity, suggesting that storm dynamics might modulate future changes in rainfall. These results are necessary to predict and prepare for the multifaceted impacts of climate change on flash flood-producing storms in order to create more resilient communities.

Forest Disturbance Types and Current Analogs for Historical Disturbance-Independent Forests	LAND			English	Article						analogue; climate; climate change; disturbance; maple; no-analog; novel; old growth	BEECH BARK DISEASE; HEMLOCK-HARDWOOD FORESTS; OAK FORESTS; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; RANGE; VEGETATION; DECLINE; FIRE; CONSEQUENCES	Forest classifications by disturbance permit designation of multiple types of both old growth forests and shorter-lived forests, which auto-replace under severe disturbance, and also identification of loss of the disturbance type and associated forest. Historically, fire and flooding disturbance regimes, or conversely, infrequent disturbance, produced unique forests such as disturbance-independent forests of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in the Eastern United States. However, disturbance has changed to primarily frequent mechanical overstory disturbance, resulting in novel forests. To demonstrate the transition to no-analog forests after disturbance change, I compared historical tree surveys (ca. 1837 to 1857) to current surveys in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. To establish widespread disturbance change effects, I also located where beech and hemlock are currently most abundant throughout the Eastern US compared to historical distribution of beech-hemlock forests. In the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, beech and hemlock historically were about 30% of all trees, but currently, beech and hemlock are 2% of all trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) increased from 1% to 11% of all trees and aspen (Populus) increased from 2% to 13% of all trees. The squared-chord difference between historical and current surveys was 0.40, or dissimilar forests. Areas with >= 20% beech and hemlock or >= 15% of either species decreased from about 52 million to 6 million hectares, with current distribution restricted to the Northeastern US. Current forests are dissimilar to historical forests, and this transition appears to be driven by disturbance regimes without historical analogs. Disturbance change may provide perspective in forest management for climate change.

The study treats the 2016 catastrophic flood event in Anhui Province, China as a natural experiment using a difference-in-differences design with propensity score matching to exclude background variations of diarrhea occurrence and meteorological effects, thus isolating the net effect of flooding on diarrhea. A triple-differences analysis was further deployed to identify the potential effect modifiers, including gender, age, occupation and community health resources. By analyzing 359 580 cases of diarrhea that occurred before, during and after the flooding, we show that the 2016 flood event significantly increased the risk of dysentery (RR: 1.29, 95%CI: 1.15-1.46) in during-flood period, and also increased the risk of all-cause diarrhea (RR: 1.21, 95%CI: 1.17-1.26), typhoidal diarrhea, dysentery, and other infectious diarrhea in post-flood period. Children, males and non-farmers were particularly vulnerable to flooding impacts and the density of health professionals was found to be protective against diarrheal risk in both during-flood (RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.92) and post-flood (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77-0.88) periods. This study employs quasi-experimental design and provides a better understanding on both acute and sustained effects of flooding on diarrhea, which is important for accurate health impact assessments and developing targeted intervention strategies.

J. H.			Hard or soft flood adaptation? Advantages of a hybrid strategy for Shanghai	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate change; Nonstationarity; Coastal flood; Risk management; Cost-benefit analysis	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; FREQUENCY; PREPARE; CITIES; CHINA; CITY	Flood risk is expected to increase in coastal cities, particularly in Asian megacities such as Shanghai. This paper presents an integrated modeling framework to simulate changes in the flood risk in Shanghai and provide a cost-benefit analysis of multiple adaptation strategies used to reduce risk. The results show that the potential flood risk will increase dramatically as a result of sea level rise, land subsidence, and socioeconomic development. By 2100, the expected annual damage could reach 0.8% (uncertainty range: 0.4%-1.4%) of local GDP under an optimistic emission scenario (RCP4.5), compared to the current value of 0.03%. All of the adaptation strategies can effectively reduce the flood risk under the current conditions and those in 2050. In contrast to the 'hard' flood protection strategies (i.e., storm-surge barriers and floodwalls), the 'soft' strategies (i.e., building codes and nature-based measures) cannot substantially reduce the flood risk in 2100. However, the soft strategies can play a critical role in reducing the residual risk resulting from the hard strategies. A 'hybrid' strategy combining a storm-surge barrier, wet-proofing, and coastal wetland development outperforms both hard and soft strategies in terms of low residual risk and high benefit/cost ratio. Additionally, the hybrid strategy can also enable a larger reduction in casualties. These findings imply that managing flood risk is more than the use of single adaptation measures. The methodology developed in this paper can enlighten Shanghai and other coastal cities on an economically and socially feasible adaptation strategy in an uncertain future.

J	Belcore, E; Pezzoli, A; Calvo, A				Belcore, Elena; Pezzoli, Alessandro; Calvo, Angela			Analysis of gender vulnerability to climate-related hazards in a rural area of Ethiopia	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						climate change; drought; Ethiopia; gender; sustainability; vulnerability analysis	ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE	Identifying areas of the world, communities, and women and men that could be damaged by meteorological events (like droughts and floods) has been crucial for vulnerability studies in the last decade. Climate change may differently affect female- and male-headed households, especially in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where they react in a different way to the effects of adverse weather events. The aim of this work was to analyse a population's vulnerability and resilience to climate-related hazards, applying a sex-disaggregated, quantitative methodology at household level. This study was realised in three Woredas (Siraro, Shalla, and Shashemene) of the Oromia Region in Ethiopia. The information used for the evaluation included climatic conditions, socio-economic variables and natural resource availability. All data collected were analysed after disaggregation by sex. Evaluation of the indices shows that the vulnerability of the households is particularly related to the presence of governmental infrastructure, availability of water sources, and external aid. The study reveals that the Woreda of Siraro is the most vulnerable. A better situation appears in the Woredas of Shalla and Shashemene, where women and men have more skills to face vulnerability, as highlighted by the "recovery potential" index. On the other hand, the study points out some differences between women and men. While male-headed households mainly have low vulnerability and high resilience, female-headed households are divided into two main classes: low vulnerability associated with low resilience, and low vulnerability associated with high resilience. When the vulnerability is higher, both women and men show higher resilience.

Although numerous factors can be involved, climate-induced floods are one of the most critical limiting factors in the aquaculture and fisheries industry's development. Understanding the extent of losses and damages caused by floods at the farm level will thereby exacerbate pre-emptive policy responses. Thus, the impact of floods on fish production by focusing on catfish earthen pond-based farmers in Southwest Nigeria is presented. A survey is conducted for 150 fish farms in the region. A marginal treatment effects (MTE) approach is employed to determine the heterogeneity across the households and the policy-relevant treatment effects (PRTE). The results show significant heterogeneity in the effects of floods on fish production, considering both observed and unobserved characteristics of the farmers. It is shown that flood significantly increases output loss. Furthermore, farmers with high propensity scores to flood tend to have a high likelihood of incurring output loss. The estimates of PRTE reveal that relaxing policy strategies, such as access to climate information and climate-related training and workshops, would significantly exacerbate output loss due to flood incidences. Thus, intensifying awareness and sensitization on climate change policies will address the flood menace and still increase food production.

This impact is projected to increase due to ongoing climate change. Therefore, this study, for the first time, discusses the death toll related to selected sudden severe weather phenomena in Central Europe in the 2010-2020 period with particular attention put to the death circumstances caused by the severe weather fatality, and their spatial and temporal distribution. In this study, severe wind, severe rainfall, lightning strikes, tornadoes and avalanches are considered. The data on phenomena occurrence were taken from the verified European Severe Weather Database. The study revealed that an average of 73 people died per year, and 365 people were hurt annually due to severe weather in the study period. Avalanches were found to be the deadliest phenomena, followed by severe wind, lightning and heavy rain. The majority of victims were killed during outdoor activities, such as spending free time outside or driving;however, the dominating death circumstances varied within the analysed domain and were different than those in the other regions of the world. This findings should be taken into account while creating national early-warning systems and better gathering severe weather impact data. Education and raising society awareness according to our results should be implemented as well.

How to reduce its impact has become an important topic. However, the studies that both consider the disaster's real-time geographic information and environmental factors in severe rainstorms are still not enough. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) data that was generated during disasters offered possibilities for improving the emergency management abilities of decision-makers and the disaster self-rescue abilities of citizens. Through the case study of the extreme rainstorm disaster in Zhengzhou, China, in July 2021, this paper used machine learning to study VGI issued by residents. The vulnerable people and their demands were identified based on the SOS messages. The importance of various indicators was analyzed by combining open data from socio-economic and built-up environment elements. Potential safe areas with shelter resources in five administrative districts in the disaster-prone central area of Zhengzhou were identified based on these data. This study found that VGI can be a reliable data source for future disaster research. The characteristics of rainstorm hazards were concluded from the perspective of affected people and environmental indicators. The policy recommendations for disaster prevention in the context of public participation were also proposed.

The influence of HMA snow cover on its surrounding areas has always been a research hotspot. Taking the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) of China as an example, this paper analyzes the relationship between winter snow depth in HMA and drought and flood in spring and summer in the YRB in the recent 40 years by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The results show that the influence of snow cover on drought and flood in spring is inversely different between eastern and western parts of HMA, while the effect in summer is consistent. When the snow depth is larger (smaller) in the east and smaller (larger) in the west in winter, the YRB is drier (wetter) in spring. When the overall snow depth in HMA is larger (smaller) in winter, the northern part of the middle and lower reaches of the YRB is drier (wetter) in summer. The results provide support for understanding the impact of HMA snow cover on the surrounding climate and some important indicators for drought and flood prediction in the YRB.

J	Rampini, C				Rampini, Costanza			Climate and energy justice along the Brahmaputra river in Northeast India	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Brahmaputra; floods; hydropower; climate adaptation; Northeast India	SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION; HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT; SOLAR-ENERGY; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; FLOOD; POWER; DAMS; RESILIENCE	Recurrent summer floods along the Brahmaputra river and its tributaries are a major challenge for the people and state governments of Northeast India. While riverine communities in the region rely upon a variety of adaptation strategies to live with these destructive floods, climate change is expected to further exacerbate this challenge, as melting Himalayan glaciers and changes in the South Asian monsoon lead to an increase in the frequency of severe floods. At the same time, a multitude of new dams are under construction in the Brahmaputra river basin, to meet India's growing energy demands. Though these dams could provide flood protection for downstream communities, political and economic factors have led dam-builders to prioritize hydroelectricity generation over flood control. Furthermore, hydroelectricity generated along the Brahmaputra is "evacuated" to distant urban centers, while rural dwellers in Northeast India suffer from high levels of energy poverty. Using the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh as a case study, this paper examines how, by changing the flood regime and undermining current adaptive strategies, large dams along the Brahmaputra are testing the capacity of downstream communities to live with summer floods. This work highlights the ways in which poor and vulnerable communities in Northeast India are forced to bear the costs of both climate change impacts and decarbonization efforts.

Environmental Issues Are Health Issues Making a Case and Setting an Agenda for Environmental Health Psychology	EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						environmental health; science of behavior change; health psychology; environmental psychology; intervention	BEHAVIOR-CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AIR-POLLUTION; RISK PERCEPTION; MODEL; VALUES; WATER; INTERVENTIONS; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS	Increasing demands on ecosystems, decreasing biodiversity, and climate change are among the most pressing environmental issues of our time. As changing weather conditions are leading to increased vector-borne diseases and heat- and flood-related deaths, it is entering collective consciousness: environmental issues are human health issues. In public health, the field addressing these issues is known as environmental health. This field addresses both the effects people have on their environment as well as the effects of the environment on people. Psychology, as a discipline concerned with explaining, predicting, and changing behavior has much to contribute to these issues because human behavior is key in promoting environmental health. To date, however, an integrative view of environmental health in psychology is lacking, hampering urgently needed progress. In this paper, we review how the environment and human health are intertwined, and that much can be gained through a systemic view of environmental health in psychology. Based on a review of the literature, we suggest that psychologists unite efforts to promote an integrative science and practice of environmental health psychology, and jointly address environmental-health related behavior. The research agenda for this field will include integrating behavior change theory and intervention approaches. Thereby, psychology can potentially make an important contribution to sustained environmental health for generations to come.

Communities along the Mekong River have adapted to variability in temperature, rainfall, and flooding patterns over time. Rapid environmental change in the Mekong Basin presents a new set of challenges related to drought, altered seasonal rainfall, more frequent high-flow flood events, and water withdrawals for hydropower and irrigation. We present a multi-method approach to understand how local knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of floods, droughts, and rainfall can be integrated with scientific information along a flood-prone section of the lower Mekong River in Kratie Province, Cambodia. Participatory hazard mapping of community members' knowledge of the movement of floodwaters through the landscape enabled interpretation of flood extent mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar images from the Sentinel-1A satellite. Seasonal calendars of weather patterns and livelihood activities, together with local indicators of flooding, rainfall, and drought were compared with trends in 35 years of rainfall data, and highlighted "pressure points" at the beginning and end of the rainy season where agriculture may be particularly impacted by climate change. We discuss potential applications of our findings for adaptation and hazard planning.

A micro-scale cost-benefit analysis of building-level flood risk adaptation measures in Los Angeles	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Adaptation; Building level; Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Flood risk analysis; Sea level rise	CLIMATE-CHANGE; STRATEGIES; COMMUNICATION; RESILIENCE; CITIES; PROTECTION; MOTIVATION; PATHWAYS	Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise. However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35%-45% dry-flood proofing measures and 55%-65% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth.

Environmental injustice and Hurricane Harvey: A household-level study of socially disparate flood exposures in Greater Houston, Texas, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hurricane Harvey; Flood; Environmental justice; Race/ethnicity; Socioeconomic status	LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; HAZARDOUS AIR-POLLUTANTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH DISPARITIES; UNITED-STATES; RISK; JUSTICE; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; POLLUTION	Environmental justice research on flooding has relied heavily on analyses of aggregated geographic areal units and assessing exposure to 'pre-flood' risks (e.g., residence in 100-year flood zones) rather than actual flood events. To address these limitations, we examined disproportionate exposure to flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Greater Houston (Texas). Using primary survey data collected from 377 representative households before Harvey and spatial data on Harvey-induced inundation developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, we found that the areal extent of flooding around residents' home sites was distributed inequitably with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Hispanic, black and other racial/ethnic minority households experienced more extensive flooding than white households, and lower SES households faced more extensive flooding than higher SES households. Findings align with prior flood risk research in Greater Houston and provide cause for concern, as social inequities in flood exposure may have influenced social disparities in flood impacts and post-disaster needs. Since flood events in Greater Houston are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change, socially disparate impacts are likely to become an increasingly salient public policy issue. Thus, proactive approaches for reducing flood risks and ameliorating disparities should be implemented.

We utilized improved cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products to evaluate the modelled snow-covered area, indicating a good performance of the snow modelling. We analysed the intra- and inter-annual variations of the simulated hydrological variables and the synchronous climate variables (air temperature and precipitation). Trend detection indicates a significant SWE decline throughout the snow season, but principally at the high elevations; the most severe warming occurred in early spring (March), whereas precipitation showed a slight increase in January and February. The snowpack in February has displayed the most striking reduction during the past 56 years, which is likely related to both the highest susceptibility of snow to warming and the increased ROS occurrence in February since the early 1990s. The increased combination of high temperatures and extreme rainfalls, as well as the earlier snowmelt, has resulted in a run-off increase during the earlier winter but a decrease in March. The expected changing climate towards warmer and wetter winters will probably exacerbate winter flooding in the future.

The aftermath of losing one's home leaves people facing difficult decisions. Resettling those affected by flood disasters remains a complex and uncertain process. This study aims to shed light on the factors influencing the decision to choose post-flood public houses (PFPH) in flood-prone areas. Using a stated preference (SP) survey conducted in the floodplains of Southern Pakistan, this research analyzes the impact of policy variables in conjunction with latent psychometric factors on people's choices. A hybrid choice model (HCM) is developed to assess the influence of two latent variables: risk perception and place attachment. The findings indicate that individuals with higher risk perception are more inclined to choose PFPH, whereas those with stronger place attachment tend to opt for rebuilding their houses at the same location. Compensation for PFPH was observed to have a positive impact on the choice of PFPH, while the distance from the village center, reflecting how far they would be relocated from their current village center, had a negative impact on choosing PFPH. The calculation of willingness-to-accept measures confirmed that for every 1 KM increase in the distance from the village center, respondents would require additional compensation of PKR 24,558.45 (approximately $87.28). Furthermore, multiple policy scenario tests were conducted to economically evaluate the impact of latent variables and SP attributes on the predicted share of PFPH. The results underscore the significant influence of place attachment attitudes and the distance to the village center attribute on the share of PFPH.

Landscape Pollution Source Dynamics Highlight Priority Locations for Basin-Scale Interventions to Protect Water Quality Under Hydroclimatic Variability	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						hydrologic modeling; SWAT; non-point source pollution; nature-based solutions; watershed management	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; SWINE-LAGOON SEEPAGE; LAND-COVER; NORTH-CAROLINA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SUPPORT PRACTICES; ANIMAL PRODUCTION; LOBLOLLY-PINE; SOIL-EROSION	Extreme weather is associated with a variety of water quality issues that can pose harm to humans and aquatic ecosystems. Under dry conditions, contaminants become concentrated in streams with a greater potential for harmful algal blooms, while wet conditions can cause flooding and broadcast pollution. Developing interventions to improve water quality in a changing climate requires a better understanding of how hydroclimatic variability affects watershed processes, and which places are most vulnerable. We developed a Soil and Water Assessment Tool model of the Cape Fear River Basin (CFRB) in North Carolina, USA, representing contemporary land use, point and non-point sources, and weather conditions from 1979 to 2019. The CFRB is a large, complex river basin undergoing urbanization and agricultural intensification, with a history of droughts and floods. To identify intervention priorities, we developed a Water Quality Risk Index (WQRI) using the average and variability of contaminant loads across dry, normal and wet conditions. The landscape generally contributed the majority of pollutants (e.g., via erosion, fertilizer and manure applications), including 90.1% of sediment, 83.2% of total nitrogen, and 52.4% of total phosphorus at the City of Wilmington's drinking water intake, yet point sources were influential during dry periods. Approximately 16% of the watershed contributed most of the pollutants across conditions-these represent priority locations for interventions such as restoration, urban, or agricultural best management practices. The WQRI approach considering risks to water quality across conditions can help identify locations where interventions are more likely to improve water quality under climate change.

Path dependency is a prominent concept in the adaptation pathways literature, but insufficiently defined and operationalised. The present paper empirically tracks all constitutive elements of path dependency for four decades of flood risk management (FRM) in two alpine mountain regions in Austria, the Ennstal and Aist river catchments, using a mixed-methods approach. FRM governance has a critical role whether decisions lead to path dependency. Lock-in manifests not just in technical structures, but also in inertia of incumbent actor coalitions and management paradigms. Sub-optimality is hard to assess for lack of clearly defined protection targets; however, it appears in the ways that structural measures are implemented-too little, too late or with negative impacts on nature conservation. Past floods do not qualify as contingent events, as they have not fundamentally changed FRM practice. By contrast, technological and institutional shifts over longer periods, such as digital hazard maps and EU directives, have gradually reoriented FRM strategies. Institution-based self-reinforcing mechanisms are more prevalent than technology-based self-reinforcing mechanisms. Established actor coalitions combined with institutional density illustrate how those in charge uphold a path to defend their position, power and resources. Our recommendations for how to overcome path dependency in FRM governance are: encourage niche experiments, link FRM more closely with climate change adaptation, revise the national policy framework towards polycentric governance approaches and improve professional training.

Consideration of both climatic and non-climatic factors is required since non-climatic factors could be controlled to build resilience against floods. The indicator-based flood vulnerability index methodology is applicable worldwide, but the indicators used in this study were specifically related to the Pacific Island context. In the context of fluvial flood vulnerability, effects of land management and climate change are not mutually exclusive of each other. Consequently, vulnerability assessments should consider the connection between people's actions and ecosystems for the entire catchment area since upstream land use practices influence flood vulnerabilities downstream. In our research, a community-based flood vulnerability index system in conjunction with rainfall variability and land use assessments was used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the flood vulnerability, and it was found that increased rainfall, poor agricultural practices, gravel extraction, and improper waste management predominantly increased the exposure and sensitivity of midstream and downstream communities to river floods by modifying river morphology. Midstream communities in the Waimanu Catchment were most vulnerable to river floods due to their very low adaptive capacity in terms of poor ecosystem health and lack of natural resources to cope with the subsequent impacts of floods, being most sensitive to changes in land use and land cover.

This implies that a constant model structure and parameterization are assumed. However, if the catchment system is subject to changes that are not incorporated in the model, the parameter values found in a calibration period may not be optimal for other periods, which is called systemic change. The aim of this study was to identify systemic change and its possible causes with the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model in the Rhine-Meuse basin, by performing a brute-force calibration for multiple periods for five calibration locations between 1901-2010. Systemic change was studied for the main model components, by selecting a key parameter from each component (minimum soil depth fraction, saturated hydraulic conductivity, groundwater recession coefficient, degree day factor, Manning's n). These parameters were calibrated for 10-year rolling periods between 1901-2010. The results showed that at the downstream locations, the changes in optimal parameter values were small, while at the upstream locations, the optimal values of most parameters changed considerably over the different rolling calibration periods, signifying systemic change. Especially the degree day factor showed large variations, varying over time between 0.5 and 2.5 times its default value at Basel and Maxau (upstream and middle part of the Rhine basin). Based on correlation analysis, it was found that climate change as well as changes in land use and river structure are possible causes of changes in optimal parameter values through time.

Study focus: Studying reference ecosystems and their specific features provides information to be used as background principles for ecosystem management. In the case of riparian wetlands, these are hydrological indicators (such as average water levels, flooding extents and flood duration) that are either used as criteria for ecosystem conservation or remain easy-to-measure targets for habitat restoration. We focused on revealing whether any trends in flood extents and durations of inundation exist within near-natural temperate floodplains persisting under the natural lowland river flow regime. We analysed whether the fraction of inundation time in a year (FIT) changed over time. River discharge data from 1951 to 2011 applied as boundary conditions in a 1D hydrodynamic model were used to generate flood extents and durations in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza Valley. New hydrological insights for the region: We found no substantial trends in flood extents and flood durations in both time-dependent mean and standard deviation. We revealed that the average, long-term values of the FIT, influencing the persistence of Caricetum approprinquatae, Caricetum gracilis, Glycerietum maximae and Phragmitetum communis, reached, respectively, 0.33, 0.43, 0.49 and 0.53 and did not present trends. Variability of the FIT within particular plant communities was high. The main challenges in conservation of temperate riparian wetlands are likely related to appropriate management addressing nonlinear climatic pressures.

Climate change will probably increase the incidence of coastal recession and flooding of deltas. Reducing the vulnerability of deltas/coastal zones requires comprehensive studies to plan appropriate adaptation policies. However, studies on the coastal hazards of Densu delta have been limited to a few localities and also of short-term periods of less than a decade. Owing to uncertainties of natural hazard processes long-time and cyclical analysis of coastal zones provides accurate data on the state of such physical forces and their impact on the landscape and human activities if habited. Accordingly, a holistic investigation of the hazards plaguing the deltaic coastline from a long-term perspective was undertaken to determine hazards plaguing the delta and investigate the causes and impacts on the livelihoods of residents, undertake a longer-term shoreline change analysis of the coastline, and have understanding on institutional management and coping strategies of residents to the hazards. Methods adopted for the study included interviews and focus group discussions, shoreline change analysis and field exploration. The study revealed that the Densu delta is plagued by floods and coastal recession which are affecting lives and properties. Several human and physical processes (e.g., sea-level rise, increasing rainfall, encroachment of reservations) were identified as drivers of these hazards. Government needs to resource local authorities and relevant statutory agencies to enable them effectively perform their roles regarding development planning in the locality to curb these hazards.

Conventionally engineered, 'grey' stormwater infrastructure often is outdated and unable to control these increased runoff volumes. Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) can complement grey infrastructure, but public land for its installation is limited. Consequently, municipalities often look to residential properties to install GSI at the lot-level. While many studies have been conducted in the engineering aspects of GSI, less is known about what determines residents' decisions to install GSI on their properties. To help close this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey of social-psychological determinants of residential GSI implementation using the Theory of Planned Behavior as theoretical framework, and analyzing our data with partial least squares path modeling. Results from three neighborhoods of our case study area suggest that residents' decisions to install GSI largely are determined by social norms and perceived control factors such as available finances and time. However, residents' beliefs and attitudes toward the effectiveness and attractiveness of GSI did not seem to play a significant role. Neighborhood characteristics including local flooding history did not seem to affect residents' decisions about GSI installation either. We recommend creation of effective municipal education and outreach programs regarding urban stormwater management that speak to residents' shared responsibility and options for addressing this issue, as well as creation of financial instruments that provide meaningful subsidies for residential GSI adoption.

According to villagers' observations, this land use change has, together with climate change, led to an increase in the magnitude and frequency of river flood events, which constrain village and plantation development. Based on this empirical societal problem, we investigate whether we can find measurable indications for the presumed linkages between land use change, climate change, and changing flooding regimes. We follow an explorative, bottom-up research approach that builds on a review of multidisciplinary datasets, integrating local ecological knowledge with scientific measurements from soil science, climatology, hydrology, and remote sensing. We found that water levels of one of the largest rivers in Jambi Province, the Tembesi, have increased significantly during the last two decades. Data of local and regional meteorological stations show that alterations in rainfall patterns may only partly explain these changes. Rather, increased soil densities and decreased water infiltration rates in monoculture plantations suggest an increase in surface runoff following forest conversion. Moreover, additional interview data reveal that an increasing encroachment of wetlands in Jambi Province may contribute to changes in local flooding regimes, as the construction of drainage and flood control infrastructure redistributes floodwater at the local scale. We conclude that changing flooding regimes are the result of multiple interacting social-ecological processes associated with the expansion of rubber and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province. Although ecohydrological changes are likely to contribute to an increase of flood occurrence, their social impacts are increasingly mediated through flood control infrastructure on industrial oil palm plantations.

Seven palynological zones were defined to reveal Holocene climate fluctuations. Zone I (ca. 9000-7000 cal yr BP) was a period of warming climate, succeeded by a progressive drying climate phase in Zones II-VII (ca. 7000-2000 cal yr BP). Pollen records indicate Nile flooding prevailed before 7000 years ago, making the study area uninhabitable, before it later developed into a wetland setting. The earliest farming started at ca. 6700 cal yr BP, as indicated by the abrupt appearance of cereal (Poaceae > 35 mu m), during a time of climate warming (Zone III), This material can be differentiated from wild Poaceae (< 35 mu m), which occurs throughout the profile, indicating the cereal was introduced to this area for agriculture. Results further reveal the transformation of human activities, from passive adaptation to climate, to actively remolding the environment against the background of long-term drying. During the early farming stage (ca. 6700-5500 cal yr BP), climate-human indicators were synchronous in distribution, suggesting lower pressure from climate change on population growth; however, this reversed from ca. 5500 cal yr BP, as intensive agriculture was required to meet shortages of natural resources during climate drying. Perhaps, the best evidence for adaptation is the increased abundance of Azolla from ca. 4000 years ago, a fern that favours growing in still-water bodies, hinting that much more irrigation was required at the time to sustain societal development.

In recent decades, these eco-sensitive waterbodies have been exposed to a wide range of anthropogenic threats and climatic changes. Therefore, assessment of these ecological and environmental threats is prerequisite to understand the state of ecosystem and to develop a sustainable management strategy for conservation of wetland biodiversity and fisheries enhancement. This paper discusses the region-specific pattern of trophic state index (TSI) of the 27 floodplain wetlands in West Bengal, India. Carlson TSI and Lamparelli TSI methods were used to determine a better approach based on historical and continuous dataset and to delineate the interrelationship among historical climatic variability for sustainable management of the resources. The study revealed that agro-climatic divisions do not unveil any significant impact on the TSI calculated using Carlson TSI as well as Lamparelli TSI method. The TSI scores for the two methods were significantly different (p < 0.01) for different zones based on wetland habitat types. The TSI scores revealed most of the wetlands to be in mesotrophic state. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that TSI scores were having similar pattern of variation with rainfall and water temperature. The present study also conveys fundamental information on ecological status based on the trophic state, which will aid to develop region-specific strategies for sustainable fisheries enhancement.

Natural Land Cover in Agricultural Catchments Alters Flood Effects on DOM Composition and Decreases Nutrient Levels in Streams	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic carbon; DOC; agriculture; TDP; TDN; flooding; cropland; BDOC	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; SURFACE RUNOFF; BUFFER ZONES; CARBON; EXPORT; FLUORESCENCE; HYDROLOGY; METABOLISM; EFFICIENCY	A shift in natural hydrologic patterns, such as increases in the frequency, and changes in the magnitude of flood events are expected with climate change. A better understanding of how land use and hydrological patterns interact to affect solute levels in aquatic systems is needed so we can better navigate expected climatic changes. Here we analyzed spatiotemporal event-based data from 21 predominantly agricultural catchments with varying contributions of natural land cover. We studied the effect of hydrological events on stream dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and bioavailability over 4 years. Our results suggest that flow regime and flood condition control stream DOM composition, nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics, modulated by seasonal processes and land use properties, like soil organic carbon content. Although higher flows generally increased solute concentrations as well as the fraction of terrestrial, humic-like DOM, this pattern was highly dependent on the catchment land use and event timing. General additive models indicated a threshold of about 30-40% natural land cover, below which DOC and nutrients showed a positive relationship with discharge, but when more than 30-40% natural features (for example, wetlands, woodlots and grasslands) were present in the catchments, this shifted to a negative relationship. This suggests that in agricultural landscapes, the presence of natural land cover is important as it can decrease solute concentrations in streams and may act as a buffer, mitigating the effect of floods on DOM and nutrient export rates.

The hydrological regimes, as well as vegetation dynamics, in the wetland have experienced substantial changes due to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams. However, few studies have investigated how the wetland vegetation has changed over time, particularly during the wintering season, and how this has directly affected habitat suitability for migratory waterfowl. Thus, it is necessary to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in the protected wetland and explore the potential factors that alter it. In this study, the data set of time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2018 was used to analyze the seasonal dynamics and interannual trends of vegetation over the wintering period from October to January. The results showed that the average NDVI exhibited an overall increasing trend, with the trend rising slowly in recent years. The largest monthly mean NDVI generally occurred in November, which is pertinent to the quantity of wintering waterfowl in the East Dongting Lake wetland. Meanwhile, the mean NDVI in the wintering season is significantly correlated to temperature and water area, with apparent lagging effects. Long-term stability analysis presented a gradually decreasing pattern from the central body of water to the surrounding area. All analyses will help the government to make appropriate management strategies to protect the habitat of wintering waterfowl in the wetland.

Everest region; Nepal	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLACIAL LAKE; CORDILLERA BLANCA; OUTBURST FLOODS; IMJA GLACIER; VULNERABILITY; HIMALAYA; ADAPTATION; TSHO; IDENTIFICATION	Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)are among the most serious cryospheric hazards for mountain communities. Multiple studies havepredicted thepotential risks posed by rapidly expanding glacial lakes in the Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone of Nepal. People's perceptions of such cryospheric hazards can influence their actions, beliefs, and responses to those hazards and associated risks. This study provides a systematic approach that combines household survey data with ethnography to analyze people's perceptions of GLOF risks and the socioeconomic and cultural factors influencing their perceptions. A statistical logit model of household data showed a significant positive correlation between the perceptions of GLOF risks and livelihood sources, mainly tourism. Risk perceptions are also influenced by spatial proximity to glacial lakes and whether a village is in potential flood zones. The 2016 emergency remediation work implemented in the Imja Tsho (glacial lake) has served as a cognitive fix, especially in the low-lying settlements. Much of uncertainty and confusions related GLOF risks among locals can be attributed to a disconnect between how scientific information is communicated to the local communities and how government climate change policies have been limited to awareness campaigns and emergency remediation efforts. A sustainable partnership of scientists, policymakers, and local communities is urgently needed to build a science-driven, community-based initiative that focuses not just in addressing a single GLOF threat but develops on a comprehensive cryospheric risk management plan and considers opportunities and challenges of tourism in the local climate adaptation policies.

This forest, situated in south-west Bangladesh, provides livelihood services to 3.5 million people. The livelihood provision of the Sundarbans forest has been invented due to climate-induced disasters, such as cyclones, sea-level rise, salinisation, heat waves, and flooding. Considering the impacts of cyclones Aila and Sidr, this autoethnographic study closely examines the long-established perceptions of women and men about the resources of the Sundarbans. While doing so, this study uses feminist political ecology as a theoretical framework. This study examines how these two cyclones transformed lives and gendered livelihoods of the villagers of Shora in the Sundarbans forest.

Recent studies have progressively been engrossed in demonstrating regional climate variations and associated flood probability to maintain the geo-ecological balance at micro to macro-regions. To carry out this investigation, various historical remote sensing record, reanalyzed and in-situ data sets were acquired with a high level of spatial precision using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) web-based remote sensing platform. Non-parametric techniques and multi-layer integration methods were then employed to illustrate the fluctuations in climate factors alongside creating maps indicating the susceptibility to floods. The study reveals an increased pattern in LST (Land Surface Tem-perature) (0.03 degrees C/year), albeit marginal declined in southern coastal regions (-0.15 degrees C/year) along with un-even rainfall patterns (1.42 mm/year). Moreover, long-term LULC change estimation divulges increased trends of urbanization (16.4 km2/year) together with vegetation growth (8.7 km2/year) from 2002 to 2022. Furthermore, this inquiry involves numerous environmental factors that influence the situation (elevation data, topographic wetness index, drainage density, proximity to water bodies, slope, and soil properties) as well as socio-economic attributes (population) to assess flood risk areas through the utilization of Analytical Hierarchy Process and overlay methods with assigned weights. The outcomes reveal nearly 55 percent of urban land is susceptible to flood in 2022, which were 45 and 37 percent in 2012 and 2002 separately. Additionally, 106 km2 of urban area is highly susceptible to inundation, whereas vegetation also occupies a significant proportion (52 km2).

The region still has been underthrusting at a rate of 4.5-5 cm/year causing the reshaping and changing of its geophysical characteristics (geology, geomorphology, relief, slope gradient, drainage system, etc.), whereas anthropogenic activities, particularly shifting cultivation and technological intervention, have caused changes or degradation of the ecological environment (air, land, water, vegetation, crop pattern, climate, wildlife, etc.). Addressing this burning geoecological problem, a geospatial technology-based case study from the Kohima district of Nagaland in the North East Hill region of India is presented here. Through the development and integration of multiple GIS modules, this reconnaissance study suggests that continuous seismic activities (about 27 seismic events/year) along tectonic faults, thrusts, and lithological shear zones have been reshaping and changing the geophysical environment, whereas the ecological environment has been changing or degrading due to decreasing natural landscape and habitats (forest area, water bodies, and shrubs) at an annual rate of 5.91 km2 (0.60%), increasing built-up area, agricultural land, and wasteland at an annual rate of 2.73 km2 (0.28%), 2.69 km2 (0.27%), and 0.49 km2 (0.05%) respectively. Results also suggest that environmental degradation results in accelerated trends of climate change (rising temperature at the rate of 0.13 degrees C/year, decreasing annual rainy days at the rate of 2 days/year, decreasing annual rainfall at the rate of 9.55 cm/year, mounting climatic zones at the rate of 175 m/year) and its adverse impacts (increasing extreme rainfall events at the rate of 3 events/year and causing cloud burst, erosion, landslides, and floods) in the region.

Thereafter, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was successfully calibrated at the Kaduna sub-basin. The SWAT model was then forced with the CORDEX_RCMs at four specific global warming levels (GWLs) (i.e., 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C) and the baseline (1971-2000). The water balance components (WBCs) generated at GWLs were compared with the baseline. The results indicate that the CORDEX_RCMs effectively simulated climate variables. The past and future projections (1950-2100) show an increase in annual streamflow of 4.7%, 5.9%, 3.4%, and 3.5% at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C, respectively, over the baseline. Similarly, with respect to baseline, changes are expected in average annual rainfall (+1.91%, +2.64%, +2.33%, and +2.41%), runoff (+1.37%, +3.81%, +1.17%, and +3.26%), potential evapotranspiration (+2.85%, +4.09%, +6.54%, and +6.60%), and evapotranspiration (-2.15%, -2.62%, -4.00%, and -4.33%) under 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C, respectively. Monthly streamflow for the dry and early rainy seasons is projected to decrease, while the late rainy season is expected to increase with an increase in GWLs. The implication is that while there may be a lack of water in the early rainy season, the flood event presently being witnessed in the late rainy season may become aggravated. Hence, adaptation strategies that take care of water deficit in the early rainy season and excess in the late rainy season should be put into consideration.

Yet, policy developments have often ignored the perspectives of residents who have experienced these floods. This study used a mixed-method approach including household surveys with 150 households and 5 key informant interviews to determine the drivers and coping mechanisms for floods in three selected communities in urban Kumasi, Ghana. Rainfall data (2001-2021) were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test. A binary logistic regression was used to determine the enablers and barriers to coping mechanisms for floods. Results showed that the study respondents perceived changes in rainfall and floods through increasing amounts of rainfall, increasing duration of the rainy season, and increased incidences of floods. The perceptions of the respondents regarding rainfall changes were consistent with the analyzed rainfall data (2001-2021) which showed an increasing annual rainfall. A multiplicity of causes including poor design of drains, choked drains, and inadequate drainage infrastructure were reported by the study respondents. Destruction of properties, decreased economic productivity and soil erosion were reported as the major effects of floods. The respondents implemented various coping mechanisms including temporary migration and relying on family and friends to manage the adverse effects of floods. Findings indicated that access to climate information, access to household communication gadgets, age of respondents, and period of staying in the community significantly affected the coping mechanisms employed by the respondents (p < 0.05). Barriers impeding the implementation of these coping mechanisms reported by the study respondents included financial constraints, inadequate support from government and non-governmental institutions, and a lack of understanding of early warning systems. Accessibility to timely climate information should be prioritized to help people improve their information-sharing and decision-making processes in managing floods in urban Kumasi.

J	He, W; Zhou, HX; Zhang, J; Xu, H; Liu, CS				He, Wei; Zhou, Hongxing; Zhang, Jian; Xu, Hui; Liu, Chunsheng			Combined effects of runoff increase and sea level rise on the water exchange and saltwater intrusion for an estuary bay in non-flood season	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						finite-volume community ocean model; runoff increase; saltwater intrusion; sea level rise; Wanquan Estuary Bay; water exchange	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; STREAMFLOW; LAGOON; TRENDS; BASIN	Estuary bays are vulnerable to salinization effects due to relative sea level rise and modification in upland hydrology owing to a variety of factors. Much research has evaluated the one-sided effect of runoff discharge or sea level on the water exchange and saltwater intrusion for an estuary, while their combined effects have not been evaluated, especially for an estuary bay with narrow river mouth. Taking the Wanquan Estuary Bay (WEB), China, as study case, this paper has revealed the long-term significant increasing trend of freshwater runoff in non-flood season during years 1956-2017 using the Man-Kendall trend analysis, robust principle component regression and Theil-Sen's estimator. A 3-D hydrodynamic-salinity-tracer numerical model is built and calibrated based on the finite-volume community ocean model, and the effects of runoff increase and sea level rise on the water exchange and saltwater intrusion are investigated. This paper shows the following: (1) The freshwater runoff during non-flood season in WEB shows significant long-term increasing trend, and the mean changing magnitude is 0.4546 m(3)/s/a. (2) The increased runoff accelerates the water exchange, and reduces the turn-over time and saltwater intrusion in the WEB. The sea level rise reduces the water exchange and increase the saltwater intrusion. (3) For the estuary bay with narrow river mouth, the salinity distributions show more vertical stratification characteristics. The freshwater runoff has power relationships with the average turnover time and salinity, and the sea level has linear relationships. (4) The water exchange and salinity of an estuary bay is more vulnerable to the changed runoff than the sea level rise, while the impacts of sea level rise would increase for estuaries with wide river mouth. This paper provides support for the freshwater exploitation and utilization in estuary bay under the background of climate change and sea level rise.

Cities offer spatial economic advantages that boost agglomeration forces and innovation, fostering further concentration of economic activities. For historic reasons urban centers cluster along coasts, which are prone to climate-induced flooding and sea level rise. To explore trade-offs between agglomeration economies and hazards increasing with climate change, we develop an evolutionary agent-based model with heterogeneous boundedly-rational agents who learn and adapt to a changing environment. The model combines migration decision of both households and firms between safe Inland and hazard-prone Coastal regions with endogenous technological learning and economic growth. Flood damages affect Coastal firms hitting their labour productivity, capital stock and inventories. We find that the model is able to replicate a rich set of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning economic and spatial dynamics. Without climate-induced shocks, the model shows how lower transport costs favour the Coastal region fueling the self-reinforcing and path-dependent agglomeration processes. We then introduce five scenarios of floods characterized by different frequency and severity to study the complex interplay of hazards with agglomeration patterns affecting the performance of the overall economy. We find that when shocks are mild or infrequent, they negatively affect the economic performance of the economy. If strong flood hazards hit frequently the Coastal region before agglomeration forces trigger high levels of the waterfront urbanization, firms and households can timely adapt and migrate landwards, thus averting the adverse impacts of climate shocks on the whole economy. Conversely, in the presence of climate tipping points where the frequency and magnitude of flood hazards abruptly intensifies, we find that economic activities remain trapped in the hazardprone region, generating lock-ins and leading to a harsh downturn of the overall economy.

The aim of the study is to provide an overview of the accident, highlighting the causes and the consequences of this compound disaster. Furthermore, the study analyses the emergency response and clean-up activities in order to identify lessons learned, and propose recommendations for future flood triggered oil spills. The work presented is based on the integration of information available in newspaper articles, government documents and reports, and data and interviews collected during two field trips in the affected area. The permanence of oil and the strong oil odour in adjacent crops as well as on irrigation canals and citizens' houses was revealed during the first field trip, about one month after the accident. The analysis of the documentation on metal working oil revealed that it might have long-lasting impact in terms of environmental pollution. The presence of oil impacted also the implemented emergency response actions, since vertical evacuation, practiced by many residents during the disaster, actually put many of them in more danger as they ended up trapped in oil-covered floodwaters with strong vapours that were reported to cause nausea and skin irritation. Remarkably, it was also found that a previous oil spill had already occurred at the same site following a severe flooding event, highlighting the need to improve preparedness and develop more effective strategies for accident prevention. Disaster preparedness that specifically considers both the natural hazard and the potential for related technological scenarios should be enhanced, in particular regarding chemical accidents triggered by floods. Japan, as well as other parts of the World, is experiencing stronger rainfall events due to a changing climate leading to unprecedented flooding. Therefore, industry, government and citizens should consider the possibility of an increase of weather-related compound disasters in planning and implementation of climate change adaptation strategies.

This study provides an understanding of the risk experienced (currently as well as back in 2001) by the districts along the Indian coastline by developing a quantitative risk index. In the process, it attempts to make a novel contribution to the risk literature by following the definition of risk as a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability as stated in the most recent (Fifth) assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Indicators of bio-physical hazards (such as cyclones, storm surge, tides and precipitation), and socio-economic contributors of vulnerability (such as infrastructure, technology, finance and social nets) and exposure (space), are combined to develop an overall risk index at a fine administrative scale of district-level over the entire coastline. Further, the study employs a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), to combine the contributing indicators and generate indices on hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The product of these three components is thereafter defined as risk. The results suggest that most districts of the eastern coast have higher risk indices compared to those in the west, and the risk has increased since 2001. The higher risk can be attributed to the higher hazard indices in the eastern districts which are aggravated by their higher vulnerability index values. This study is the first effort made to map risk for the entire coastline of India - which in turn has resulted in a new cartographic product at a district-scale. Such assessments and maps have implications for environmental and risk-managers as they can help identify the regions needing adaptive interventions.

Previous literatures have shown the usefulness of optical remote sensing in lake expansion monitoring and the effectiveness of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) in retrieving permafrost deformation on QTP. However, none of them incorporated both optical remote sensing and InSAR to investigate an event that may exhibit causal links between lake outburst and permafrost degradation. This study integrated both the Google Earth Engine (GEE) analysis on optical images and the small baseline subset (SBAS) processing on SAR datasets to evaluate the potential impact of a lake outburst event on permafrost degradation. The outburst of Zonag Lake (headwater lake) that occurred on 14 September 2011 was focused, and its consequential influence on the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake (tailwater lake) was investigated. The GEE processing on Landsat and HJ-1 imageries allowed an efficient monitoring of the Salt Lake expansion over past 20 years. In addition, the SBAS-InSAR analysis on temporal Envisat and Sentinel-1 datasets further discovered the accelerated permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake after 2014. The results provide an evidence that on QTP the outburst of a headwater lake may significantly accelerate the permafrost degradation surrounding the tailwater lake. Such degradation may be attributed to the thermal alteration of the permafrost thawing-freezing cycle and the melting ground ice, along with the subsequent changes on hydrological connectivity and soil permeability. With the continuous trend of the permafrost degradation surrounding Salt Lake, potential risks may be further exposed to the regional environment and infrastructures such as the Qinghai-Tibet railway and highway, thus deserving a particular attention in the near future. The novelties of this study are: 1) technically, the preliminary attempt to integrate the GEE and InSAR techniques for a joint analysis of lake expansion and permafrost degradation, and 2) scientifically, the finding that lake outburst may accelerate permafrost degradation on QTP.

With climate change and accelerating urbanization, flood disasters in China have increasingly affected the sustainable development of metropolitan areas. Risk assessment is an essential step in flood management and disaster mitigation, which provide a quantitative measure of flood risk. However, the difficulty of flood risk zoning is dealing with the uncertainty of the evaluation process and the complicated non-linear relationship between indicators and risk levels. To address this issue, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) method based on combined weight (CW) was utilized in this paper to generate flood risk maps at a grid-scale (1 x 1 km). For the case study in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area (BTH) in China, fourteen indicators were selected to construct the flood risk assessment model based on the FSE approach integrated with ArcGIS. The research demonstrates that moderate, high, and very high risk zones are distributed in the southeast fluvial plain of the BTH area, accounting for 31.36% of the total land area. Meanwhile, low and very-low risk zones occupy 68.64% of the total land area, and are primarily located in the high plateau and mountain regions in the northwest. We analyzed the risk level of each county and proposed risk mitigation measures based on field investigations. The verified risk assessment results were spatially consistent with the historical flood disaster records and loss positions, indicating the accuracy and reliability of the risk assessment map using the FSE approach. Compared with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) TAR (Third Assessment Report) and AR5 (Fifth Assessment Report) methods, FSE has significant advantages in handling uncertainty, complexity, and the non-linear relationship between indices and risk grades. This study provides a novel quantitative method for flood risk assessment in metropolitan areas and practical implications for urban flood management.

Artificial Neural Network Technique for Statistical Downscaling of Global Climate Model	MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Review						Climate change; Statistical downscaling; GCMs; ANN; Predictors and predictands	PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; OUTPUT	The nineteenth century, an era of industrialization, witnessed huge utilization of natural resources extensively for the construction activities besides emission of nitrous oxide and methane (green house gases). Rises in the GHG play an important role in the impact on climate change. Rapid and dynamic changes of earth climate have affected human life physically, psychologically, and emotionally. General circulation models (GCMs) are the numerical models developed using a set of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. Climate and weather forecasting reliability can be possible with the use of GCMs. Statistical downscaling is popular among the research community on an account of building a strong and accurate relationship between GCM and local level information. Among the wide range of regression models, artificial neural network (ANN), a multilinear regression method, is the most popular approach, which works on the basis of transfer function statistically relating predictors and predictands. ANN is developed particularly to address present requirements in global environmental change research and necessitate for more detailed temporal and spatial information from GCM. For the present work, CanCM4 at grid size 2.8 degrees x 2.8 degrees developed by Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis has been chosen based on the skill score. It gives historical data from 1971 to 2005 as well as the data consisted of future simulations by emission scenarios RCP4.5 from 2006 to 2035. The data were extracted to cover the entire Bhima basin with nine grid points. Observed meteorological data provided by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) are used for calibration and validation of ANN model. Karl Pearson's coefficient is taken as guideline to test the sensitiveness of predictors. To evaluate the performance of downscaling model, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and root-mean-square error performance indices have been adopted. With the good predictor and predictand correlation, the work moves on to investigate the application of the transfer function in the form of statistical downscaling. The downscaled results can be applied to watershed management such as flood and drought management studies of the Bhima basin.	[Laddimath, R.

J	Twiddy, M; Trump, B; Ramsden, S				Twiddy, Maureen; Trump, Brendan; Ramsden, Samuel			Understanding the long-term impact of flooding on the wellbeing of residents: A mixed methods study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENTAL-HEALTH	As the effects of climate change become more visible, extreme weather events are becoming more common. The effects of flooding on health are understood but the long-term impact on the well-being of those affected need to be considered. This mixed methods secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey examined the extent to which being flooded in the past is associated with ongoing concerns about flooding. Survey data were collected from residents in Hull 11 years after the initial flooding event. Respondents were asked about the floods in 2007 and their current level of concern about flooding. Ordinal logistic regression explored the effect of age and tenancy status as predictors of current concern. Textual data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Responses were received from 457 households, of whom 202 (48%) were affected by flooding in 2007. A fifth of respondents were very concerned about future flooding. Those who were not flooded were significantly less concerned about the risk of future flooding (U = 33391.0, z = 5.89, p < 0.001). Those who reported negative health and wellbeing effects from the floods were significantly more concerned about future flooding than those whose health was not affected (U = 7830.5, z = 4.43, p < 0.001). Whilst some residents were reassured by the introduction of new flood alleviation schemes, others did not feel these were adequate, and worried about the impact of climate change. The financial and emotional impacts of the floods still resonated with families 11 years after the event, with many fearing they would not cope if it happened again. Despite the 2007 floods in Hull happening over a decade ago, many of those affected continue to experience high levels of anxiety when storms are forecast. Residents feel powerless to protect themselves, and many remain unconvinced by the presence of new flood alleviation schemes. However, with the ongoing threat of climate change, it may be that other residents are unrealistic in their expectation to be 'protected' from flood events. Therefore, public health agencies need to be able to mobilize organizations to come together to pro-actively support families affected by flooding, to ensure those in need do not fall through the gaps of public healthcare delivery.

To mitigate the effects of climate change, the Chinese government has pledged to an emission reduction target that achieves a "carbon peak'" in 2030 and being "carbon neutral" in 2060 at a huge cost. In order to explore the quantitative flood risk at the county level in Qinghai province (the core province of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) and the contribution of emission reduction efforts to risk mitigation, this article constructs a loss rate curve based on the data of more than 1,000 single flood disasters from 2009 to 2019 through government cooperation and the data of observed cumulative precipitation. Combined with the latest CMIP6 climate model data, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the flood loss ratio in Qinghai province from 2020 to 2060 are quantitatively characterized. The results show the following: 1) the curve of the flood loss rate in Qinghai province from 2020 to 2060 may present a trend of "rising in the early stage, stable in the middle stage, and declining in the late stage" under low (SSP126) and medium (SSP245) emission scenarios and presents a trend of rising fluctuation under the high-emission (SSP585) scenario. The flood loss ratio under SSP585 is 10 times higher than that under SSP126; 2) the flood risk of 44 counties from 2020 to 2060 in Qinghai province may be concentrated in the southeast region, with Jiuzhi county, Banma county, Nangqian county, Gande county, and Dari county being the most prominent; (3) compared with SSP585, the Qinghai province in SSP126 may cumulatively avoid about 24 billion CNY in economic losses from 2020 to 2060 and avoid nearly 600 million CNY in losses per year, which is equivalent to 93% of Qinghai province's special funds for ecological and environmental protection in 2019. The research aims to provide theoretical and data support for flood disaster risk prevention and management in China's high-altitude areas and to promote the initiative of emission reduction in China and even the world.

The strategic deployment of emergency frames by proponents of sustainability action aims to stimulate collective action on issues for which it is lacking. But this is contentious due to a range of possible effects. We critically review interdisciplinary social science literature to examine the political effects of emergency frames in sustainability and develop a typology of five key dimensions of variation. This pinpoints practical areas for evaluating the utility of emergency frames and builds a shared vocabulary for analysis and decision-making. Emergency frames in sustainability debates can stimulate collective action on issues for which it is lacking but can have consequences. This Review examines the political effects of emergency frames in sustainability and develops a typology of different effects to build a shared vocabulary for analysis and decision-making.

Spatial and temporal scaling of sub-daily extreme rainfall for data sparse places	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Regional climate downscaling; Extreme rainfall; Intensity-duration-frequency; Tropics; Flood	DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES; STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING MODEL; DAILY PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IDF CURVES; FUTURE PROJECTIONS; INTENSITY; RESOLUTION; IMPACT; SDSM	Global efforts to upgrade water, drainage, and sanitation services are hampered by hydrometeorological data-scarcity plus uncertainty about climate change. Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) tables are used routinely to design water infrastructure so offer an entry point for adapting engineering standards. This paper begins with a novel procedure for guiding downscaling predictor variable selection for heavy rainfall simulation using media reports of pluvial flooding. We then present a three-step workflow to: (1) spatially downscale daily rainfall from grid-to-point resolutions; (2) temporally scale from daily series to sub-daily extreme rainfalls and; (3) test methods of temporal scaling of extreme rainfalls within Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations under changed climate conditions. Critically, we compare the methods of moments and of parameters for temporal scaling annual maximum series of daily rainfall into sub-daily extreme rainfalls, whilst accounting for rainfall intermittency. The methods are applied to Kampala, Uganda and Kisumu, Kenya using the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM), two RCM simulations covering East Africa (CP4 and P25), and in hybrid form (RCM-SDSM). We demonstrate that Gumbel parameters (and IDF tables) can be reliably scaled to durations of 3 h within observations and RCMs. Our hybrid RCM-SDSM scaling reduces errors in IDF estimates for the present climate when compared with direct RCM output. Credible parameter scaling relationships are also found within RCM simulations under changed climate conditions. We then discuss the practical aspects of applying such workflows to other city-regions.	[Wilby, R. L.; Yu, D.] Loughborough Univ, Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Dawson, C.

Managed realignment (MR), a coastal adaptation strategy that entails the landward realignment of coastal defences to restore coastal habitats (often salt marshes), plays a pivotal role in implementing nature-based solutions in the coastal zone. Across Europe, more than 130 sites have been implemented so far, often to harness their potential to mitigate coastal flood risks while restoring coastal habitats (ABPmer, 2021). However, local communities often oppose MR projects, not only because they are seen as returning hard-won land to the sea but also because their coastal protection function is less trusted than traditional hard engineering techniques. This scepticism has foundation. The proclaimed coastal protection function of MRs is based on a broad body of literature on the protective function of natural salt marshes. However, contrary to natural salt marshes, MRs are often semi-enclosed tidal basins with narrow breaches to the open sea/estuary. Recent studies indicate that MR-internal hydrodynamics may significantly reduce their coastal protection, depending on their engineering design. To successfully implement MR, a much-improved scientific knowledge base is needed, as well as a process for addressing community concerns and genuinely engaging stakeholders in decision-making beyond the usual obligatory consultancy approach. Here, we propose the co-production of scientific knowledge with local communities and stakeholders to optimize the success of coastal nature-based solutions and promote community acceptance.

Despite significant improvements in the modeling of flood hazard and exposure, compelling evidence of the spatial and temporal patterns of social vulnerability around the world is still lacking. In this study, a global flood vulnerability (FV) framework that simultaneously considers exposure, sensitivity, and coping capacity was developed. Then, the spatiotemporal distribution of the FV was determined based on game theory (GT), and the FV value was integrated with the regional integrated FV grades (RIFVG) at the global, continental, and national scales. The results reveal that: (1) The global FV exhibits a U-shaped trend, i.e., decreasing and then increasing (RIFVG changing from 1.1643 to 1.1542, 1.1491, and 1.1795) during 2005-2020; (2) Great spatial heterogeneity exists between continents. Specifically, Asia and Europe are the two continents with the highest RIFVG values, and the losses to floods may rise significantly in Africa in the future; (3) The high vulnerability areas are mainly distributed in areas and countries with dense populations and developed economies (i.e., eastern China and northern India). In addition, more than half of the 20 countries with the highest RIFVG values are developed countries; (4) As the frequency and magnitude of global floods are likely to increase under climate change, significant inequalities between low-income and high-income countries remain and even deepen. The results of this study can provide scientific and technological basis for decision makers to formulate disaster prevention and mitigation policies.

Investigating factors that affect tidal marsh accretion and elevation change is important, largely due to accelerating sea-level rise and the ecological and economic value of wetlands. Sediment accumulation rates, elevation change, and flooding were examined at five marshes along a riverine-tidal gradient in the northern San Francisco Bay-Delta, California, USA during an Atmospheric River storm event in 2017 using Surface Elevation Tables (SETs), feldspar marker horizons (MH), and continuous water-level sensors. Our results showed that localized marsh flooding increased during the storm event, but not evenly across sites. Marsh surface elevation increased the most at the tidal freshwater marsh site in response to the storms, with an average surface elevation gain of 45.6 +/- 13.1 mm, and the least at a tidal saline marsh with an average surface elevation gain of 4.0 +/- 1.2 mm. A marsh located on the large embayment did not exhibit an immediate response to the storm but had a surface elevation gain of 21.5 +/- 13.7 mm 6 months after the storm. During the storm period, marsh distance to the bay was the strongest predictor of elevation change, followed by SET-MH elevations. Conversely, during non-storm periods, SET-MH elevation was a relatively strong predictor of elevation change. Atmospheric Rivers appear to be a major factor affecting short-term spatial and temporal variability in flooding and sedimentation rates in tidal marsh systems. Incorporating information about storms into monitoring could increase our understanding of how episodic storms can impact marshes.

Here, regional ocean climate models (RCMs) that consider tides were used to address these limitations in the Northwest Pacific marginal seas through dynamical downscaling. Four GCMs that drive the RCMs were selected based on a performance evaluation along the RCM boundaries, and the latter were validated by comparing historical results with observations. High-resolution (1/20 degrees) RCMs were used to project non-uniform changes in the sea-level under intermediate (RCP 4.5) and high-end emissions (RCP 8.5) scenarios from 2006 to 2100. The predicted local sea-level rise was higher in the East/Japan Sea (EJS), where the currents and eddy motions were active. The tidal amplitude changes in response to sea-level rise were significant in the shallow areas of the Yellow Sea (YS). Dynamically downscaled simulations enabled the determination of practical sea-level rise (PSLR), including changes in tidal amplitude and natural variability. Under RCP 8.5 scenario, the maximum PSLR was similar to 85 cm in the YS and East China Sea (ECS), and similar to 78 cm in the EJS. The contribution of natural sea-level variability changes in the EJS was greater than that in the YS and ECS, whereas changes in the tidal contribution were higher in the YS and ECS. Accordingly, high-resolution RCMs provided spatially different PSLR estimates, indicating the importance of improving model resolution for local sea-level projections in marginal seas.

Concurrently, development along wildland-urban interfaces has increased. Thus, quantification of post-fire hazards, such as debris flows and their triggering rainfall conditions, is critical for effective emergency response. We monitored the hydrologic and geomorphic responses of 10 recently burned watersheds in the areas impacted by the 2018 Ferguson Fire and the 2019 Briceburg Fire in the lower Merced River Canyon near Yosemite National Park, CA. During our monitoring, which spanned the period between November 2018 and May 2020, our study basins produced 26 debris flows in response to 60 rainstorms. The corresponding peak rainfall intensity data were used to establish empirically derived rainfall intensity-duration thresholds for debris-flow initiation for these burned areas. First-year data revealed objectively defined 15-minute-duration rainfall intensity thresholds of approximately 31 and 35 mm/hr for the Ferguson and Briceburg fires, respectively. Given the small sample size and the bimodal distribution of 15-minute-duration peak rainfall intensities observed, the objectively defined threshold may be only partially constrained. When compared to modeled estimates of spatially explicit thresholds, the objectively defined debris-flow thresholds in our analysis were higher. When compared to empirically derived thresholds from other regions, our empirical values fell in the middle of the range. This study suggests that model refinement or development of a regionally specific model may be warranted to provide more accurate information for use in emergency management decisions, potentially reducing unnecessary impacts to the public.

In spite of this, the quantitative identification of FWS classification so far remains elusive. In this study, we quantitatively examined the typical matching patterns of FWS based on flood peak magnitude and timing between the upstream and tributary discharge, to evaluate the flood severity for both present-day conditions and future climate projections. The future FWS projection was realized using hydrological modeling coupled with multiple outputs of global climate models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios. A triple point of discharge stations, including upstream, downstream and tributary stations, located at a river confluence of the Poyang Lake Basin, China, was selected as the study area. The results revealed that the frequency of perfect temporal matching (0-day time lag) of projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods increased from 61% in the reference period to >68% and > 66% in the future under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. Furthermore, both the future numbers and frequencies of the projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods with both perfect temporal and magnitude matching (the classification associated with the most damage in FWS) would substantially increase across all GCMs under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5. These findings indicate that future FWS is expected to experience increasing severity due to the changing climate under no matter RCP 2.6 or 8.5 emission scenarios. Overall, it is suggested that effective adaptation strategies be developed in order to stagger the timing of upstream and tributary floods in the future.

How Do Climate and Catchment Attributes Influence Flood Generating Processes? A Large-Sample Study for 671 Catchments Across the Contiguous USA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						accumulated local effects; catchment attributes; climate; flood generating process; interpretable machine learning; large sample	RAIN-ON-SNOW; RUNOFF GENERATION; GLOBAL EVIDENCE; DATA SET; VARIABILITY; EVENTS; SOIL; PATTERNS; FOREST; RISK	Hydrometeorological flood generating processes (excess rain, short rain, long rain, snowmelt, and rain-on-snow) underpin our understanding of flood behavior. Knowledge about flood generating processes improves hydrological models, flood frequency analysis, estimation of climate change impact on floods, etc. Yet, not much is known about how climate and catchment attributes influence the spatial distribution of flood generating processes. This study aims to offer a comprehensive and structured approach to close this knowledge gap. We employ a large sample approach (671 catchments across the contiguous United States) and evaluate how catchment attributes and climate attributes influence the distribution of flood processes. We use two complementary approaches: A statistics-based approach which compares attribute frequency distributions of different flood processes; and a random forest model in combination with an interpretable machine learning approach (accumulated local effects [ALE]). The ALE method has not been used often in hydrology, and it overcomes a significant obstacle in many statistical methods, the confounding effect of correlated catchment attributes. As expected, we find climate attributes (fraction of snow, aridity, precipitation seasonality, and mean precipitation) to be most influential on flood process distribution. However, the influence of catchment attributes varies both with flood generating process and climate type. We also find flood processes can be predicted for ungauged catchments with relatively high accuracy (R-2 between 0.45 and 0.9). The implication of these findings is flood processes should be considered for future climate change impact studies, as the effect of changes in climate on flood characteristics varies between flood processes.

Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries' systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture.

J	Zhang, Y; Najafi, MR				Zhang, Ying; Najafi, Mohammad Reza			Probabilistic Numerical Modeling of Compound Flooding Caused by Tropical Storm Matthew Over a Data-Scarce Coastal Environment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						compound flooding; Saint Lucia; climate change; LISFLOOD&#8208; FP; data scarcity; infrastructure risk	SEA-LEVEL RISE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; EXTREME RAINFALL; SHALLOW-WATER; SURGE; RIVER; UNCERTAINTY; RESOLUTION; PRECIPITATION; DEPENDENCE	The passage of a tropical storm, as the main driver of storm surge and high waves in many coastal regions, can also generate heavy rainfall and cause river overflow. The resulting combination of riverine, pluvial, and coastal flood hazard can result in catastrophic losses particularly in densely populated coastal environments. In this study, we characterize compound flooding caused by Tropical Storm Matthew and assess the significance and associated uncertainties of multiple contributing factors over a data-scarce coastal region. A hydrological model combined with a simplified two-dimensional hydrodynamic model are set up and validated to investigate the compounding effects of storm tide, wave runup, rainfall, and river overflow at the southern coast of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean Sea. Pleiades-1 and Sentinel-1 satellite imageries are used to determine the flood-impacted areas. The analyses are performed based on deterministic and probabilistic approaches and the effects of uncertain boundary conditions and model parameters are investigated. Results show that the individual analysis of flood hazards, in isolation, can lead to substantial underestimation of flood risks. Heavy rainfall and wave runup are the most significant contributors to compound flooding in Saint Lucia. In addition, the interactions between seawater and streamflow can exacerbate riverine flood hazards particularly upstream of the river mouth. Communities in western Vieux Fort, and the Hewanorra International Airport, have high exposure to compound flooding, which is projected to intensify under climate change.

J	Heesterman, ARG				Heesterman, Aart Reinier Gustaaf			Containing the risk of catastrophic climate change	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CARBON CAPTURE; DIOXIDE; BIOGAS	There is a general perception that limiting emissions of carbon dioxide will be sufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change. The reality could well be that the many of the world's wealthy coastal cities which historically developed as ports will be inundated repeatedly to disappear eventually below the sea, with large swathes of the earth being flooded. Other major conurbations may cease to be liveable without air conditioning, while large numbers of people could well starve as a result of disruption of ecosystems. To the extent that this possibility is recognized, it is nevertheless perceived as a gradual process with the worst results in a distance future with any sea-level rise a gradual process. Limiting emissions is unlikely to be sufficient, because the level of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is now much higher than ever before since humans started to exploit fossil fuels. We know this from the study of ancient air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores. There is a lack of balance between the energy transmitted by the incoming sunlight and the earth's outgoing infrared heat radiation. So far this imbalance is absorbed by the enormous thermal mass of the oceans. As to the speed of sea-level rise, a period of extremely rapid sea-level rise of about 1.4 cm per year has occurred in the prehistoric past and disintegration of ice sheets as is happening currently may well be a plausible explanation of this fact. In fact, it is straightforward to create substantial amounts of negative emissions of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, making it happen will require an unprecedented degree of global cooperation, a high level of taxation on the extraction of coal and crude oil, and the use of pressurized liquid petrol gas as aviation fuel.

Only 2.5% of all the water on Earth is freshwater and can be used to meet basic human needs such as a clean supply of water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Water scarcity is the result of an imbalance between supply and demand. Efficient water resource management is definitely of interest to research and is a practical topic. At the same time, water-related disasters such as floods and droughts cause the loss of life and property. Disasters increase the difficulty of effective water resource management. An increase in climate extremes can also increase the risk of floods and droughts. This overview covers 150 peer-reviewed journal publications from the last twenty years focusing on risk-reduction strategies for floods and droughts. First, a definition and classification of flood and drought was introduced. Second, studies and techniques associated with risk reduction were grouped into three themes and discussed: prediction and warning; monitoring; and impact assessment, response, and management. As a result, many studies were solely focused on, and achieve excellence in, their own themes. Special attention was needed to find in these studies what can convert the adverse impacts such as flood water to positive outcomes such as drought relief. Multidisciplinary cooperation is necessary to achieve sustainability and to adapt to climate change. Finally, advanced techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) were foreseen to have a tremendous impact on future disaster risk reduction.

Methods Semistructured interviews were held with regional strategic decision makers and local service managers within 1 km of the recorded flood outline to ascertain their experiences, views and reflections concerning the event and its associated health impacts and disruption to health care services. A snowballing sampling technique was used to ensure the study had participants across a broad range of expertise. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data analysis was preformed using NVivo (v10) to apply a thematic coding and develop a framework of ideas. Results The results of this case study provide a vital insight into the health care disruption caused by flooding. All sectors of the health care system suffered disruption, which placed a strain on the whole system and reduced the capacity of the sector to respond to the health consequences of flooding and delivering routine health care. The formal recovery phase in Lincolnshire was stood-down on 4th February 2014. The results of this work indicate limitations in preparedness of the health care system for the reasonable worse-case scenario for an east coast surge event. Conclusions The health care sector appears to have limited capacity to respond to weather-related impacts and is therefore unprepared for the risks associated with a future changing climate. Further work is required to ensure that the health care system continues to review and learn from such events to increase climate resilience.

This is especially important in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), where poverty and vulnerability are high and climate change impacts on the cryosphere are strong. However, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge about the contributions of the cryosphere to high mountain communities. This paper uses a cryosphere service frameworka derivative of the ecosystem service conceptto classify different goods and services provided by the cryosphere. Case studies were selected using an adapted systematic review methodology. These studies were then synthesized and examined through the lens of critical political ecology. The review shows that while the cryosphere provides a whole range of goods and services for mountain communities, not all of these are well documented. Material services like the supply of water for irrigation and agriculture, and disservices such as disasters, are better documented than non-material services like the spirituality of landscapes. The majority of the case studies do not use an interdisciplinary lens. While some studies on irrigation discuss the physical basis and human organization of irrigation, the literature on disasters mostly focuses on the physical processes and at most generalized loss and damage assessments. Further, most case studies do not use the critical epistemologies needed to examine how politics, power, and intersectionality influence societal responses to changes in the cryosphere. The paper suggests that future studies adopt interdisciplinary collaboration to understand human impacts and adaptive responses through critical political ecology frameworks.

South-western Amazonia is covered by an extensive seasonally flooded savannah, known as the Llanos de Moxos. Severe drought during the southern hemisphere winter, followed by months of permanent waterlogging, means that forests only grow on the most elevated parts of the landscape, mostly river and paleoriver levees and crevasse splays. Paleoclimate reconstructions from surrounding areas show that a shift to wetter conditions at around 4 kyr BP caused an increase in forest cover. However, the impact that this change in climate had on the landscape of the Llanos de Moxos is unknown. Published lacustrine archives from the area only cover the last 2 kyr. Here we present new data from the analysis of paleosols located along a 300 km transect across the central Llanos. The analyses of stable carbon isotopes, from 36 paleosols, and biogenic silica, from 29 paleosols, show that the patchwork of forests and savannahs that we see today was established after the 4 kyr BP climate change. During the dry period between 8 and 4 kyr BP, most of the central Llanos de Moxos, nowadays covered with seasonally flooded savannah, were covered by Cerrado-like savannah in the west and by forest in the east. However, results also suggest that, at both regional and local scales, vegetation cover has been influenced by changes in topography resulting from the region's river dynamics.

However, due to sea-level rise, what communities in the United States now experience as the highest, lowest, and average water levels on a typical day no longer corresponds to the official definitions of high tide, low tide, and mean sea level, respectively. Water levels now regularly exceed official high tide along parts of the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf Coast, and Puerto Rico. In other words, yesterday's high tide is becoming today's new normal. This demonstrates how sea-level rise is radically redefining the American shore.

An agent-based model for evaluating reforms of the National Flood Insurance Program: A benchmarked model applied to Jamaica Bay, NYC	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						affordability; agent-based model; disaster risk reduction; dynamic adaptive behavior; flood insurance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; EXPERIENCE; DECISIONS; RESIDENTS; PATHWAYS; PREMIUMS; BEHAVIOR	Coastal flood risk is expected to increase as a result of climate change effects, such as sea level rise, and socioeconomic growth. To support policymakers in making adaptation decisions, accurate flood risk assessments that account for the influence of complex adaptation processes on the developments of risks are essential. In this study, we integrate the dynamic adaptive behavior of homeowners within a flood risk modeling framework. Focusing on building-level adaptation and flood insurance, the agent-based model (DYNAMO) is benchmarked with empirical data for New York City, USA. The model simulates the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and frequently proposed reforms to evaluate their effectiveness. The model is applied to a case study of Jamaica Bay, NY. Our results indicate that risk-based premiums can improve insurance penetration rates and the affordability of insurance compared to the baseline NFIP market structure. While a premium discount for disaster risk reduction incentivizes more homeowners to invest in dry-floodproofing measures, it does not significantly improve affordability. A low interest rate loan for financing risk-mitigation investments improves the uptake and affordability of dry-floodproofing measures. The benchmark and sensitivity analyses demonstrate how the behavioral component of our model matches empirical data and provides insights into the underlying theories and choices that autonomous agents make.

This feature will be essential for plants to survive climate changes characterized by extreme temperatures and rainfall. Although plants require molecular oxygen (O-2) to live, they can overcome transient low-O-2 conditions (hypoxia) until return to standard 21% O-2 atmospheric conditions (normoxia). After heavy rainfall, submerged plants in flooded lands undergo transient hypoxia until water recedes and normoxia is recovered. The accumulated information on the physiological and molecular events occurring during the hypoxia phase contrasts with the limited knowledge on the reoxygenation process after hypoxia, which has often been overlooked in many studies in plants. Phenotypic alterations during recovery are due to potentiated oxidative stress generated by simultaneous reoxygenation and reillumination leading to cell damage. Besides processes such as N-degron proteolytic pathway-mediated O-2 sensing, or mitochondria-driven metabolic alterations, other molecular events controlling gene expression have been recently proposed as key regulators of hypoxia and reoxygenation. RNA regulatory functions, chromatin remodeling, protein synthesis, and post-translational modifications must all be studied in depth in the coming years to improve our knowledge on hypoxia-reoxygenation transition in plants, a topic with relevance in agricultural biotechnology in the context of global climate change.

Coastal wetlands mitigate storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						saltmarsh; storm surge attenuation; wave attenuation; flood mitigation; nature-based coastal protection; coastal storms	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SALT MARSHES; TROPICAL CYCLONES; WAVE ATTENUATION; SURGE; RISK; TIDE; VALIDATION; PROTECTION; EMERGENT	As storm-driven coastal flooding increases under climate change, wetlands such as saltmarshes are held as a nature-based solution. Yet evidence supporting wetlands' storm protection role in estuaries-where both waves and upstream surge drive coastal flooding-remains scarce. Here we address this gap using numerical hydrodynamic models within eight contextually diverse estuaries, simulating storms of varying intensity and coupling flood predictions to damage valuation. Saltmarshes reduced flooding across all studied estuaries and particularly for the largest-100 year-storms, for which they mitigated average flood extents by 35% and damages by 37% ($8.4 M). Across all storm scenarios, wetlands delivered mean annual damage savings of $2.7 M per estuary, exceeding annualised values of better studied wetland services such as carbon storage. Spatial decomposition of processes revealed flood mitigation arose from both localised wave attenuation and estuary-scale surge attenuation, with the latter process dominating: mean flood reductions were 17% in the sheltered top third of estuaries, compared to 8% near wave-exposed estuary mouths. Saltmarshes therefore play a generalised role in mitigating storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries via multi-scale processes. Ecosystem service modelling must integrate processes operating across scales or risk grossly underestimating the value of nature-based solutions to the growing threat of storm-driven coastal flooding.

However, anthropogenic and climate changes have greatly impacted the probabilistic behavior of these extremes and have challenged the stationarity assumption of the marginal distributions of individual characteristics of the extremes as well as their dependence structure inherent in copula-based modeling. This study developed a dynamic copula-based multivariate risk analysis model (DCM) to analyze seasonal flood extremes (MWLandAMS), observed at Yichang Station in Yangtze River basin, China. The model entailed three parts: (1) Time-varying moment models, combined with log-likelihood ratio tests, were employed to explore whether the trend-caused nonstationarity existed in the marginal distributions or the dependence structure of the seasonal flood extremes; (2) a nonstationary multivariate probability distribution was developed using a dynamic marginal and copula-based model, incorporating different large-scale climate forcings (NAO, SOI, and NINO3.4), meteorological factor (rainfall and temperature) and reservoir index as covariates; and (3) flood hazard was quantified using the multivariate hazard model. The climate-related nonstationarity-based multivariate frequency model through the incorporation of climatic indices would help predict the hazard level of a certain quantile pair for the next year of the observed period.

China is the most populous country, and populations in its LECZ grew rapidly due to urbanization and remarkable economic growth in coastal areas. In assessing the potential impacts of coastal hazards, the spatial distribution of population exposure in China's LECZ should be examined. In this study, we propose a combination of multisource remote sensing images, point-of-interest data, and machine learning methods to improve the performance of population disaggregation in coastal China. The resulting population grid map of coastal China for the reference year 2010, with a spatial resolution of 100 x 100 m, is presented and validated. Then, we analyze the distribution of population in LECZ by overlaying the new gridded population data and LECZ footprints. Results showed that the total population exposed in China's LECZ in 2010 was 158.2 million (random forest prediction) and 160.6 million (Cubist prediction), which account for 12.17% and 12.36% of the national population, respectively. This study also showed the considerable potential in combining geospatial big data for high-resolution population estimation.

Daily resolution alpine climate data from Switzerland covering an elevation range of over 3,000m between 1981 and 2017 have been analysed using highly resolved trends in order to gain a better understanding of features, forcings and feedbacks related to temperature changes in mountainous regions. Particular focus is put on processes related to changes in weather types, incoming solar radiation, cloud cover, air humidity, snow/ice and elevation dependency of temperature trends. Temperature trends in Switzerland differ depending on the time of the year, day and elevation. Warming is strongest during spring and early summer with enhanced warming of daytime maximum temperatures. Elevation-based differences in temperature trends occur during autumn and winter with stronger warming at lower elevations. We attribute this elevation-dependent temperature signal mainly to elevation-based differences in trends of incoming solar radiation and elevation-sensitive responses to changes in frequencies of weather types. In general, effects of varying frequencies of weather types overlap with trends caused by transmission changes in short- and long-wave radiation. Temperature signals arising from snow/ice albedo feedback mechanisms are probably small and might be hidden by other effects.

In the case of Villa del Mar, there is an increase in strong swell, making this a high visibility problematic zone. This work analyses the effects of recurrent and strong waves in urbanized coastal lands highly visited by tourists (Avenida Pert, Poblacion Vergara, Vina del Mar), and the perception of security of inhabitants and tourists. By historical wave data analysis, a significant event survey, and a safety perception survey, this work high-lights the negative impact of these events over the urban infrastructure located next to the coastal line, including urban furniture, residences, hotels, cars and stores in the last decades. A negative safety perception on infrastructure and coastal defenses performance was found, as well as a strong need to adapt the infrastructure to reduce vulnerability. The analyzed infrastructure has not been adapted to the risk of floods. This situation warns of the obsolescence of predominant typologies, which are constantly affected either in winter or summer times. Some solutions as the incorporation of new flood-adapted building typologies, relocate critical infrastructure and services, incorporate soft coastal defenses solutions, together with a reinforcement of codes, are discussed in order to reduce the effects of future extreme wind wave events.

Temporal/spatial changes from 2002 to 2016 in the terrestrial water storage (TWS) and the groundwater storage (GWS) were analyzed, based on RL06 Mascon data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, and the sum of soil water content, snow water equivalent and canopy water data that were obtained from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Combing meteorological data and land use and cover change (LUCC) data, the joint impact of both human activities and climate change on the terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) and the groundwater storage change (GWSC) was evaluated by statistical analysis. The results revealed three findings: (1) The TWS retrieved by CSR (Center for Space Research) and the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) showed a decreasing trend in the three basins, and the variation of TWS showed a maximum surplus in spring (March-May) and a maximum deficit in autumn (September-November). (2) The decreasing rates of groundwater storage that were extracted, based on JPL and CSR Mascon data sets, were -2.17 mm/year and -3.90 mm/year, -3.72 mm/year and -4.96 mm/year, -1.74 mm/year and -3.36 mm/year in the Amu Darya river basin, Syr Darya river basin and Balkhash lake basin, respectively. (3) In the Amu Darya river basin, annual precipitation showed a decreasing trend, while the evapotranspiration rate showed an increasing trend due to an increasing temperature, and the TWS decreased from 2002 to 2016 in most areas of the basin. However, in the middle reaches of the Amu Darya river basin, the TWS increased due to the increase in cultivated land area, water income from flooded irrigation, and reservoir impoundment. In the upper reaches of the Syr Darya river basin, the increase in precipitation in alpine areas leads to an increase in glacier and snow meltwater, which is the reason for the increase in the TWS. In the middle and lower reaches of the Syr Darya river basin, the amount of evapotranspiration dissipation exceeds the amount of water replenished by agricultural irrigation, which leads to a decrease in TWS and GWS. The increase in precipitation in the northwest of the Balkhash lake basin, the increase in farmland irrigation water, and the topography (higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest) led to an increase in TWS and GWS in the northwest of the Balkhash lake basin. This study can provide useful information for water resources management in the inland river basins of Central Asia.

J	Serur, AB				Serur, Abdulkerim Bedewi			Climate change under CMIP5-RCP scenarios in Ethiopia: The Bale mountains ecoregion	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change and variability; CMIP5-ESMs-RCP scenarios; SDSM; Bale mountains ecoregion; Ethiopia	RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION; AVAILABILITY; SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; FORMULATION; AFRICA; MODELS; IMPACT	The Bale mountains ecoregion in Ethiopia provides a number of benefits for the local communities mainly in terms of water supply, power generation, tourism activity, and irrigation development. Not with standing, the ecoregion has been characterized primarily by recurring floods and droughts, as well as crop failure due to a variety of natural and human-activity-driven change factors. As a matter of fact, the purpose of this study would be to examine long-term changes and fluctuation in precipitation (PCP), maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature (T-min) in the Bale mountains ecoregion using ensembles of three climate models with three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios from the coupled model inter-comparison project phase five (CMIP5) dataset. Statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was applied to project PCP, T-max, and T-min in the forthcoming period considering three RCPs: low emission (RCP2.6), intermediate (RCP4.5), and high emission (RCP8.5). SDSM's performance in capturing historical daily PCP, T-max, and T-min has been validated using standard statistical metrics such as coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). SDSM has the potential to generate a statistical transfer function between large-scale variables and local climate, allowing PCP, T-max, and T-min to be downscaled to a point scale for the ecoregion. The magnitude of mean yearly changes in PCP, T-max, and T-min were investigated throughout three thirty-year time slices, corresponding to the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was used to analyse trends in PCP, T-max, and T-min from 2011 to 2100. Inter-annual variability in PCP, T-max, and T-min were investigated for the aforementioned period, taking standard deviation into account under each RCP scenarios. The results reveal that mean annual PCP, T-max, and T-min are rising in all three time slices and in all three CMIP5 RCP scenarios as compared to the baseline scenario. Mean annual PCP is projected to increase within the uncertainty range of 6.68% to 17.93% (RCP2.6), 7.45% to 21.94% (RCP4.5), and 19.70% to 33.69% (RCP4.5) (RCP8.5). T-max increases from 0.04 degrees C to 0.24 degrees C (RCP2.6), 0.05 degrees C to 0.31 degrees C (RCP4.5), and 0.04 degrees C to 0.42 degrees C (RCP8.5), whereas T-min increases from 0.22 degrees C to 0.52 degrees C (RCP2.6), 0.23 degrees C to 0.67 degrees C (RCP4.5), and 0.26 degrees C to 1.14 degrees C (RCP8.5) (RCP8.5). For future projections at the end of the 21(st) century, the mean annual PCP, T-max, and T-min for all three analysed climate models and RCPs have shown a positive trend. The inter-annual variability of PCP, T-max, and T-min is higher in the RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 in all climate models. The findings clearly implied that prior understanding of long-term climate change and variability need to be addressed to plan effective and efficient mitigation strategies, as well as to maintain adequate quantity and quality of water supplies to the communities residing in the ecoregion.

Range size is one of the most important criteria for determining species conservation status. It is an outcome of multiple factors, including a species' ecological tolerance and propensity to disperse, availability and temporal stability of suitable habitat patches, and between-patch connectivity. Understanding the determinants of range size could help identify the main threats, which may differ among species. 2. Subterranean species typically have smaller ranges than their surface counterparts. However, the determinants of their ranges are poorly known. The aim of this study was to test three potential determinants of species range size (habitat type, body size, and species age) using the species of the amphipod genus Niphargus. The study was performed within the Dinarides (south-east Europe), a global subterranean hotspot. 3. The only significant determinant of range size was the habitat in which the species lived. The species with the smallest ranges inhabit fissure systems in the upper layers of the carbonate massifs with predominantly vertical water flow. The species with the largest ranges live in the deepest zone - the permanently flooded phreatic with lateral water flow. These results imply that differences in connectivity among habitats determine the range sizes of aquatic subterranean species. 4. The vertical gradient in habitat connectivity indicates the vulnerability of the species to climate change. Desertification and longer periods of drought will probably have a greater effect on fauna in fissures than in the phreatic zone. In addition, lowering the groundwater table might exacerbate the fragmentation of intermediate habitats, possibly enhancing local extinction. 5. The habitat ecology of subterranean species should be considered in International Union for Conservation of Nature assessments. Given that the most narrowly distributed aquatic subterranean species live in habitats subjected to climatic drying, the protection of subterranean fauna depends on the management of surface habitats such as forests.

However, at present, sponge city construction is still in its exploratory stage. It is still not clear which models are capable of simulating the six key processes (i.e., "retention," "infiltration," "storage," "purification," "discharge," and "utilization") of sponge city practices. Its various benefits (e.g., social, economic and environmental benefits) have not yet been systematically investigated in the context of the sponge city. In this study, we reviewed and compared 19 urban stormwater management models (including 13 hydrological models and 10 decision-support tools, as there are 4 overlap ones) and investigated their application in China. Firstly, we examined the mechanisms behind the hydrological models and compared the abilities of the models to simulate various processes. Secondly, we analyzed what kinds of benefits can be addressed by these decision support tools (DSTs). Finally, we discussed the applications and limitations of the models in various climate zones in China. The findings suggest that none of the models consider the impact of climate change on the sponge city practices (SCP) and none of DSTs can simulate the negative performance of SCP. Furthermore, the lack of sufficient databases in China limited the applications of many of the models. Additionally, we found that the hydrological processes corresponding to "storage" were given more attention in southern China, and "infiltration" of stormwater was of greater concern in northern China. In the context of sponge city construction, this paper provides suggestions for future model development of urban stormwater management in China, such as the development of a stormwater database and the incorporation of long-term climate change impacts into the model.

Temporal dynamics of Chironomid (Diptera) diversity under flood-drought pulses in a shallow tropical floodplain lake	LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Aquatic insect; Water-level fluctuations; Hydrological pulse; Climate change; Beta diversity	PARANA RIVER FLOODPLAIN; BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES; BETA DIVERSITY; IVINHEMA RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; ASSEMBLAGES; VARIABILITY; HABITATS	The water-level regime is a major determinant of the community structure in river-floodplain systems. Chironomidae is a highly diverse insect family that plays a key role in the trophic structure and functioning of floodplain systems. However, we know little about how water-level oscillations affect the chironomid structure. Using a 9-year database, we investigated how the richness, density, and temporal beta-diversity of chironomid larvae are affected by water-level oscillations and environmental variables in a tropical lake. We tested the hypotheses that (i) in high-water-level periods, the Chironomidae community is more similar (homogeneous) among sites within the lake; (ii) in low-water-level periods, the Chironomidae community is more variable, and that this is likely because (iii) the importance of environmental filtering is stronger in low-water-level periods than in high-water-level periods. We found a hump-shaped relationship between chironomid richness and density with water level, and a monotonic negative relationship between chironomid beta-diversity and water level over the years. Chironomidae composition was structured by water-level oscillations during the high-water-level period, whereas during the low-water-level period, environmental filtering was the most important structuring factor. In addition, Chironomidae density and richness decreased in high- and low-water-level periods compared to intermediate-water-level periods, and temporal Chironomidae beta-diversity increased in low-water-level periods and decreased in high-water-level periods. Our findings are important considering that extreme climatic events tend to increase in frequency and intensity in the future, which may increase the frequency of extreme low- and high-water-level periods in floodplain systems.

J	Agnew, D; Fryirs, KA; Ralph, TJ; Kobayashi, T				Agnew, Danelle; Fryirs, Kirstie A.; Ralph, Timothy J.; Kobayashi, Tsuyoshi			Soil carbon dynamics and aquatic metabolism of a wet-dry tropics wetland system	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Seasonal freshwater wetland; Wetland conservation; Carbon sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Ecosystem productivity; Geomorphology	FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; ORGANIC-CARBON; PANTANAL WETLAND; UPLAND SWAMPS; COSTA-RICA; FOOD WEBS; FLOODPLAIN; RIVER; ECOSYSTEM	Freshwater wetlands are a key component of the global carbon cycle. Wet-dry tropics wetlands function as wet-season carbon sinks and dry-season carbon sources with low aquatic metabolism controlled by predictably seasonal, yet magnitude-variable flow regimes and inundation patterns. However, these dynamics have not been adequately quantified in Australia's relatively unmodified wet-dry tropics freshwater wetlands. A baseline understanding is required before analysis of land-use or climate change impacts on these aquatic ecosystems can occur. This study characterises geomorphology and sedimentology within a seasonally connected wet-dry tropics freshwater wetland system at Kings Plains, Queensland, Australia, and quantifies soil carbon stocks and wet- and dry-season aquatic metabolism. Soil carbon stocks derived from loss-on-ignition on samples to 1 m depth were 51.5 +/- 7.8 kg C m(-2), higher than other wet-dry tropics wetlands globally, with potential for long-term retention at greater depths. Gross primary productivity of phytoplankton (GPP) and planktonic respiration (PR) measured through biological oxygen demand bottle experiments in the water column of sediment inundated under laboratory conditions show overall low GPP and PR in both wet- and dry-season samples (all wetland samples were heterotrophic with GPP/PR < 1). Despite the short-term dominance of aquatic respiration processes leading to net release of carbon in the water column under these conditions, there is appreciable long-term storage of carbon in sediment in the Kings Plains wetlands. This demonstrates the importance of wet-dry-tropics wetland systems as hotspots of carbon sequestration, locally, regionally and globally, and consideration should be given to their conservation and management in this context.

The areas with the highest share of sediment loads are tracked to establish possible indications for future catchment management plans. Materials and methods Analyses were performed for the Raba River catchment (Poland, Carpathian Mountains) with use of the Macromodel DNS/SWAT. The RCP 4.5 climate forecast predictions (2021-2050 and 2071-2100), downscaled for the area of Poland, and land use predictions from the DYNA-Clue model for the Carpathian area, were taken into consideration. A total of seven scenarios were created, accounting for precipitation (P1 and P2), temperature (T1 and T2), land use (LU) changes, and combined effects (COMB1 and COMB2). Results and discussion The average load delivered to the dam reservoir was estimated as 2.43 Gg y(-1), and its seasonal/yearly variability was followed by local meteorological phenomena. Among the tested factors, precipitation change, in terms of total amount and intensity, exerted the most impact on sediment loads causing their increase. Temperature and land use changes resulted in a slight decrease. Combined scenarios implied that changes of the catchment area use, such as increase of forest cover, can noticeably reduce sediment loads delivered into a dam reservoir. Conclusions The performed simulations revealed the importance of incorporating variant scenarios for catchment management plans, development of land use mitigation measures (erosion), and operational procedures for the dam reservoir. Particular attention should be paid to warmer winters with heavy rainfalls and temperatures above zero, which together with a lack of plant vegetation result in elevated annual sediment loads reaching the dam reservoir. Further changes must be mitigated by anti-erosion investments.

Such events can be characterized with the maximum level in an extreme storm surge event (surge peak), as well as the duration of the event. Surge projections come from a barotropic model for the 1950-2100 period, under a severe climate change scenario (RCP 8.5) at the northeastern Spanish coast. The relationship of extreme storm surges to three large-scale climate patterns was assessed: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic Pattern (EAWR), and Scandinavian Pattern (SC). The statistical model was built using two different strategies. In Strategy #1, the joint probability density was characterized by a moving-average series of stationary Archimedean copula, whereas in Strategy #2, the joint probability density was characterized by a non-stationary probit copula. The parameters of the marginal distribution and the copula were defined with generalized additive models. The analysis showed that the mean values of surge peak and event duration were constant and were independent of the proposed climate patterns. However, the values of NAO and SC influenced the threshold and the storminess of extreme events. According to Strategy #1, the variance of the surge peak and event duration increased with a fast shift of negative SC and a positive NAO, respectively. Alternatively, Strategy #2 showed that the variance of the surge peak increased with a positive EAWR. Both strategies coincided in that the joint dependence of the maximum surge level and the duration of extreme surges ranged from low to medium degree. Its mean value was stationary, and its variability was linked to the geographical location. Finally, Strategy #2 helped determine that this dependence increased with negative NAO.

Despite an emerging global interest in this association, Africa remains poorly represented in the literature. Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed studies was conducted to determine the adverse mental health outcomes associated with extreme weather events in Africa (2008-2021). The review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).Results: A total of 12,204 peer-reviewed articles were identified of which 12 were retained for analysis. These studies were all conducted in 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adverse mental health outcomes were identified resulting from flood (n = 4), drought (n = 4), extreme heat (n = 1), bushfire (n = 1), and multiple events (n = 2). Findings included pathological outcomes with predictable symptomatology including mood disorders; trauma-and stressor-related disorders; and suicide. Additionally, conditions indicating psychological distress which were below the pathological threshold including emotion regulation difficulties, disturbed sleep, alcohol use, stress, and anxiety. The quantitative evidence for the association between extreme weather events and mental health was limited primar-ily by a lack of longitudinal data, exposure gradient, and comparison to an unaffected group, as well as a failure to pro-vide an objective exposure measure. The qualitative evidence for this association was complimentary but without sufficient clinical measurement these outcomes cannot be verified as psychological morbidities. In addition, this re-view provided insight into the mental health of vulnerable communities affected by extreme weather events including those living in poverty, farmers, pastoralists, women, and children.Conclusion: This review provided some preliminary evidence for the association between extreme weather events and adverse mental health outcomes for populations in Africa. The review also provides insight to vulnerable populations affected by extreme weather events. Future research with stronger designs and methodologies are recommended.

Therefore, their knowledge, predictability, and mitigation represent a key challenge for the scientific community in the coming decades, especially in those local areas that are most vulnerable to these extreme events. In this sense, a multiscale analysis is essential to obtain detailed maps of the future evolution of floods. In the multiscale analysis, the historical and future precipitation data from the CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) project are used as input in a hydrological model (HEC-HMS) which, in turn, feeds a 2D hydraulic model (Iber+). This integration allows knowing the projected future changes in the flow pattern of the river, as well as analyzing the impact of floods in vulnerable areas through the flood hazard maps obtained with hydraulic simulations. The multiscale analysis is applied to the case of the Mino-Sil basin (NW Spain), specifically to the city of Ourense. The results show a delay in the flood season and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme river flows in the Mino-Sil basin, which will cause more situations of flooding in many areas frequented by pedestrians and in important infrastructure of the city of Ourense. In addition, an increase in water depths associated with future floods was also detected, confirming the trend for future floods to be not only more frequent but also more intense. Detailed maps of the future evolution of floods also provide key information to decision-makers to take effective measures in advance in those areas most vulnerable to flooding in the coming decades. Although the methodology presented is applied to a particular area, its strength lies in the fact that its implementation in other basins and cities is simple, also taking into account that all the models used are freely accessible.

Various innovative approaches have emerged to address this challenge. In China, the Sponge City was first proposed in 2012 to achieve an urban hydrological balance through natural storage, natural infiltration and natural purification. This article presents a comparative investigation (using a survey method) of new and old communities in Xixian New District and Xi'an in September 2021 to investigate public awareness of the Sponge City and understand levels of satisfaction and acceptance. Individuals of the same age or education residing in the Sponge City generally know more about the Sponge City and were more willing to accept it than those in traditional cities. Moreover, the residents of Sponge City understand the Sponge City concept well, with a majority of the respondents (71.82%) expressing clear understanding on the conception of Sponge City. However, residents in a traditional city exhibited much less understanding of the concept (44.24%). Furthermore, for those living in the same area, people who are younger or have higher education exhibited a clearer understanding of and acceptance of the Sponge City and local government. In this survey, the average scores (assign values to the different responses, then average and percent it) of respondents in Xixian New District with master's degrees, bachelor's degrees and high school degrees or below were evaluated at 76.88, 67.94 and 62.15, respectively, compared to 62.07, 50.18 and 50.78 in Xi'an. Lastly, we found that differences in living environment have a significant influence on residents' perceptions. Residents living in the Sponge City are generally satisfied with the travel and living conditions and greatly support the local government. Meanwhile, this study will help relevant authorities pay more attention to residents' opinions and help them to formulate policies to spread the concept of Sponge City and encourage residents' participation.

OzFlux is a network not only for ecosystem researchers, but also for those 'next users' of the knowledge, information and data that such networks provide. Here, we focus on eight lessons across topics of climate change and variability, disturbance and resilience, drought and heat stress and synergies with remote sensing and modelling. In distilling the key lessons learned, we also identify where further research is needed to fill knowledge gaps and improve the utility and relevance of the outputs from OzFlux. Extreme climate variability across Australia and New Zealand (droughts and flooding rains) provides a natural laboratory for a global understanding of ecosystems in this time of accelerating climate change. As evidence of worsening global fire risk emerges, the natural ability of these ecosystems to recover from disturbances, such as fire and cyclones, provides lessons on adaptation and resilience to disturbance. Drought and heatwaves are common occurrences across large parts of the region and can tip an ecosystem's carbon budget from a net CO2 sink to a net CO2 source. Despite such responses to stress, ecosystems at OzFlux sites show their resilience to climate variability by rapidly pivoting back to a strong carbon sink upon the return of favourable conditions. Located in under-represented areas, OzFlux data have the potential for reducing uncertainties in global remote sensing products, and these data provide several opportunities to develop new theories and improve our ecosystem models. The accumulated impacts of these lessons over the last 20 years highlights the value of long-term flux observations for natural and managed systems. A future vision for OzFlux includes ongoing and newly developed synergies with ecophysiologists, ecologists, geologists, remote sensors and modellers.

Vertically stacked, weakly developed paleosols within Upper Pleistocene and Holocene mud-prone strata testify to intermittent pedogenesis, periodically interrupted by overbank sedimentation. Individual paleosols are laterally traceable for tens of km and exhibit A-Bk-Bw, A-Bk or A-Bw profiles. Strati graphically ordered 14C calibrated ages from A organo-mineral horizons testify to slow aggradation during 4-6 thousand years-long exposure periods. Burial ages, with an error of few centuries, are provided by plant debris at the top of A horizons. Millennial-scale climate oscillations and glacio-eustasy are the main drivers of the pedo-sedimentary evolution of the area during the last 50 kyr. Upper Pleistocene paleosols (P1-P3) developed in well-drained floodplain environments, during relatively warm periods.Paleosol burial occurred during colder phases. High-sediment supply during the Last Glacial Maximum hindered pedogenesis and led to the accumulation of 3-10 m-thick overbank strata. Widespread soil development (paleosol PH) occurred at the end of Last Glacial Maximum, following the retreat of Alpine glaciers and the afforestation of Apennine drainage basins. At distal locations, paleosol PH was progressively buried under estuarine sediments during the Holocene phases of post-glacial sea level rise. Beyond the area of marine influence, burial ages of paleosol PH change from a place to another without specific spatial trends and reflect upstream fluvial sedimentation dominated by avulsions and deposition of spatially restricted alluvial units. Holocene (H1-H2) paleosols show a poor correlation potential and laterally variable degree of maturity that reflect avulsive sedimentation patterns and crevassing. This paper provides insights on the timing and mechanisms of formation and burial of weakly-developed paleosols. The outcomes of this research are applicable to similar Quaternary alluvial systems, and may help interpreting ancient paleosolbearing successions.

J	Sargeant, CI; Singer, MB				Sargeant, Christopher, I; Singer, Michael Bliss			Local and non-local controls on seasonal variations in water availability and use by riparian trees along a hydroclimatic gradient	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						riparian vegetation; groundwater; streamflow; Rhone; France	SAN-PEDRO RIVER; DIE-OFF; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; MORTALITY; FLOODPLAIN; ECOSYSTEMS; HYDROLOGY; RESPONSES; DISTRIBUTIONS	As global climate change continues to impact regional water cycles, we may expect further shifts in water availability to forests that create challenges for certain species and biomes. Lowland deciduous riparian forests are particularly vulnerable because tree species cannot migrate out of the stream corridor, and they rely on root zone water availability that is controlled by variations in both local climate conditions (e.g. precipitation, evaporation, and infiltration) and non-local hydroclimatic forcing (e.g. streamflow, snowmelt, recharge). To determine how the seasonal water source usage of riparian trees is controlled by local versus non-local variability in hydroclimatic regime, we reconstructed the seasonal oxygen isotope (delta (18) O) signature of water used by two riparian tree species with contrasting rooting depths, comprising similar to 800 delta (18) O tree-ring cellulose measurements from 12 tree-level decadal time-series at sub-annual resolution (six samples per year), along a strong hydroclimatic gradient within the Rhone River basin, SE France. These results were evaluated alongside delta (18) O measurements made from potential endmember water sources and independent hydroclimatic metrics. Thus we characterize the seasonal evolution of both potential water availability at distinct rooting depths and tree water source use and investigate the generalized riparian tree response to seasonal variations in local versus non-local hydroclimatic forcing over a decade. We show: (a) distinct seasonal water use between species, based on differential access to groundwater; (b) substantial source switching in both species based on evolving water availability; and (c) that riparian trees are more dependent on locally controlled soil moisture with distance downstream, creating increased vulnerability to locally increasing temperatures. We also find that deeply rooted trees in lowland riparian floodplains are potentially vulnerable to climate change because of their high dependence on water supply from mountains. This effect is more pronounced downstream, where seasonal water table decline may lead to loss of water required for deeply rooted trees.

Review of assimilating GRACE terrestrial water storage data into hydrological models: Advances, challenges and opportunities	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Review						Water storage changes; Remote sensing; GRACE; GRACE errors; Hydrological modeling; Data assimilation	ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION; LAND-SURFACE MODEL; SOIL-MOISTURE DATA; GRAVITY-FIELD; SATELLITE PRODUCTS; REDUCED-ORDER; RIVER-BASINS; HEAT-FLUX; ERRORS	Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts lead to alterations in the water cycle, water resource availability and the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. As a result, developing effective techniques such as hydrological modeling is essential to monitor and predict water storage changes. However, inaccuracies and uncertainties in different aspects of modeling, due to simplification of meteorological physical processes, data limitations and inaccurate climate forcing data limit the reliability of hydrological models. Satellite remote sensing datasets, especially Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data which can be obtained from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), provide a new and valuable source of data which can augment our understanding of the hydrologic cycle. Merging these new observations with hydrological models can effectively enhance the model performance using advanced statistical and numerical methods, which is known as data assimilation. Assimilation of new observations constrain the dynamics of the model based on uncertainties associated with both model and data, which can introduce missing water storage signals e.g., anthropogenic and extreme climate change effects. Assimilation of GRACE TWS data into hydrological models is a challenging task as provision should be made for handling the errors and then merging them with hydrological models using efficient assimilation techniques. The goal of this paper is to provide an in-depth overview of recent studies on assimilating GRACE TWS data into hydrological models and shed light on their limitations, challenges and progress. We present a comprehensive review of some challenges with GRACE TWS data assimilation into a hydrological model including GRACE TWS errors e.g., the correlated noise of high-frequency mass variations and spatial leakage errors, and how to work with GRACE TWS data errors to use the potential of GRACE TWS data as much as possible. We provide a review of the benefits and limitations of available data assimilation techniques with emphasis on the capability of sequential methods for hydrological applications.

Using high-frequency sampling, the export of water, sediment and C was examined in the Wuding River catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. With groundwater as an important contributor to runoff all year round, floods were relatively less important in the export of water. However, large floods were disproportionately important in exporting sediment and inorganic C (DIC) and organic C (DOC and POC). The three largest floods in each year transported 53.6-97.3 and 41.4-77% of the annual sediment and C fluxes, respectively. An extreme flood in 2017 alone contributed 94.6 and 73.1% of the annual sediment and C fluxes, respectively, in just 7 days, which included 20.3, 92.1 and 35.7% of the annual DOC, POC and DIC fluxes, respectively. A stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) analysis of POC indicated that modern soils and C3 plants were its primary source. Furthermore, floods greatly accelerated CO(2)degassing due to elevated gas transfer velocity, although stream water CO(2)partial pressure (pCO(2)) exhibited a decreasing trend with flow discharge. Although these results illustrated that increasing runoff dilutedpCO(2), the timing and magnitude of floods were found to be critical in determining the response ofpCO(2)to flow dynamics. Low-magnitude floods in the early wet season increasedpCO(2)because of enhanced organic matter input, while subsequent large floods caused a lowerpCO(2)due to greatly reduced organic matter supply. Finally, continuous monitoring of a complete flood event showed that the CO(2)efflux during the flood (2348 +/- 664 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) was three times that under low-flow conditions (808 +/- 98 mg C m(-2) day(-1)). Our study suggests that infrequent, heavy storm events, which are predicted to increase under climate change, will greatly alter the transport regimes of sediment and C.

Their impact is projected to be exacerbated by future climate scenarios. HMHs cataloguing is an effective tool to evaluate their associated risks and plan appropriate remediation strategies. However, factors linked to HMHs origin and triggers remain uncertain, which pose a challenge for their cataloguing. Focusing on key HMHs (floods, storm surges, landslides, droughts, and heatwaves), the goal of this review paper is to analyse and present a classification scheme, key features, and elements for designing nature-based solutions (NBS) and mitigating the adverse impacts of HMHs in Europe. For this purpose, we systematically examined the literature on NBS classification and assessed the gaps that hinder the widespread uptake of NBS. Furthermore, we critically evaluated the existing literature to give a better understanding of the HMHs drivers and their interrelationship (causing multi-hazards). Further conceptualisation of classification scheme and categories of NBS shows that relatively few studies have been carried out on utilising the broader concepts of NBS in tackling HMHs and that the classification and effectiveness of each NBS are dependent on the location, architecture, typology, green species and environmental conditions, as well as interrelated non-linear systems. NBS are often more cost-effective than hard engineering approaches used within the existing systems, especially when taking into consideration their potential co-benefits. We also evaluated the sources of available data for HMHs and NBS, highlighted gaps in data, and presented strategies to overcome the current shortcomings for the development of the NBS for HMHs. We highlighted specific gaps and barriers that need to be filled since the uptake and upscaling studies of NBS in HMHs reduction is rare. The fundamental concepts and the key technical features of past studies reviewed here could help practitioners to design and implement NBS in a real-world situation.

High mountain lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River serve as sensitive indicators of climate change in the region. In this study, lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River are examined using a Landsat image series. A total of 959 lakes covering a total area of 328.39 +/- 5.51 km(2) were identified in 2015, of which 91% were distributed in the larger Naryn River basin, and the remaining lakes were in the smaller Kara Darya River basin. During the period of the 1990s to 2015, a clear expansion trend in both lake area (+ 6.64 km(2)) and number of lakes (+ 205) was observed. Glacial lakes contributed 69% of the increase in the number of lakes. Among the four lake types, proglacial lakes showed the fastest area expansion with an average relative growth rate of 94% from the 1990s to 2015, 5-8 times that of the other three lake types: nonglacial lakes, unconnected-fed lakes and unconnected-nonfed lakes. Lake Petrov was the fastest growing glacial lake (+ 0.05 km(2) yr(-1)) during the past century and will continue to expand as its supply glacier continues to retreat. The continuous expansion and potential outburst risk of the Lake Petrov poses a serious threat to downstream toxic tailing ponds of the Kumtor Gold Mine. Lake Song Kol, the largest natural lake in this region, presented a steady status during 1972-2017. The warming climate-caused acceleration of glacial melt is thought to be the primary reason for the lake enlargements in this region. The lake inventory prepared here is valuable baseline dataset for the evaluation of water resources in the Syr Darya River drainage basin and for the potential risk and hazard assessments of glacial lake outburst floods.

NFM is a nature-based approach that has since gained substantial interest from both practitioners and academics. The review further highlighted the need for catchment-based flood management (CBFM) to enhance resilience to flooding and climate change by incorporating NFM and wider nature-based solutions into hard flood protection systems. Such integrated approaches are considered to be more sustainable and adaptable than the traditional hard-engineered measures. More recently, the European Commission's European Green Deal also highlighted the need for greater use of nature-based solutions including NFM for managing flood risk. Whilst there have been many attempts to quantify the effects of NFM through hydraulic and hydrological modelling, there is still no systematic review conducted for these modelling works. This review aims to summarise the current NFM modelling approaches, as well as discussing their key limitations related to data, model methods, and real-world applications. This paper then goes further to highlight potential solutions to some of these challenges and provides guidance to assist modellers to improve future modelling and data collection process.

A complete sedimentary sequence of alluvia, found in the Yuxi profile (YXP) was applied to explore features of the palaeoflood layers that maintained records related to the contexts of flooding hydroclimate. The AMS(14)C dating results dependent on animal bones from the YXP validate that the chronology of the palaeoflood layers was dated, between ca. 8200 and 6400 a BP, and multiple cultural layers were intercut among these palaeoflood layers. By means of particle size and end-member analyses for the palaeoflood sediments, the fractions of fine silt and clay in deposits account for a high proportion of the flood sediments, suggesting that the overbank flood was the main power in building the palaeoflood layers. Due to the climatic episodes defined by pollen assemblages, the thickness of the flood layers is positively correlated with soil erosion because of different hydrothermal conditions. The wavelet spectra of the mean particle-size series also suggest that there may be two major palaeoflooding cycles of similar to 700 and similar to 30 years. Despite the sustained palaeoflooding, the Yuxi Culture grew from small to big, and was never broken off, in terms of the findings of artificial remains in the YXP.

Climate change impact on water supply and hydropower generation potential in Northern Manitoba	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Climate change; Cascade river-reservoir system; Hydropower; Hydrologic modeling; Operations modeling; Model coupling	ROBUSTNESS; CANADA; FUTURE; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; DESIGN; CMIP5	Study focus: Hydroelectricity makes up almost 97% of electricity generated in Manitoba, of which over 70% of its generation capacity is installed along the Lower Nelson River (LNR). In this study, 19 climate projections representing ~ 87% of climatic variability over Hudson Bay Drainage Basin are applied to coupled hydrologic-operations models to estimate water supply and hydropower generation potential changes under future climates.New hydrological insights for the region: Future inflow to the forebay of the main hydropower generating stations along LNR is expected to increase in spring and summer but decrease in winter and fall. Consequently, hydropower generation potential is projected to increase for spring, the historical flood season, which may lead to reduced reservoir inflow retention efficiency. In extremely dry climatic simulations, winter seasons see a reduction in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential, up to 35% and 37% in 2021-2050 and 2041-2070, respectively. Projected changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower generation potential continue to diverge over time, with dry scenarios becoming drier and wet becoming wetter, yielding high basin climate sensitivity and uncertainty with system supply and generation potential. Despite the presence of statistically significant individual trends and changes, there is a low agreement within the climate ensemble. Analysis of system robustness shows adjustment of the operations along LNR should be considered over time to better leverage changing seasonal water supply.

We quantify official historical records of China dating back last 2000 years to examine the disasters due to anomalous temperatures of cold or hot, irregular precipitations of wet or dry, and floods in inland/coastal or Northern/Southern areas in four seasons that possibly linked to solar activities during 1-1825 CE (Common Era). It is found that the proportion of disaster years is positively associated with the time periods, and therefore, both the cases with high and low solar activity (HSA and LSA) leading are under study. Statistical results show that extreme cold weather occurs particularly in the Winter and Spring during LSA periods. Irregularities precipitations, including heavy rain/hail/snow and severe drought are significantly frequent during LSA periods, while floods on inland and coastal river basins tend to occur more frequently in LSA and HSA periods, respectively. The disasters owing to irregularities precipitations and floods frequently happen in Summer and Autumn, which suggests that the irregular precipitations could cause the floods. All the disasters occur significantly in the Northern China, which suggests the climate boundary of the Qinling-Huaihe Line along at about 33 degrees N being essential. In total, all the disasters due to the anomalously cold temperatures, irregular precipitations, and floods tend to occur during the LSA periods.

Evaluating natural infrastructure for flood management within the watersheds of selected global cities	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flood storage; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Land-use change; Protected areas, WaterWorld	MAPPING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; SCIENCE; IMPACT	Cities are dependent on their upstream watersheds for storage and gradual release of water into river systems. These watersheds act as important flood mitigation infrastructure, providing an essential ecosystem service. In this paper we use metrics from the WaterWorld model to examine the flood management-relevant natural infrastructure of the upstream watersheds of selected global cities. These metrics enable the characterisation of different types, magnitudes and geographical distributions of potential natural flood storage. The storages are categorised as either green (forest canopy, wetland and soil) or blue (water body and floodplain) storages and the proportion of green to blue indicates how different city upstream basin contexts provide different types and levels of storage which may buffer flood risk. We apply the WaterWorld method for examining flood risk as the ratio of accumulated modelled annual runoff volume to accumulated available green and blue water storage capacity. The aim of these metrics is to highlight areas where there is more runoff than storage capacity and thus where the maintenance or restoration of further natural infrastructure (such as canopy cover, wetlands and soil) could aid in storing more water and thus better alleviate flood risks. Such information is needed by urban planners. city authorities and governments to help prepare cities for climate change impacts. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has also become a point of conflict between cities' objectives for development and modernization, and the struggles of marginalized residents living in low-lying coastal and riverine areas to remain in place. Flooding takes on different forms depending on one's point of view. It is a biophysical issue, involving geology, geography, meteorology and ecology. It is one of urban governance, involving planning and maintenance of infrastructure and land use. And it is sociopolitical, involving historical social and spatial marginalization and contestation. This article, based on mixed-methods research in Jakarta, Indonesia, traces the conceptual and physical contours of urban waterscapes across these conflicting ideas and narratives. It brings into dialogue theories of urban political ecology, landscape ecology and environmental ethnography to explore the interrelationships between biophysical and sociopolitical factors behind urban flooding. In the article the focus is on the varying materialities and scales involved, including the ecological scales of the watershed, the infrastructural scales associated with flood protection, and the urban scales of planning, governance and social activism. The article concludes with a proposition for a multidimensional approach to thinking and acting on problems of urban ecological change.

Theoretically, urban form has the dual aspect concept of increasing or decreasing flood damage. Recent issues such as climate change and pandemics are increasing the need to re-discuss the relationship between urban forms and natural hazards. By revisiting the dual aspect concepts of urban forms such as aggregation and dispersion, we can effectively respond to specific urban problems that present complex issues at the city level. Accordingly, this paper once again considers what is a more resilient and ideal urban form for natural hazards by exploring dual aspect concepts of urban form for flood damage spatially and quantitatively from a macroscopic point of view.

With the lowest per capita energy consumption among world's top ten economies, India ranks at 137 out of 218 nations. Hydropower has the potential to alleviate India's energy asymmetry as well as realize its sustainable growth aspiration of a low-carbon regime. However, hydropower in India has been plagued by debates on human displacement, loss of biodiversity, increased risk of natural disasters, and socio-economic conflicts making it an unpopular energy alternative. Here, we review and address various concerns related to India's hydropower sector, examine scientific evidence, analyze energy policy imperatives, geopolitical considerations, and future directions for a sustainable hydropower policy in India in the context of ongoing climate change. Evidence indicates that besides electricity generation, hydropower infrastructure helps: (i) avert floods, (ii) mitigate the impacts of global warming, and (iii) ensure redistribution of water to arid regions and improve water security. As a part of sustainable hydropower policy, we propose that most of the ecological and social problems associated with hydropower development can be avoided to a great extent through careful planning, proper project design, responsible ownership, and public participation. As short-term measures, we propose: (i) entrepreneurs and planners follow credible and transparent pre-project investigations, (ii) mandatory implementation of environmental management plans, and (iii) better accountability and transparency of statutory bodies as well as hydropower developers. For long-term measures, we suggest: (i) create a 'National Institute of Energy & Environmental Sustainability' to oversee post-project hydropower developmental activities, (ii) streamline various bureaucratic and institutional procedures, and (ii) establish a trans-boundary water management system for seamless and coordinated implementation of hydropower development programs across upstream-downstream nations.

In climate change impacts, flood becomes the most devastating in deltaic regions due to the inundation of crops within a short period of time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to propose climate-adaptive crops that are suitable for the flood inundation in risk-prone areas of Bangladesh. The research area included two districts adjacent to the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, covering an area of 5489 km(2), and these districts were classified as highly to moderately vulnerable due to inundation by flood water during the seasonal monsoon time. In this study, first, an inundation vulnerability map was prepared from the multicriteria analysis by applying a fuzzy expert system in the GIS environment using satellite remote sensing datasets. Among the analyzed area, 42.3% was found to be highly to moderately vulnerable, 42.1% was marginally vulnerable and 15.6% was not vulnerable to inundation. Second, the most vulnerable areas for flooding were identified from the previous major flood events and cropping practices based on the crop calendar. Based on the crop adaptation suitability analysis, two cash crops, sugarcane and jute, were recommended for cultivation during major flooding durations. Finally, a land suitability analysis was conducted through multicriteria analysis applying a fuzzy expert system. According to our analysis, 28.6% of the land was highly suitable, 27.9% was moderately suitable, 19.7% was marginally suitable and 23.6% of the land was not suitable for sugarcane and jute cultivation in the vulnerable areas. The inundation vulnerability and suitability analysis proposed two crops, sugarcane and jute, as potential candidates for climate-adaptive selection in risk-prone areas.

Climate change-induced flooding events are increasing worldwide, disproportionately impacting low-income and developing communities. While early warning systems save lives, satellite-based observation systems are vital for the disaster relief and recovery phases. Current satellite-based operational flood products are largely based on either optical remote-sensing methods, which exhibit a limited ability to detect water through clouds and vegetation, or microwave remote sensing, which provides relatively low spatial and temporal resolution. New small satellite constellations using radar or GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) have been shown to enhance our ability to overcome these deficiencies. In this work, we quantify the performance of using GNSS-R measurements from the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite Systems (CYGNSS) satellite constellation to map surface water in South Sudan and the Sudd wetland in comparison with a set of representative operational products. We make quantitative comparisons of our results with operational flood products based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and MODIS and with C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar. We find that our method detects 35.4% more surface water than Sentinel-1, while the VIIRS- and MODIS-based products underestimate by 4.8% and 83.7%, respectively. We use several metrics commonly used to evaluate classification performance: precision, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), F2-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and assess the comparisons in this statistical framework. We discuss the consequences of our findings, including ways CYGNSS data may enhance current flood products and assist decision-makers and emergency managers.

J	Marr, SM; Swemmer, AM				Marr, Sean Murray; Swemmer, Anthony Michael			Hydrological characteristics of extreme floods in the Klaserie River, a headwater stream in southern Africa	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						flow duration curves; flood frequency; flood hydro-graph; Parde coefficient; peaks over threshold; regression tree	WATER; FREQUENCY; WORLD; MAP	Climate change models for southern Africa predict less frequent, but more intense, rainfall events, and an increased frequency of tropical cyclones. With their steep topography and small catchments, headwater streams generate large floods following intense rainfall events. Large flooding events in headwater streams are under studied in southern Africa. In this paper, we explore flooding in the upper Klaserie River, Limpopo River System, South Africa, to determine the flow distribution and flood frequency for the catchment. In ad-dition, we determine the return level for a large, economically damaging, flood generated following the landfall of a sub-tropical de-pression in January 2012 and, attempt to identify rainfall patterns that resulted in similar floods. An annual hydrological cycle with summer maxima and winter minima for both rainfall and flow was identified. The flood frequency analysis demonstrated that the January 2012 flood had an estimated return level of 225 years. This flood had a peak flowrate exceeding 1200 m3s-1 in a system with an average daily flowrate of 1 m3s-1. Regression tree analysis showed that a two-day rainfall in excess of 240 was a predictor for four of the five largest floods. A two-day rainfall in excess of 400 mm distinguished the January 2012 flood from other floods. Non-stationarity analyses for the flow and rainfall data and a SWAT hydrological model are recommend for the upper Klaserie River to evaluate climate and land cover changes, and their relationship to the magnitude of the 2012 flood. Our study demonstrates that South African river monitoring data can be used to detect and characterize major floods, despite deficiencies in these data. Continuation of these monitoring programs is vital for river health monitoring and the detection of trends in floods resulting from human activities and climate change.

Cathryn; He, Jianxun			Hydrological behaviour of an unregulated eastern slope river under changing historical climate	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL			English	Article							ROCKY-MOUNTAIN RIVERS; PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; IMPACTS; STREAMFLOW; FLOWS; BASIN	The Elbow River is an eastern slope river with headwaters in the Rocky Mountains in Alberta whose major end-use is a critical source of municipal water for Calgary. Overwinter precipitation in its watershed falls primarily as snow and accumulates as snowpack until spring melt. Precipitation falls mainly as rain from May until October. The river is unregulated above Calgary's water supply reservoir, and its relatively undeveloped watershed makes it ideal for examining potential climate change impacts on river hydrology. Available historical hydrometeorological data (1967 to 2015) from the basin were assessed to study its hydrological behaviour under a changing climate. The analysis showed significant upward trends in both flow and precipitation variables, especially from 1979 to 2015. Significant increases in both annual flow volume and annual maximum daily flow (AM-flow), and later seasonal occurrence of AM-flow, were not observed in other eastern slope rivers. Although these changes could attenuate predicted water supply shortages, they could also potentially increase flood magnitudes. The analysis also revealed that three sub-watersheds, which are approximately equal in geographic area, contributed differing flow volumes during the high-flow season (May to October). The upper watershed contributed most (similar to 68%), followed by the middle (similar to 26%) and lower (similar to 6%) watersheds, on average. Extreme high-flow events (ie >90(th) percentile AM-flow) were strongly related to high rainfall events, but not significantly related to snowpack loss (or melt). Moderate AM-flows were positively related to both the cumulative snowpack loss before the high-flow season and the cumulative antecedent precipitation prior to the AM-flow, suggesting that the antecedent soil moisture conditions could play a role. Predictions of climate change impacts on this eastern slope river's hydrology should thus consider the effects of meteorological variables and the moisture conditions of the watershed.

In Europe, they have been responsible for 359 fatalities and an economic loss totalling 67 million USD in the past decade (EM-DAT), while their increasing severity is linked to climate change. Nevertheless, flash floods remain a poorly documented natural phenomenon due to the lack of flow intensity data in many of the affected watersheds. Based on a thorough field investigation, including UAV-based 3D mapping and material characterization with on-site testing, we carry out a numerical study of a notable flood that caused the collapse of bridges and buildings in Central Greece, following a recent Mediterranean hurricane. Focusing on a carefully selected case study, we combine 3D modelling of flow-structure interaction with detailed mechanical modelling of the nonlinear structural response to reproduce the flood-induced fracture of a bridge abutment. Back-analysis of this failure responds to the fundamental problem of estimating the undocumented magnitude of this extreme event. The paper estimates a lower bound value of the flow velocity at the studied location. This can be valuable input for the interpretation of the extensive damage that took place downstream and for the re-assessment of flood risk in a region where similar events are expected to become more frequent because of climate change. The approach, where disaster forensics and engineering analysis are used to fill the gap of missing real-time measurements, can be implemented for the a posteriori estimation of flood intensity in similar events. The well-documented case study of a bridge failure due to extreme flooding can also be used for validation of future numerical and experimental methods and motivate investigations of the mechanisms governing flow-soil-structure interaction in river crossings.

In the scenario of various disasters and risks, flood disasters are the most recurrent hazards that cause Bait households' livelihood to be more vulnerable. Hence, this research work has focused to investigate livelihood vulnerability of flood-prone Bait households in southern Punjab of Pakistan. This study used multistage sampling technique for collection of the cross-sectional data of 398 flood disasters vulnerable Bait household's respondents from three high-risk flood-prone districts Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan. Face-to-face interview procedure and welldeveloped pre-tested questionnaire were used for data collection in this research work. This study applied vulnerability framework of LVI-IPCC and LVI in the direction of comparing the level of vulnerabilities in preferred three Bait district households. Empirical estimates of LVI major components and framework of IPCC vulnerability have indicated Bait households of Muzaffargarh more vulnerable owing to higher exposure and sensitivity and lower adaptive capacity than other districts. In contrast to other districts, Muzaffargarh households have investigated more vulnerable to flood disasters more particularly in LVI sub-components such as health (0.460), water (0.360), and food (0.515) access. These research findings will be helpful to policymakers to work out and put into practice effectual programs and strategies such as constructing more water reserves, developing overhead infrastructure, easy access of institutional loans, and generating off-farm income sources. These local-based feasible measures will be helpful for native inhabitants to reduce frequency of floods in the direction of lessened vulnerability and increased resilience via recovering generally the livelihood of vulnerable Bait households in Punjab Pakistan and particularly the district Muzaffargarh.

Wetland ecosystem services, ranging from provision of food security to climate change mitigation, are enormous, far outweighing those of dryland ecosystems per hectare. However, land use change and water regulation infrastructure have reduced connectivity in many river systems and with floodplain and estuarine wetlands. Mangrove forests are critical communities for carbon uptake and storage, pollution control and detoxification, and regulation of natural hazards. Although the clearing of mangroves in Australia is strictly regulated, Great Barrier Reef catchments have suffered landscape modifications and hydrological alterations that can kill mangroves. We used remote sensing datasets to investigate land cover change and both intra- and inter-annual seasonality in mangrove forests in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, which encompasses a national park and Ramsar Wetland, and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. We built a time series using spectral, auxiliary, and phenology variables with Landsat surface reflectance products, accessed in Google Earth Engine. Two land cover classes were generated (mangrove versus non-mangrove) in a Random Forest classification. Mangroves decreased by 1480 hectares (-2.31%) from 2009 to 2019. The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2008-2010 and 2018-2020 land cover maps were 95% and 95%, respectively. Using an NDVI-based time series we examined intra- and inter-annual seasonality with linear and harmonic regression models, and second with TIMESAT metrics of mangrove forests in three sections of our study region. Our findings suggest a relationship between mangrove growth phenology along with precipitation anomalies and severe tropical cyclone occurrence over the time series. The detection of responses to extreme events is important to improve understanding of the connections between climate, extreme weather events, and biodiversity in estuarine and mangrove ecosystems.

These environmental disruptions have significant effects on human health, especially cardiovascular health.1 Understanding these effects, including measures to mitigate and adapt to a changing environment, is becoming increasingly important to the practice of cardiovascular medicine. Environmental hazards can worsen cardiovascular risk through direct (air pollution, food insecurity, and poor mental health) and indirect pathways (systemic risks such as flooding, heat waves, wildfires, infrastructure breakdown, community disruptions, worsening poverty), necessitating a broad approach to enhancing cardiovascular health, with adequate emphasis on mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Impact of Coral Reef Mining Pits on Nearshore Hydrodynamics and Wave Runup During Extreme Wave Events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						coral reefs; mining pits; hydrodynamics; wave runup; XBeach; coastal flooding	SEA-LEVEL RISE; FRINGING-REEF; BATHYMETRIC ANOMALIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MAJURO ATOLL; TRANSFORMATION; VULNERABILITY; DISSIPATION; PROPAGATION; PREDICTIONS	Small island developing states are among the most vulnerable areas to the impact of natural hazards and climate change. Flooding due to storm surges and extreme waves, coastal erosion, and salinization of freshwater lenses are already a serious threat and could lead to irreversible consequences in the coming decades. Reef flat mining is one of the most common practices to source the required material for the implementation of coastal protection measures, but concerns remain that partial removal of the protective reef could increase wave loading on the islands. However, the available data and knowledge on the effects of these mining pits are currently very limited. This study provides new insights on the effects that pits may have on nearshore hydrodynamics and wave runup. Results are based on a large numerical data set of fringing reefs, derived using the validated XBeach nonhydrostatic+ process-based model. Model results indicate that excavation pits cause a decrease in infragravity wave energy around the fundamental mode of the reef, which is partly caused by reduced wave transmission. Additionally, changes in sea and swell wave energy are attributed to reduced transmission, a decrease in wave dissipation, and (triad) wave-wave interaction. Furthermore, in 13% of all modeled cases, an increase in wave runup is observed, mainly due to more sea and swell wave energy reaching the shoreline. This probability is lowest for narrow pits relative to the reef flat width or pits located further from shore. Plain Language Summary Many small island states are among the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, flooding due to storms, coastal erosion, and loss of freshwater supply already form a serious threat. Mining of dead coral sediments from the reef flat is a common practice to source material for coastal protection works. This could potentially lead to higher waves at the coastline through the partial removal of the reef, which breaks large waves. However, the knowledge on the effects of these mining pits is currently very limited. The present study provides improved explanations on the effects that a pit may have on waves and assesses the resulting risk of flooding it poses on these islands. The results are obtained by simulating a large set of different reefs and wave conditions using a numerical model named XBeach. These show that the effect of a pit can vary significantly, but in general, a pit causes lower waves near the shoreline. At some cases, larger waves at the shoreline were found, thereby increasing the risk of flooding. This risk is the lowest for pits that are located further from the coastline, or those that have narrow width relative to the reef width.	[Klaver, S.; Nederhoff, C. M.; Giardino, A.; van Dongeren, A.

Climate Change and Potential Demise of the Indian Deserts	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						global warming and potential westward expansion of Indian monsoon	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; PREDICTABILITY; INCREASE; ROBUST; ZONE	In contrast to the "wet gets wetter and dry gets drier" paradigm, here, using observations and climate model simulations, we show that the mean rainfall over the semi-arid northwest parts of India and Pakistan has increased by 10%-50% during 1901-2015 and is expected to increase by 50%-200% under moderate greenhouse gas (GHG) scenarios. The GHG forcing primarily drives the westward expansion of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) and is facilitated by a westward expansion of the Indian Ocean (IO) warm pool. Mechanistically, the westward expansion of ISMR is a consequence of the episodic genesis over IO and the northward propagation of an expanded Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone on a sub-seasonal time scale. While an adaptation strategy to increased hydrological disasters is a must, harnessing the augmented rainfall would lead to a substantial boost in food productivity, bringing transformative changes in the socio-economic condition of people in the region.

The effect is larger for long-maturity bonds and not solely driven by near-term flood risk. We use a structural model of credit risk to quantify the implied economic impact and distinguish between the effects of underlying asset values and of uncertainty. The SLR exposure premium exhibits a trend different from house prices and is unaffected by house price controls. Together, our results highlight the importance of climate uncertainty in driving municipal bond prices.

We find that flooding led to reductions in employment (of about 4%) and average wages (of about 2%) among the affected businesses. The effects were substantially larger and more persistent in some parts of the city (Brooklyn and Queens) than others (Manhattan). Heterogeneity across boroughs reflects differences in the severity of flooding, building types and industry composition. The effects of flooding also vary by industry and businesses in sectors involved in rebuilding after the storm experienced employment growth. Flooding also led to establishment closings and relocation to other neighborhoods, which is a form of adaptation to increased flood risk.

However, dams have extensively altered global river dynamics, including riverine connectivity, hydrological, thermal, sediment and solute regimes, and the channel morphology. These alterations have detrimental effects on the quality and quantity of fish habitat and associated impacts on aquatic life. Indeed, dams have been implicated in the decline of numerous fishes, emphasizing the need for effective conservation measures. Here, we present a global synthesis of critical issues concerning the impacts of river damming on physical fish habitats, with a particular focus on key fish species across continents. We also consider current fish conservation measures and their applicability in different contexts. Finally, we identify future research needs. The information presented herein will help support sustainable dam operation under the constraints of future climate change and human needs. River damming yields great social-economic benefits, but also causes significant eco-environmental impacts, particularly on fish. Dams block fish migration routes, alter hydrological and water temperature regimes, and modify channel morphology. These changes impact fish physical habitats and associated communities. Here, we synthesize the impacts of river damming on fish physical habitats, and review potential conservation measures that could be used to off-set or mitigate the impacts of dams on fish habitats, populations and communities. Dam construction alters river hydro-geomorphological conditions and hence influences fish habitat quality and quantityKnowledge of river hydrogeomorphology and reservoir properties can inform which conservation measures may benefit fish conservationLong-term monitoring is needed to understand causal effects and synergies with climate change	[Chen, Qiuwen; Lin, Yuqing; Zhang, Jianyun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Yangtze Inst Conservat & Green Dev, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiuwen; Lin, Yuqing] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiuwen; Li, Qinyuan; Lin, Yuqing; He, Shufeng; Feng, Tao; Chen, Yuchen; Yan, Hanlu] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Ctr Ecoenvironm Res, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jun] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn Sc, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ni, Jinren] Peking Univ, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Best, Jim] Univ Illinois, Dept Earth Sci & Environm Change, Urbana, IL USA; [Best, Jim] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & GIS, Urbana, IL USA; [Best, Jim] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech Sci & Engn, Urbana, IL USA; [Best, Jim] Univ Illinois, Ven Te Chow Hydrosyst Lab, Urbana, IL USA; [Tonina, Daniele] Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, Boise, ID USA; [Benjankar, Rohan] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Civil Engn Dept, Edwardsville, IL USA; [Birk, Sebastian] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Biol, Aquat Ecol, Essen, Germany; [Birk, Sebastian] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Water & Environm Res, Essen, Germany; [Fleischmann, Ayan Santos] Mamiraua Inst Sustainable Dev, Tefe, Brazil; [Tang, Lei] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Coll Water Resources, Zhengzhou 450045, Peoples R China	Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute; Wuhan University; Peking University; Carleton University; Carleton University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Idaho; University of Idaho; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power	Chen, QW; Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Yangtze Inst Conservat & Green Dev, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Chen, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul Eng, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Chen, QW (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Ctr Ecoenvironm Res, Nanjing, Peoples R China.	qwchen@nhri.cn; jyzhang@nhri.cn	; Best, Jim/P-8440-2015	Ni, Jinren/0000-0002-9114-8347; Best, Jim/0000-0001-5314-6140	National Key Program of Science and Technology of China [2022YFC3203900]; National Key Program of Science and Technology [52121006, 92047303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China	National Key Program of Science and Technology of China; National Key Program of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported by National Key Program of Science and Technology (2022YFC3203900), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52121006, 92047303).

Increasing sea-surface temperature, sea-level rise and water-related disasters associated with climate change have been shown to influence the proliferation of these bacteria and change their geographic distribution. We investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of Vibrio spp. in a tropical lake for 1 year at a 20-day interval. The abundance of Vibrio spp. was much higher during the south-west monsoon in 2018, when the lake experienced a once-in-a-century flood. The distribution of Vibrio spp. was influenced by salinity (r = 0.3, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 0.18, p < 0.01) and nitrite (r = 0.16, p < 0.02) in the water. We isolated 470 colonies of Vibrio-like organisms and 341 could be revived further and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Functional annotations showed that all the 16 Vibrio spp. found in the lake could grow in association with animals. More than 60% of the isolates had multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.5. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin and cefepime. The proliferation of multiple antibiotic-resistant Vibrio spp. is a threat to human health. Our observations suggest that the presence of a diverse range of Vibrio spp. is favoured by the low-saline conditions brought about by heavy precipitation. Furthermore, infections caused by contact with Vibrio-contaminated waters may be difficult to cure due to their multiple antibiotic resistances. Therefore, continuous monitoring of bacterial pollution in the lakes is essential, as is the generation of risk maps of vibrio-infested waters to avoid public contact with contaminated waters and associated disease outbreaks.

J	Ghosh, S; Mistri, B				Ghosh, Soumen; Mistri, Biswaranjan			Analyzing the multi-hazard coastal vulnerability of Matla-Bidya inter-estuarine area of Indian Sundarbans using analytical hierarchy process and geospatial techniques	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Environmental disasters; Potential impact; Coastal vulnerability; Analytical hierarchy process; Resilience	FREQUENCY RATIO MODEL; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; MANGROVE FORESTS; WEST-BENGAL; FUZZY-LOGIC; EAST-COAST; BANGLADESH; GIS	In the current global climate change era, the Indian Sundarbans Delta (ISD) is severely exposed to multiple environmental disasters especially high-intensity tropical cyclones, storm surges and flood inundation. These disasters threaten the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities. To formulate a disaster risk reduction strategy, it is necessary to identify priority areas based on their level of vulnerability. Therefore, this research aims to assess the multi-hazard coastal vulnerability of the Matla-Bidya Inter-estuarine (MBI) area of ISD considering exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability. The coastal vulnerability was derived in this study based on a total of 26 indicators using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in combination with remote sensing data and geospatial techniques. To better understand the impacts of recent natural disasters, a field survey was conducted in each village from 2020 to 2021 to collect information directly from households regarding the effects of recent disasters on the different aspects of livelihoods. The present study found that the coastal villages in the Basanti and Gosaba Blocks located within the southern MBI are the most vulnerable due to coastal proximity, tropical cyclones, storm surges and flooding incidents. The high exposure and sensitivity cause potential effects on coastal environments and a lack of resistance to environmental disasters, leading to a considerable increase in coastal vulnerability. Local people's livelihoods are at risk in almost 33% of MBI villages. In contrast, villages in the northern MBI, in the Canning II Block are less susceptible to the effects of extreme events due to better resilience. This village-level multi-hazard vulnerability study helps to identify priority areas considering the vulnerability level of each village and accordingly proposed effective strategic planning for environmental and socio-economic resilience.

J	Liu, CC; Lu, QB; Zhang, Q				Liu, Chengcheng; Lu, Qibin; Zhang, Qiang			An empirical study of the effect of a flooding event caused by extreme rainfall on preventive behaviors against COVID-19	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						the COVID-19; preventive behaviors; flood risk perception; response to flood risk; social capital; community disaster preparedness	RISK PERCEPTION; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; INTERVENTION; RESIDENTS	Since the outbreak of COVID-19, wearing masks, vaccinations, and maintaining a safe distance has become social behaviors advocated by the government and widely adopted by the public. At the same time, unpredictable natural disaster risks brought by extreme climate change compound difficulties during epidemics and cause systemic risks that influence the existing pattern of epidemic prevention. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the effect of natural disaster risk caused by climate change on the response to outbreaks in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. This study will focus on individual-level epidemic prevention behaviors, taking as an example the significant risk of severe destructive flooding caused by heavy rains in Henan, China, on July 20, 2021, which claimed 398 lives, to explore the effect of floods on the preventive behaviors of residents in the hardest hit areas against COVID-19. Through the multi-stage stratified random sampling of the affected residents in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Hebi, Luoyang, Anyang, and other cities in Henan Province, 2,744 affected people were surveyed via questionnaires. Through the linear regression model and moderating effect analysis, the study found that after floods, the individual's flood risk perception and response behaviors significantly correlated with the individual's prevention behaviors against COVID-19. Specifically, both flood risk perception and response behaviors strengthened the individual's prevention behaviors. Furthermore, the study also found that community risk preparation behavior and social capital can moderate the above relationship to a certain extent. The research can guide risk communication under the compound risk scenario and prevent risky public behavior under the consistent presence of COVID-19 in the community.

High resolution inventory and hazard assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes in upper Jhelum basin, Kashmir Himalaya, India	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Climate change; Glacial Lake Inventory; LISS-IV; PDGLs; Upper Jhelum basin; Kashmir Himalaya	MOUNT EVEREST REGION; JAMMU-AND-KASHMIR; OUTBURST FLOOD; GARHWAL-HIMALAYA; CHANGING CLIMATE; PEAK DISCHARGE; CHANDRA BASIN; CLASSIFICATION; BHUTAN; RECONSTRUCTION	In the Himalayan Mountain region, a large number of glacial lakes have developed in the recent past due to glacier recession under the influence of climate change. In this study, we used high resolution satellite data such as Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS-IV (5.8 m) and Google earth images supplemented with field survey to generate an updated glacial lake inventory of Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB) of Kashmir Himalaya. The Sentinel-2A (10 m), Landsat-OLI (30 m) and MSS (60 m), and Cartosat-DEM (30 m) were additional data sources used for glacial lake mapping and change detection analysis. A total of 393 glacial lakes covering an area of 21.55 +/- 3.8 km(2) were identified, mapped and inventoried. The lake inventory includes 102 proglacial lakes, 13 supraglacial lakes and 278 unconnected glacial lakes. Using the weighted index-based method, 21 glacial lakes were found as Potentially Dangerous Glacial Lakes (PDGLs). Out of these, 7 lakes were classified as High, 9 as Medium and 5 as Low hazard glacial lakes as per the hazard assessment. Change detection analysis of PDGLs from 1980 to 2020 revealed an increase in area from 5.92 km(2) to 8.46 km(2) thereby, indicating a growth of 2.51 +/- 0.9 km(2)(30%) at a rate of 0.063 km(2)/year. The formation and growth of glacial lakes in this area is attributed to continuous glacier recession under the warming trend of temperature and declining nature of precipitation. In this study, the findings showed that T-avg and T-min are rising significantly at a rate of 0.004oC/year and 0.013oC/year respectively. This study provides an important database for future GLOF studies in the region.

To inform adaptation planning, we quantified the effects of incremental relative sea-level rise (RSLR) on exposed land area, number and replacement value of buildings within Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. The assessment compared three coastal hazards: flooding, permanent inundation and erosion. Increasingly frequent coastal flooding will be the dominant trigger for adaptation in Tauranga. In the absence of adaptation, coastal flooding, recurring at least once every 5 years on average, will overtake erosion as the dominant coastal hazard after about 0.15-0.2 m RSLR, which is likely to occur between the years 2038-2062 in New Zealand and will rapidly escalate in frequency and consequence thereafter. Coastal erosion will remain the dominant hazard for the relatively-few properties on high-elevation coastal cliffs. It will take 0.8 m more RSLR for permanent inundation to reach similar impact thresholds to coastal flooding, in terms of the number and value of buildings exposed. For buildings currently within the mapped 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) zone, the flooding frequency will transition to 20% AEP within 2-3 decades depending on the RSLR rate, requiring prior adaptive action. We also compared the performance of simple static-planar versus complex dynamic models for assessing coastal flooding exposure. Use of the static-planar model could result in sea level thresholds being reached 15-45 years earlier than planned for in this case. This is compelling evidence to use dynamic models to support adaptation planning.

It possibly sustained the Harappan civilization in the Indian subcontinent. This river has been studied as a part of the Ghaggar-Satluj-Hakra-Nara channel system in India and Pakistan. This study investigated its independent existence and evolution in the Himalayan foothill terrain and the proximal alluvial plains. Use of satellite imagery, shuttle radar topography mission data, accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating and optically stimulated luminescence chronology is being made to identify the possible palaeo-path of this ancient river and to characterize the trench sediment log architecture of the Saraswati River palaeochannels in northern India (Haryana). Our investigations reveal that this river formed a dense web of interconnecting channels which are continuously networked for more than 2,984 km in Haryana and their individual floodplain width varies from 1.5 to 13 km. The Harappan settlements in Haryana and Rajasthan nucleated and prospered in the fertile channel bars and interfluves of this river system. Majority of these habitation sites were located within a radius of less than 500 m from these palaeo-water channel networks. Enormous amount of water was flowing through this channel network until BC 11,147. Sediment characteristics and their chronology reveal that flow of water in the river channel decreased with time as the glacial cover diminished. The varying thickness of clay beds in sediment logs is indicative of the fluctuations in water flow possibly as a consequence of terrain slope modifications and consequent gradual channel avulsion, climate change, and global drought events. The flow of water continued through the Himalayan foothill input channels of the palaeo-Saraswati River in Haryana until AD 1402.

Seven streamflow gauge stations, with at least 27-year daily records, are used to characterize annual maximum 1- and 2-day flows and annual minimum 1-, 7-, and 30-day flows. The generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) are used to dynamically detect evolution of probability distributions of the maximum and minimum flow indices with time. Results of time-covariate models indicate that stationarity is only noted in the 4 maximum flow indices out of 35 indices. This phenomenon indicates that the minimum flow indices are vulnerable to changing environments. A 16-category distributional-change scheme is employed to classify distributional changes of flow indices. A probabilistic distribution with complex variations of mean and variance is prevalent in the Tamsui River basin since approximate one third of flow indices (34.3%) belong to this category. To evaluate impacts of dams on streamflow regime, a dimensionless index called the reservoir index (RI) serves as an alternative covariate to model nonstationary probability distribution. Results of RI-covariate models indicate that 7 out of 15 flow indices are independent of RI and 80% of the best-fitted RI-covariate models are generally worse than the time-covariate models. This fact reveals that the dam is not the only factor in altering the streamflow regime in the Tamsui River, which is a significant alteration, especially the minimum flow indices. The obtained distributional changes of flow indices clearly indicate changes in probability distributions with time. Non-stationarity in the Tamsui River is induced by climate change and complex anthropogenic interferences.

Reduced fitness can affect the reproductive performance and lead to skipped spawning. Benchmarking the threshold fitness required for a fish population to achieve readiness for spawning, and understanding how climatic parameters influence the fitness will aid in predicting the fate of its reproductive success in future climatic conditions. This study determined the threshold condition factor pre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) at which 50% of the femaleChanna punctatapopulation can be deemed fit for spawning. The optimal climate within which pre-spawning fitness is attained by this species under Indian climatic conditions was also identified. The study was conducted from June 2015 to September 2016, covering two spawning seasons (June-August) in a Gangetic floodplain wetland of West Bengal, India. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method (survival fit) was used for estimation of pre-spawning fitness. "Ready to spawn" females were classified based on binary coding of the gonadal maturity stages. The thermal and precipitation range within which spawning fitness is achieved was identified by using the locally weighted smoothing technique. FemaleC. punctatapre-spawning fitness (K-spawn50) ranged from 1.26 to 1.39 with an estimated median of 1.29 units. Temperatures between 29 and 32 degrees C and rainfall above 100 mm were conducive to attaining the requisite pre-spawning fitness inC. punctata.

Cenotes (sinkholes) and coastal caves have been shown to record the paleohydrology of the aquifer, but there is little information on sedimentation in these cave systems and its response to climate change. Newly developed mu XRF instrumentation for the analysis of cores can achieve subannual resolution due to small measurement increments, but short period studies examining weathering inputs and rainfall have not yet been undertaken, hindering paleoenvironmental interpretations of lake and cave sediment records. This study examines the spatial and temporal relationship of cave sediment geochemistry in the anchialine cave system of Yax Chen (Quintana Roo, Mexico). Sediment traps (n = 51) were placed at seventeen stations along the 2.7 km flooded cave system, which transitions from mangrove to upland forest terrain, with cenotes of variable size and frequency along its length. Sediment traps were collected every similar to 6 months from May 2013 May 2017 along with rainfall and groundwater level data. There are distinct responses of lithogenic (Fe, Ti, Sr - limestone weathering) and biogenic influenced (Si, K, S - phytoplankton and mangrove sediment) elements in the sediment samples associated with seasonal rainfall and hurricanes. While lithogenic elements (Ti/K) show a direct relationship seasonal rainfall, the sedimentation of biologically influenced (Si/Ti) elements exhibit a 6-12 month lagged response with large rainfalls such as Hurricane Ingrid in 2013 and other tropical storms throughout the study period.

J	Dunkerley, D				Dunkerley, David			How does sub-hourly rainfall intermittency bias the climatology of hourly and daily rainfalls? Examples from arid and wet tropical Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						arid rainfall climatology; Australia; daily rainfall; hourly rainfall; rainfall event; wet tropical rainfall climatology	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; FOWLERS GAP; INTENSITY; EVENTS; SIMULATION; FREQUENCY; PATTERN; TRENDS	Statistical rainfall climatologies for application to problems in ecohydrology or urban flood hydrology employ indices such the average rainfall depth per rain day or rain hour, and the average daily or hourly rainfall intensity. These subsume fine-temporal-scale aspects of rainfall arrival such as sub-hourly intermittency that vary among locations with different climatic conditions. Rainfall duration and intensity derived from data aggregated to hourly or daily level thus involve some bias, generally overestimating the duration of rainfall and underestimating rainfall rates, and this bias will vary with location. The magnitude of bias is documented for two Australian locations having rainfall records of high temporal resolution: one arid and one wet tropical. Rainfall data aggregated to hourly or daily level yield substantial overestimates of time raining, and underestimates of rainfall rates. The magnitude of bias is shown to differ between the two field locations where on average rain is only recorded during 3.6 hr (14.9%) of a rain day at the arid location, but 8.2 hr (34%) at the wet tropical site. Resulting bias in estimates of time raining and of rainfall intensities is worse at the arid location. The significance of intermittency in particular for the detection of the effects of climate change on temporal rainfall climatology is explored. If intermittency varies with climate change, but is concealed through the use temporally aggregated rainfall data, erroneous assessments of changes in rainfall intensities may result. The use of rainfall events rather than clock-period data appears to reduce some of these effects, but there is still a failure to reflect short-period,high-intensity rainfall that may be important to soil erosion and the loss of carbon, nutrients, and agrochemicals from agricultural land.

Notably, severe flood damage has been occurring in Asia along the Pacific coast due to extreme weather events, including torrential rains and typhoons, which have been becoming increasingly frequent and prolonging the rainy season. In the Eastern Visayas region, the management and monitoring facilities for flood observation data, as well as the forecasting and warning systems suitable for the local area, are insufficient. The warning system introduced through overseas grants is limited in operation in some areas of the city. Furthermore, although an organization has jurisdiction over flood forecasting and warning, the system's operation is not systematic and is limited. Additionally, there is a shortage of technical manpower. In this study, we utilized deep learning models to forecast flood water levels in the CarayCaray Basin on Biliran Island, located in Eastern Visayas, the Philippines. Additionally, a flood risk classification was applied to evaluate the degree of risk associated with the predicted water levels. The predicted water levels for each model were compared with the observed water level data. The evaluation of the predictive performance of each model resulted in an NRMSE value of 9.48. Moreover, the accuracy of the DNN model was found to be the best among the flood water level prediction models. To implement the flood risk classification, we utilized extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and decision tree models. The application of these models resulted in an F1-score of 0.92 for the extreme gradient boost model, which exhibited the highest accuracy. With an increasing need for disaster (flood) management, AI-based predictive models are anticipated to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters and enhance disaster mitigation systems. Real-time collection of rainfall and water level data enables continuous learning. Furthermore, if a clear flood warning based on learned flood level patterns is issued, preemptive measures can be taken before intense flood damage occurs.

Population in floodplains or close to sea level increased in US but declined in some counties-especially among Black residents	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sea level rise; climate change indicator; climate refugee; redlining; social vulnerability; hazard zone		Previous studies estimating US population vulnerable to climate change have assumed that population is uniformly distributed within the geographical unit of analysis, typically a census block. That assumption overstates vulnerable population in places where people have avoided the most hazardous areas. After using independent samples of housing location and building footprints to validate a revised approach, this letter estimates the US population close to sea level and in floodplains based on the assumption that population in a hazard zone is proportional to the fraction of buildings in the hazard zone, for the period 1990-2020. The building-based assumption reduces population estimates about 30%. Over the 30-year period, the US population below 1 m increased 14%-18% from 1.85 (+/- 0.19) million in 1990 to 2.2 (+/- 0.25) million; population below 3 m increased 31%. Sea level rise accounts for 75% of the increase in population below 1 m, but only 14% of the increase below 3 m. Nevertheless, in 21 counties, net emigration from land below 1 m was greater than 1% of county population. Although this emigration was particularly great in the 2000s after Hurricane Katrina, it totaled 170 000 for the entire 30-year period. Similarly, the US population of inland 100-year floodplains increased 7%, but several hundred counties saw a steady emigration throughout the 30-year period which totaled about 240 000. Black residents accounted for 19% of the population below 1 m but only 12% of the nation's population in 2020, meaning that Black residents were 63% more likely to live below 1 m than the general population nationwide. This disproportionality is more attributable to high Black populations in the most vulnerable localities (especially New Orleans) than to historic segregation. Black people also are almost five times as likely to have emigrated from land below 1 m than the general population since 1990.

J	Markanday, A; Galarraga, I				Markanday, Ambika; Galarraga, Ibon			The cognitive and experiential effects of flood risk framings and experience, and their influence on adaptation investment behaviour	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Flood risk; Risk communication; Lab experiment	GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; PLACE ATTACHMENT; POLICY PREFERENCES; NATURAL HAZARDS; PERCEPTIONS; COMMUNICATION; MITIGATION; RESPONSES	This study explores how decision makers invest in adaptation to protect against flood risks in response to a) different framings of flood risk information, and b) after experiencing losses from a hypothetical flood event. An incentivised economic lab experiment is conducted on a sample of students in Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain). A 2 x 2 between-subject design is used to measure investment behaviour with and without exposure to a flood risk map and after exposure to impacts framed as economic losses versus number of persons affected. Experience is measured through a 2-period repeated game within-subject design. Flood risk maps and impacts framed as number of persons affected were conducive to more experiential forms of decision-making, while decisions based on impacts framed as economic losses were more cognitive in nature. Those that saw text-only framings used a combination of cognitive and experiential factors for making decisions. While exposure to maps evoked more affect-driven responses, they were associated with lower ratings of positive affect and self-efficacy, and resulted in lower investments in protection compared to text-only framings. Greater experiential processing was found for impact framings based on persons affected, but they were not especially effective at increasing personal relevance of the issue or in driving investments. Individuals who experienced losses from a hypothetical flood event had greater ratings of negative affect, and made subsequent decisions that were more affect-driven in nature. In contrast, individuals who did not experience losses had greater ratings of positive affect, and made subsequent decisions based on primarily cognitive factors. Investments in protection reduced for those who did not experience losses, and remained the same for those who did experience losses. Results suggest that changes in adaptation investments between decision points may be dependent on both the experience (or lack thereof) of losses, as well as the extent to which individuals were risk-averse or risk-taking in previous investment decisions.

Gender-Related Differences in Flood Risk Perception and Behaviours among Private Groundwater Users in the Republic of Ireland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						flood risk; perception; gender; private groundwater; behaviour; psychology	ENTERIC DISEASE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COLI VTEC; WATER; CONTAMINATION; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; COUNTRIES; HOUSEWORK; EQUALITY	Extreme weather events including flooding can have severe personal, infrastructural, and economic consequences, with recent evidence pointing to surface flooding as a pathway for the microbial contamination of private groundwater supplies. There is a pressing need for increasingly focused information and awareness campaigns to highlight the risks posed by extreme weather events and appropriate subsequent post-event actions. To date, little is known about the presence, directionality or magnitude of gender-related differences regarding flood risk awareness and behaviour among private groundwater users, a particularly susceptible sub-population due to an overarching paucity of infrastructural regulation across many regions. The current study investigated gender-related differences in flood risk perception and associated mitigation behaviours via a cross-sectional, national survey of 405 (168 female, 237 male) private groundwater supply users. The developed survey instrument assessed socio-demographic profile, previous flood experience, experiential and conjectural health behaviours (contingent on previous experience), and Risk, Attitude, Norms, Ability, Self-regulation (RANAS) framework questions. Statistically significant gender differences were found between both 'Norm-Descriptive' and 'Ability-Self-efficacy' RANAS elements (p < 0.05). Female respondents reported a lower level of awareness of the need for post-flood action(s) (8.9% vs. 16.5%), alongside a perceived "lack of information" as a reason for not testing their domestic well (4.9% vs. 11.5%). Conversely, male respondents were more likely to report awareness of their well location in relation to possible contamination sources (96.6% vs. 89.9%) and awareness of previous water testing results (98.9% vs. 93.0%). Gender-related gaps exist within the studied private groundwater reliant cohort, a sub-population which has to date remained under-studied within the context of climate change and extreme weather events. Accordingly, findings suggest that gender-focused communication and education may represent an effective tool for protecting current and future generations of global groundwater users.

We draw on the analysis of fluvial and surface water flooding across England and Wales in 2021 to highlight these areas of improvement. Already implemented improvements in both the underpinning science and our long lead-time product are described in the context of high-magnitude, high-impact floods. In addition, we consider more substantial developments from improved modelling of convection to translating this to surface water flood risk and to the essential communication and service provision. Finally, recognising that many of the challenges are shared internationally, we distil our key recommendations for future improvement. These improvements rely on collaboration for them to be successful.

Our results show that water transports through the three inlets connecting the Venice lagoon to the open sea are expected to change significantly, with consequent significant persistent alterations of the circulation and sea-level height inside the lagoon. The projected water mass redistributions motivate further studies on the implications of climate change for the lagoon environment.

This paper aims to evaluate the beneficial effect on urban flooding risk mitigation produced by applying RTC techniques to an urban drainage network by considering different control configuration scenarios. To achieve the aim, a distributed real-time system, validated in previous studies, was considered. This approach uses a smart moveable gates system, controlled by software agents, managed by a swarm intelligence algorithm. By running the different scenarios by a customized version of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), the findings obtained show a redistribution of conduits filling degrees, exploiting the whole system storage capacity, with a significant reduction of node flooding and total flood volume.

The study object was moderate size reservoir located in Nielisz in eastern Poland on Wieprz river. The analysis conducted for the hydrological period 1976-2014 showed a positive effect of the reservoir on compensating low flows. In gauging sections located below the reservoir, streamflow droughts almost completely disappeared. The anti-flood function is particularly evident in the case of small floods, and involves a delay in the occurrence of cumulative flow, without reduction in flood volumes. Mean flow fluctuations decreased, while environmental flows were continuously ensured.

Near real-time accurate rainfall information at fine spatial and temporal scale is important in the context of occurrence of recent flood events over the Indian region. Poor rain gauge and radar network limit this information over India. Satellites offer an opportunity to measure rainfall over India and the adjoining oceanic region. Available global rainfall products show poor performance for measuring rainfall over a topographically complex region like India. During the past few decades, efforts have been made to improve rainfall estimates over the Indian region. This study aims to provide a broad overview of these advancements, to emphasize on the evaluation of rainfall estimation techniques over India.

The North China Plain, modulated by the East Asian monsoon, is sensitive to global climate changes. However, its vegetation type and distribution during the Middle Holocene are still unclear. Based on the comprehensive analysis of 155 samples for pollen and grain sizes as well as other environmental proxies from the LD03 drill core, vegetation was reconstructed quantitatively using the REVEALS model during the period of 8.4-5.5 cal ka BP. (1) Compared to the pollen percentage, the coverage of Pinus (13.5%) decreased most significantly, while the coverage of Quercus increased significantly (51.3%). The proportion of Ephedra (11.9%) increased. A large area of temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests mainly with deciduous Quercus developed in the eastern coastal plain of Hebei from 8.0 ka BP to 5.5 ka BP. (2) During 7.4-7.1 ka BP, the proportion of broadleaved trees decreased significantly, while herbaceous plants such as Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae increased. Vegetation components such as Quercus and Pinus and Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae were sensitive to marine transgression. (3) The vegetation distribution during the Middle Holocene in the eastern and western regions of Hebei was mainly as follows: There was a large area of Pinus in the Taihang Mountains in western Hebei, whereas grasslands mainly composed of Asteraceae and Poaceae (reeds) developed in the floodplain of central Hebei. Coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests or temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests developed in the eastern coastal plain of Hebei. The possible mechanisms of vegetation heterogeneity are sea level rise and the enhanced monsoon precipitation.

A typology of responsibility for coastal flood risk adaptation	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal flood risk management; responsibility; adaptation; local stakeholders; disaster risk reduction	LOCAL STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; MITIGATION MEASURES; FEAR APPEALS; MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; UK; INSURANCE	The management of coastal flood risk is adapting to meet the challenges and increased risks posed by population change as well as by climate change, especially sea level rise. Protection is being targeted to areas where the benefits are highest, while elsewhere there is a shift towards more localized "living with floods" and "resilience" approaches. Such decentralized approaches to flood risk management (FRM) require a diverse range of stakeholder groups to be engaged as "flood risk citizens". Engagement of households in FRM is central to this process. Despite significant research on stakeholder engagement in coastal and flood risk management, there is less focus on the nature of responsibility in coastal adaptation. There is no framework by which to assess the different types of responsibility in hazard management and adaptation, and little research on the implications of expecting these responsibilities of stakeholder groups. In this paper, we identify five types of responsibility that are embedded throughout the disaster risk reduction cycle of managing coastal flooding. We build this "typology of responsibility" on existing work on the evolution of stakeholder engagement and stakeholder responsibility relationships in risk management processes, and a dataset of institutional stakeholder interviews and households surveys conducted across three case studies in England, the United Kingdom, in 2018 and 2019. We analyze the interviews using thematic analysis to explore institutional stakeholder perceptions of responsibility in coastal FRM, and analyze the household survey through descriptive and inferential statistics. By developing the first disaster risk reduction focused typology of responsibility for coastal flooding, we provide researchers and decision-makers with a tool to guide their planning and allocation of responsibilities in risk management for floods and other climate-driven hazards.

Modeling impacts of drought-induced salinity intrusion on carbon dynamics in tidal freshwater forested wetlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						carbon storage and fluxes; DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model; drought; saltwater intrusion; soil salinity; soil water level	ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; METHANE EMISSIONS; SOIL; GROWTH; SEQUESTRATION; HYDROLOGY; GRADIENT; RIVER; MINERALIZATION; ACCUMULATION	Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide critical ecosystem services including an essential habitat for a variety of wildlife species and significant carbon sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration.

Modifying soil properties with herbaceous plants for natural flood risk-reduction	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bioretention; Flood mitigation; Herbaceous species; Nature-based solutions; Soil hydrology; Soil-plant interactions; Root systems	INDUCED SUCTION; HYDROLOGIC REINFORCEMENT; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; WATER RETENTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ROOT SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; STABILITY; STRENGTH	Background and aim: Nature-based solutions to engineering challenges are essential to limit climate change impacts on the urban environment. Quantitative understanding of multiple "engineering functions" provided by soil-plant interactions of different species is needed for species selection and re-establishing natural processes affected by urbanisation. Methods: Contrasting herbaceous species (legumes, grasses, and forbs) were selected and grown as monoculture or species mix in soil columns for a five-month growing season. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was initially tested for each column, and then the columns were monitored for three-weeks of evapotranspiration. Water loss, matric suction, and penetrometer resistance were measured. Finally, soil was tested for aggregate stability and water retention. Results: Saturated hydraulic conductivity of vegetated soil was generally larger than that of fallow soil (6.9e-6 +/- 1.4e-6 m/s in fallow soil). Saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly different between species (e.g., from 9.9e-6 +/- 1.3e-6 m/s in Festuca ovina to 3.9e-5 +/- 1.2e-6 m/s in Lotus corniculatus) and was negatively correlated with specific root length. The water stored in the soil was efficiently removed by plant transpiration (> 60% of evapotranspiration). Large changes in soil structure were observed in vegetated soil, with significant increases in soil strength, aggregate stability, and alteration of water retention properties. Conclusions: Multiple soil-plant interactions influence species selection for optimising nature-based solutions (e. g., bioretention barriers).

In this paper, we describe a novel approach for modeling areal runoff frequency from heavy-to-extreme precipitation in large urban areas using a simple but general stochastic model for runoff at point scale and bi- and univariate parametric probability distributions for positive point precipitation and areal runoff, respectively. We apply the approach to the Dallas-Fort Worth area using a 22-year historical multisensor precipitation dataset from the National Weather Service to characterize how the different factors that specify the second-order statistics of precipitation, imperviousness and soil water holding capacity at point scale may shape areal runoff frequency, and to assess how changes in precipitation climatology and land surface conditions may change areal runoff frequency as a function of catchment scale and magnitude of precipitation. The results indicate that areal runoff frequency is impacted most significantly by changes in climatological mean and coefficient of variation of positive point precipitation, water holding capacity of soil, imperviousness, and spatial correlation scale of positive point precipitation given the probability of occurrence of heavy-to-extreme precipitation, and that a very small number of low-order statistics of point precipitation may describe areal runoff frequency given the conditional probability distribution models for point precipitation and areal runoff. The approach presented hence offers a parsimonious physically-based alternative to purely numerical approaches based on integrated modeling, or empirical approaches based solely on statistical modeling toward predictive modeling of areal precipitation and runoff frequencies under changing hydroclimatological conditions.

This study, therefore, assessed the usefulness of Zimbabwe's disaster legislation in reducing disaster risk/losses. The study used 27 semi-structured interviews with disaster experts. The findings revealed that the legislation is largely promoting a reactionary approach to disasters in a top-down manner. The study concludes that for disaster legislations to be adequate guiding frameworks for reducing disaster risks and losses, they need to be backed by clear funding mechanisms, which would allow investing in resilience.

Madden-Julian oscillation changes under anthropogenic warming	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							STATIC ENERGY BUDGET; ENHANCED MJO; INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BASIC-STATE; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; MODULATION; ENSO	The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) produces a region of enhanced precipitation that travels eastwards along the Equator in a 40-50 day cycle, perturbing tropical and high-latitude winds, and thereby modulating extreme weather events such as flooding, hurricanes and heat waves. Here, we synthesize current understanding on projected changes in the MJO under anthropogenic warming, demonstrating that MJO-related precipitation variations are likely to increase in intensity, whereas wind variations are likely to increase at a slower rate or even decrease. Nevertheless, future work should address uncertainties in the amplitude of precipitation and wind changes and the impacts of projected SST patterns, with the aim of improving predictions of the MJO and its associated extreme weather.

Through discussion of the colonial creation of a Brazilian city in the Atlantic Forest, and the concurrent creation of vulnerability to floods and landslides, it suggests that calls for 'better' citizenship-without a fundamental reappraisal of its ecological content-are likely to reproduce hazardous urban environments. The article aims to bring work from citizenship studies and urban political ecology into productive dialogue through a provocative case study, in order to explore the overlaps between the power of the modern, liberal, state and visions of nature as 'outside' the city.

Research on carbohydrate consumption, ethanolic and lactic acid fermentation, and their regulation under stress conditions has been accompanied by investigations on aerenchyma development and the emergence of the radial oxygen loss barrier in some plant species under flooded conditions. The discovery of the oxygen-sensing mechanism in plants and unravelling the intricacies of this mechanism have boosted this very international research effort. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of oxygen availability as a signalling component during plant development. The latest developments in determining actual oxygen concentrations using minute probes and molecular sensors in tissues and even within cells have provided new insights into the intracellular effects of flooding. The information amassed during recent years has been used in the breeding of new flood-tolerant crop cultivars. With the wealth of metabolic, anatomical, and genetic information, novel holistic approaches can be used to enhance crop species and their productivity under increasing stress conditions due to climate change and the subsequent changes in the environment. With flooding events increasing due to climate change, the low oxygen tolerance of plants has become a very important research topic that has evolved thanks to research effort and recent progress.

Towards a combined human-natural system approach in the Northern Red Sea Region: Ecological challenges, sustainable development, and community engagement	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Red sea; Development; Coral reefs; Blue architecture; climate change	REMOTE-SENSING DATA; CORAL-REEF; HALOPHILA-STIPULACEA; SEAGRASS COMMUNITIES; SHORELINE CHANGES; STABLE-ISOTOPE; FLASH FLOODS; GULF; IMPACT; LEVEL	The northern Red Sea coastal ecosystem is one of the most diverse coastal ecosystems in the world. Fortunately, it has shown extraordinary resilience against climate change and is predicted to survive global warming during the coming decades. However, with warming waters, increased sediment and pollutants, and other human impacts, the ecosystem and consequently thriving reef tourism which forms a pillar of the ongoing economic diversification policies of the northern Red Sea region are under threat. A variety of evidence indicates significant damage has already been done to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems on both sides of the northern Red Sea. Expenditures on ecosystem protection and research lag behind Egypt's billions in USD revenue from tourism. Unfortunately, the economic drive to generate profit has resulted in sprawling touristic, industrial, and mixed development without careful planning or assessment of the fragility and sustainability of the natural ecosystem. As a result, the future of coastal urban growth is murky. Given its natural, social, and touristic value, the northern Red Sea system requires a special ecological security system with detailed analysis, inclusive development, and proactive governance across coastal cities and their adjacent inland secondary cities. This study identifies the geological research gaps, human-ecological interactions, inclusive urban development challenges, and related literature pertaining to the northern Red Sea. We propose immediate, targeted, multidisciplinary research trajectories and provide policy recommendations to ensure that the region's existing and future developmental pursuits are undertaken in an environmentally sustainable and inclusive approach.

Along with changes in land use and land cover, this relationship may become more complex. Thus, the present study aimed to detect recent trends in the pattern of rainfall indicators and associate them with records of natural disasters and the evolution of changes in land use and land cover for the state of Espirito Santo, southeastern Brazil. Daily rainfall data from 77 rain gauge stations from 1970 to 2018 were used to analyze climate trends in different rainfall indicators obtained using the RClimDex software. Records of natural disasters from 1991 to 2020 in the state of Espirito Santo were gathered from the Brazilian Integrated Disaster Information System. Additionally, land use and land cover data from 1985 and 2019 were also used. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the Sen slope were used to detect and quantify trends. In the Litoral Norte Espirito-santense and Noroeste Espirito-santense mesoregions of the State, trends of drought intensification are expected mainly in the regions further north. Associated with the great recent agricultural expansion in the region, this trend is concerning. The Central Espirito-santense and Sul Espirito-santense mesoregions tend to become wetter, which explains the recent increase in floods and heavy rainfall.

The approach adopted in this study has the potential to assist decision-making, implement mitigation and/or adaptation measures, and reduce the impacts of natural disasters in different regions of the world.

J	Yi, CS; Chen, ZM; Chen, HC				Yi, Changsheng; Chen, Zhaoming; Chen, Hongchen			Opportunity knocks but just once: Impact of infrastructure investment decision on climate adaptation to flood events	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Flood risk; Investment timing; Bayesian inference; Insurance premium	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; OPERATIONAL RISK; REAL OPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; INSURANCE; MODEL; REINSURANCE; STRATEGIES; PATHWAYS	Extreme natural disasters caused by climate change and socio-economic development, such as floods, are likely to occur more frequently and impose an increasing threat on the safety of people's lives and property around the world. The infrastructure investment of adaptation projects can effectively prevent and mitigate these climate impacted disaster risks, as well as reducing the catastrophic losses. In this paper, we propose an economic evaluation framework to incorporate risk preferences and investment timing for making climate adaptation. We use an extended loss distribution approach (LDA) to estimate the expected economic loss (EEL) of flood events with different levels, in which the Bayesian inference is integrated to estimate the parameters of loss severity distributions. The modeling framework is applied to a case study of flood risk management in Nanjing City, China. We find that the appropriate delay of investment timing can significantly increase the value of the adaptation project. The optimal investment timing is earlier, and the project value under optimal investment timing is higher, when the risk aversion coefficient of insurance company or the asset growth rate becomes higher. A lower discount rate or a lower investment cost will accelerate the optimal investment timing. Interestingly, we also find that the greater the difference between the discount rate and the asset growth rate, the higher the value of the adaptation project under the optimal investment timing. These findings are expected to provide useful information on flood disasters prevention for the investment decision of adaptation infrastructure which can be economically effective to integrate the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development.

Typically, HMRs are exacerbated by rapid urban development, ecosystem degradation, and water use changes. All though data is scarce and scattered, evidencebased case studies have shown that implementing Nature-based Solutions (NBS) can reduce HMR. With further influence from anthropogenic climate change and continuing ecosystem degradation, HMH are projected to increase in frequency and severity. Consequently, NBS implemented for HMR reduction will have to be robust enough to deal with HMHs that exceed their design criteria and/or expected performance. However, currently available literature does not adequately outline processes that aid in designing and evaluating of robust NBS for HMR reduction. In response to this gap in literature, this study developed a process for designing and evaluating robust NBS for water. In the present study, robust design of a NBS for water is illustrated using an existing flood risk management system and NBS (100-year-old traditional irrigation furrows) in an agricultural area situated within the floodplain of the Chao Phraya River basin in the Pathum Thani province, Thailand. The robustness of the existing NBS for water is then evaluated through robust design and quantified through the construction of a responsive curve. Once the robustness of the existing NBS for water is quantified, an iterative process is used to enhance individual characteristics of the flood risk management system - resulting in efficient use of the flood water storage capacity offered by the existing NBS.

Large wood loads in channels and on floodplains after a 500-year flood using UAV imagery in Mark Twain National Forest, Ozark Highlands, Missouri	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Floods; Riparian forests; Missouri Ozarks; Fluvial geomorphology; UAV imagery	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; RIVER-BASIN; TREE MORTALITY; STREAM POWER; DEBRIS; DISTURBANCE; IMPACTS; RECRUITMENT; LANDSCAPE	Anthropogenic climate change has increased the frequency of large floods in rivers draining the Ozark Highlands. This study assesses the effects of a > 500-yr flood in spring 2017 on riparian forests and large wood loads in the North Fork of the White River watershed, Missouri, for six stream reaches with drainage areas from 5 to 124 km2. Standing trees and large wood (LW) were assessed using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and calibrated by field surveys. Scaled flood magnitude (flood stage/bankfull depth) correlated with percent urban and agri-cultural land above each reach suggesting that land use may have contributed to forest damage. Canopy loss on the valley floor ranged from 7 to 63 % by reach and correlated with mean and cross-sectional stream power (p < 0.01). Standing tree density after the flood ranged from 50 to 243 trees/ha. The density of LW pieces ranged from 25 to 147 trees/ha. Most LW was aligned with stream flow, not in jams, and located on floodplains below riffles or bar heads, along channel bends, or in chutes. Wood loads on the valley floor increased downstream from 12 to 45 m3/ha. Channel loads were < 30 m3/ha while floodplain, terrace, and chute loads were > 30 m3/ha at drainage areas >50 km2. Channel LW loads increased with flood magnitude and in narrow valleys (p < 0.02), but not drainage area. Increased wood storage occurred on floodplains and terraces, but it is not clear if the stored wood will be available for downstream transport by future floods.	[Pavlowsky, R. T.; Hess, J.

Responding to flood risk in Louisiana: the roles of place attachment, emotions, and location	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Risk communication; Protection motivation theory; Flood risk; Coastal land loss; Louisiana; Climate change	PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; FEAR APPEALS; PERCEPTION; BEHAVIOR; SENSE; EXPERIENCE; COMMUNITY; ATTITUDE	Drawing from protection motivation theory (PMT), we examined how place attachment and negative emotions, alongside threat and coping appraisals, personal experiences, and demographic characteristics, relate to behavioral intentions to mitigate exposure to flood risks in southern Louisiana. We administered a statewide, representative telephone survey to 807 Louisiana residents, oversampling residents living in southern and coastal parishes particularly vulnerable to flood risk. While the results showed no difference depending on participants' location in the state, there were strong effects of coping appraisals on individuals' intentions to mitigate their exposure to flood risk, consistent with prior PMT findings. The addition of place attachment to standard PMT variables revealed a nuanced relationship with behavioral intentions. Results show that participants' place attachment decreased the effects of threat and coping appraisals on some behavioral intentions, such as moving out of the state, while posing no significant effect of threat and coping appraisals on other intentions, such as supporting flood risk mitigation policies. Feeling negative emotions increased the likelihood of participants' indicating a willingness to move or elevate their home, among other actions. While this study supports the consistency of threat and coping appraisals to predict discrete behavioral intentions, the results also provide insight that may be critical for risk communication initiatives in Louisiana. Namely, individuals with high levels of place attachment may be less willing to leave their community but more willing to engage in behaviors that enhance community resilience, although the more negative emotions they feel, the more willing they may be to take more drastic measures.

Biomat Resilience to Desiccation and Flooding Within a Shallow, Unit Process Open Water Engineered Wetland	WATER			English	Article						engineered wetlands; disruption; resilience; nitrate; microbial resistance	TRACE ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REMOVAL; SYSTEMS; RISK; NITRATE; OXYGEN	Projections of increased hydrological extremes due to climate change heighten the need to understand and improve the resilience of our water infrastructure. While constructed natural treatment analogs, such as raingardens, wetlands, and aquifer recharge, hold intuitive promise for variable flows, the impacts of disruption on water treatment processes and outcomes are not well understood and limit widespread adoption. To this end, we studied the impact of desiccation and flooding extremes on demonstration-scale shallow, unit process open water (UPOW) wetlands designed for water treatment. System resilience was evaluated as a function of physical characteristics, nitrate removal, photosynthetic activity, and microbial ecology. Rehydrated biomat that had been naturally desiccated re-established nitrate removal consistent with undisrupted biomat in less than a week; however, a pulse of organic carbon and nitrogen accompanied the initial rehydration phase. Conversely, sediment intrusion due to flooding had a negative impact on the biomat's photosynthetic activity and decreased nitrate attenuation rates by nearly 50%. Based upon past mechanistic inferences, attenuation potential for trace organics is anticipated to follow similar trends as nitrate removal. While the microbial community was significantly altered in both extremes, our results collectively suggest that UPOW wetlands have potential for seasonal or intermittent use due to their promise of rapid re-establishment after rehydration. Flooding extremes and associated sediment intrusion provide a greater barrier to system resilience indicating a need for proactive designs to prevent this outcome; however, residual treatment potential after disruption could provide operators with time to triage and manage the system should a flood occur again.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Atopic dermatitis; Flood; Children; Climate change; Atopic diseases	DAMAGED HOMES; EXPOSURES; CHILDREN; HEALTH; RISK	Floods are known to increase the level of allergens such asmolds in the environments. Under climate change, the frequency of floods could be increased, which highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of floods on atopic diseases. However, there was a lack of studies. This study examines whether floods induce attacks of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD). A retrospective population-based study was conducted in Taiwan Island using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Emergency room(ER) visits for AD were identified among children aged 0-12 years. Weekly data of flood occurrence, number of flood sites, temperature, and air pollution were obtained for each township of the identified cases. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used. The relationship between ER visits for AD and floods was assessed by conditional logistic regression, adjusting for weekly mean temperature, PM2.5 and NO2. There were a total of 55,488 ER visits due to AD during the study period. Such visits increased when flood occurred, and then declined. The effects of floods at the week of flood remained robust, with OR of 1.14 (95% CI = 1.01-1.28) for flood occurrence and 1.31 (95% CI = 1.10-1.55) for the number of flood sites, after adjusting for covariates. Such effects were slightly higher in boys and children aged 1-12 years. This study demonstrated the impact of floods on flare-up of childhood AD, and the effect was most prominently at the week of flood. Healthcare workers should be alarmed for potential increase of AD flare ups after flood events. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Historical weather data of Fredericton (New Brunswick) and Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island), the two coastal cities of Atlantic Canada, were analyzed using RClimDex, Mann-Kendall test, and Sen's slope estimates for potential scenarios and causes of floods. Flood hazard analyses were conducted using GIS (Geographical Information System) and ArcSWAT software. The watersheds of Fredericton and Charlottetown were delineated from 25 x 25 m resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) of the two cities followed by percent watershed area calculations for different elevation classes for flood generation. Over the past 100 years, there was a significant decreasing trend in the high intensity precipitation in Charlottetown supported by a significant decrease in the number of heavy precipitation days. However, maximum one-day precipitation and maximum five-day precipitation significantly increased in Charlottetown and Fredericton, respectively. Charlottetown received more annual precipitation than Fredericton. In the last 30 years, there was an event exceeding 50 mm precipitation (considered as a threshold for the return period of urban floods) in Charlottetown; Fredericton experienced such events for more than 1.5 times. For twelve times, these events occurred more than once in a year in Charlottetown as compared to fourteen times in Fredericton. Despite statistically proven similarities in the occurrence of extreme events in the two cities, the visualized flood hazards, and the mapping of watershed characteristics, no devastating floods were reported for Charlottetown.

J	Dash, P; Punia, M				Dash, Pratik; Punia, Milap			Governance and disaster: Analysis of land use policy with reference to Uttarakhand flood 2013, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Uttarakhand flood; Policy; Risk governance; Hydrodynamic model; Flood management; Bhagirathi river	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; FLASH FLOODS; IMPACTS; RIVER; URBANIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; INTERPLAY; HAZARD; MODEL	The flood risks are crucially increasing in developing countries around the globe due to intense development activities and climate change. The extreme casualties and losses wrought by the flood events in June 2013 in the Uttarakhand (India) have raised the governance issues in policy-making and implementation for controlling human activities. Besides extreme rainfall, the unplanned development, weak legal framework and governance issues were claimed as responsible for triggering the disaster. The present study has evaluated the environmental aspects of existing policies related to regulate land use change and development activities when considered in relation to flooding. Analyzing the governance perspective by addressing policy, guidelines and mitigation strategies, this study highlighted the gaps in policies and practice that could be reshaped to reinforce resilience. This study also tried to delineate the high flood level and flood risk area along the Bhagirathi river using hydrological and hydrodynamic models for the event of 2013 that can assist in policy-making process. In summary, the study found that rampant construction at riverside in absence of effective building regulations and hydropower policy in the state has increased the magnitude of the disaster. The lack of multi-institutional coordination in formulating and practice of regulatory measures was found as a failure of governance in disaster preparedness and flood management. This study strongly suggests for compliance of local planning authorities and stakeholders with state and national policymakers for establishing collaborative governance. This article may help to bridge the gap between administrators and researcher for formulizing effective flood risk governance.

Extreme weather events, natural hazards, and the failure of climate mitigation and adaptation are substantial risks. These risks are especially significant in fast-urbanizing deltas, such as the Pearl River Delta in China, because the conflict between urbanization and flooding caused by climate change will be more significant in the future. This paper elaborates on an approach that employs a future land-use simulation (FLUS) model for scenario-based 100-year coastal flood risk assessment. Storylines of future scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), called the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5, are utilized in the present study. The Guangzhou Metropolitan Area (GMA) is used as a case study to explore the probable implications of future landuse changes due to the ongoing urbanization process in the region in relation to projected environmental changes (sea-level rise, storm surge, and land subsidence). The results indicate that there will be a significant increase in flooded urban areas in the future. The simulations show that, as compared to 2015, the built-up area in the GMA will increase by 246.57 km(2) in 2030 and 513.03 km(2) in 2050. As compared to 2015, the flooding of builtup areas in 2030 and 2050 will respectively increase by about 31.32 km(2) and 48.49 km(2) under the RCP 8.5 scenario. It is also found that, as the main driving factor, urbanization will increase the flooding of built-up areas in Guangzhou in 2030 and 2050 by about 1.9 km(2) and 5.9 km(2), respectively, under the RCP 2.6 scenario as compared to 2015. Additionally, due to environmental changes, the flooding of built-up areas in Guangzhou increase by about 24.2 km(2) and 26.8 km(2), respectively, under the RCP 8.5 scenario by 2030 and 2050 as compared to 2015. This increasing flood risk information determined by the simulation provides insight into the spatial distribution of future flood-prone urban areas to facilitate the development and prioritization of flood mitigation measures at the most critical locations in the region.

J	Kugler, Z; Horváth, VG				Kugler, Zsofia; Horvath, Viktor Gyozo			A comparison of river streamflow measurement from optical and passive microwave radiometry	IDOJARAS			English	Article						passive microwave radiometry; optical remote sensing; space hydrology; climate change impact; river gauge		Climate change has a crucial impact on the global energy and water cycle. The hydrological cycle can be studied both from ground and satellite measurements on a global scale. Yet a comprehensive overview is challenging to establish given the spatial and temporal limitations related to various Earth Observation satellite sensors or maintenance of in-situ gauges. Optical remote sensing of visible light can not overcome the substantial obstacle from cloud cover that vastly limits its capability in daily global monitoring. Active satellite sensors like SAR or altimetry are not capable to provide global coverage on a daily basis, therefore, they can be geographically limited. Passive microwave radiometry (PMR) can acquire both daily and global scales that enables the temporally frequent and spatially extensive observations of continental river gauge. Previous studies demonstrated the use of PMR measurements for global daily river gauge benefiting from its high sensitivity of microwave radiation to water presence. This study aims at comparing the methodology of PMR to optical river gauge measurements based on the assumption that at selected locations along the river channel, increase in streamflow is related to increase in the floodplain water surface inundation. Comparison showed a significant obstacle of cloud cover over tropical regions, where PMR has the potential to measure river streamflow. Yet over regions with less clouds both optical and PMR can be good alternative to in-situ streamflow ground measurements.

These processes occur by short and intense rainfall affecting limited areas of a few square kilometers, with rapid hydrological responses. Among the causes of the flood frequency increase in the last decades are the effects of the urban expansion in areas of fluvial pertinence and climatic change, namely the interaction between anthropogenic landforms and hydro-geomorphological dynamics. In this paper the authors show a comparison between flood events with very similar weather-hydrological characteristics and the ground effects occurred in coastal areas of three regions located at the top of a triangle in the Ligurian Sea, namely Liguria, Tuscany and Sardinia. With respect to the meteorological-hydrological hazard, it should be noted that the events analyzed occurred during autumn, in the conditions of a storm system triggered by cyclogenesis on the Genoa Gulf or by the extra-tropical cyclone Cleopatra. The "flash floods" damage recorded in the inhabited areas is due to the vulnerability of the elements at risk in the fluvio-coastal plains examined. There are numerous anthropogenic forcings that have influenced the hydro-geomorphological dynamics and that have led to an increase in risk conditions.

This is especially the case in informal settlements that have limited state engagement and are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Community-based adaptation (CBA) in the informal settlement has the potential to support the transformation that re-shapes power relations as well as reducing climate risk. This paper explores how multiscalar governance in Cape Town can either empower or undermine CBA to flooding in informal settlements. Drawing on urban political ecology, the analysis reveals significant tension around differing ideas of the temporality of informal settlements, as well as token community inclusivity in participatory planning processes. While everyday governance practices have been used by the City of Cape Town at the local scale, a local community-based organisation has used insurgent planning to envision and enact a more just city. A community designed and spear-headed reblocking process (rearranging shacks in a settlement to allow for flood drainage and service delivery) is a powerful example of CBA and represents the potential of community-based organisations to take steps towards transformative action. In order to enable more widespread urban transformative CBA, it is important to address the drivers of vulnerabilities and underlying power dynamics of political decision-making to destabilise the status quo and move towards real adaptation.

They can have negative implications for societies, including water security and agriculture. For example, changes in their duration and within-year timing can pose a threat to food production and wildfire risk. Conversely, wet spells are sequences of days with precipitation above a certain threshold, and changes in their duration and within-year timing can impact agriculture, flooding or the prevalence of water-related vector-borne diseases. Here we assess changes in the duration and within-year timing of extreme dry and wet spells over 60 years (1958-2017) using a consistent global land surface precipitation dataset of 5093 rain gauge locations. The dataset allowed for detailed spatial analyses of the United States, Europe and Australia. While many locations exhibit statistically significant changes in the duration of extreme dry and wet spells, the changes in the within-year timing are less often significant. Our results show consistencies with observations and projections from state-of-the-art climate and water resources research. In addition, we provide new insights regarding trends in the timing of extreme dry and wet spells, an aspect being equally important for possible future implications of extremes in a changing climate, which has not yet received the same level of attention and is characterized by larger uncertainty.

Urban climate resilience under racial capitalism: Governing pluvial flooding across Amsterdam and Dhaka	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Resilience; Climate urbanism; Racial capitalism; Environmental governance; Climate justice	EAST-INDIA-COMPANY; THINKING CITIES; MANAGEMENT; VOC; GEOGRAPHIES; RISK	This paper situates climate resilience as a solution to urban flooding under racial capitalism by examining its implementation across Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Dhaka, Bangladesh. The necessity for cities to enhance their climate resilience in the face of urban flooding has become a dominant refrain in the global governance of climate change. This is the case in both the Netherlands and Bangladesh, locations that are respectively and divergently framed as global "masters" of water management and needy "apprentices" requiring international guidance on flood control and economic development. I place these two sites in conversation with one another to break down constructed ontological and epistemological divides across the global North and global South, drawing attention to the relationship between contemporary urban climate resilience policies and broader histories of socio-ecological injustice under racial capitalism. I argue that urban climate resilience policies across Amsterdam and Dhaka renegotiate and reconfigure techniques, practices and ideologies of racial and class-based inequality in response to threats and insecurity posed by climate change within and across urban scales. Looking across Amsterdam and Dhaka, I demonstrate that climate resilience policies primarily aim to protect status quo forms of capital accumulation at the urban scale rather than enact comprehensive climate adaptation measures. As a result, the ineffective and inequitable nature of resilience continues to support highly racially uneven urban socio-natures across the global North and global South, enabled by racist imaginaries where communities in the global South - particularly the urban poor - are framed as being undeserving of environmental justice.

While most research in the last decade has focused on understanding the dynamics and impacts of future coastal flooding from extreme sea levels, the effects of relative sea level rise (RSLR) on exacerbating tsunami hazards are not well understood. Far-field or distant sourced tsunamis tend to have relatively lower impacts in Pacific Island states compared with locally sourced events, but there is limited understanding of how the impact of far-field tsunamis changes over time due to RSLR. Using the hydrodynamics software BG-Flood, we modelled the Tohoku-oki tsunami from propagation to inundation in Samoa under incremental SLR to examine the effects that RSLR has on changing the exposure of the built environment (e.g., buildings) to a far-field tsunami. Outputs of maximum tsunami inundation and flow depth intensities which incorporate incremental SLR were then combined with digital representations of buildings and depth-damage functions in the RiskScape multi-hazard risk modelling software to assess the changes in building exposure over time. Results suggest that the impacts of Tohoku-oki-type far-field tsunamis become significant once RSLR reaches 1 m above present levels. Present-day building exposure will increase by approx. 500% with 1 m RSLR by 2080-2130, and approx. 2350% with 2 m RSLR by as early as 2130-2140. These findings provide useful insights for application to tsunami hazard risk assessments under changing sea level conditions in analogous island environments.

In developing countries, SMEs tend to exhibit low adaptive capacities, influenced by their enabling environments. A holistic understanding of how their capacity to adapt is influenced by both the qualities of their enabling environments and their inherent characteristics is needed. This study contributes to this understanding by reviewing the current knowledge of adaptive capacity in SMEs and providing an analysis of the environment for enabling SMEs to adapt to flood risk in Sri Lanka. Data originates from the Building Businesses' Climate Resilience project, implemented in Sri Lanka between 2018 and 2021. The study finds that deficiencies in Sri Lanka's enabling environment mean SMEs are unable to attain the information and competencies that would allow them to adopt suitable adaptation strategies for managing flood risk. Simultaneously, the results show that their capacity to cope with the impacts of flood events is not adequately enhanced by the financial services and support available prior to, and in the aftermath of, extreme weather events. Accordingly, it is suggested that the national government play a greater role in enhancing the enabling environment for adaptation. With the support of other prominent actors in Sri Lanka's enabling environment, they should seek to enhance access to post-disaster finance, the availability of affordable insurance products for uninsured SMEs, and the availability of interventions and resources that fill the information and capacity gaps that SMEs possess.

In the last 20 years, the expansion of urban and industrial areas has added to this degradation. The growing interest in nature-based solutions, including water-retention measures, is a response to reversing landscape degradation, rejuvenating ecosystem services, and mitigating the impacts of large-scale commercial agriculture and climate change. In this study, the costs and benefits of water-retention measures in eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are assessed. Results indicate that water-retention measures offer increased water availability over all land use classes assessed, help increase crop productivity, and aid in landscape cooling. Croplands are suggested as being the best value for money, offering the greatest volume potentials (mean = 88 million m(3)), cooling effects (mean = -1.6 degrees C), and productivity gains (mean = euro66 million yr(-1)), while also being the cheapest to implement per unit area. Differing policies in the three states will likely result in non-uniform selection or implementation of measures. Future work should focus on local-level studies offering greater practical messages beyond the regional-level analysis conducted here. This work contributes to the growing body of literature assessing the costs and benefits of water-retention measures, including the potential for landscape cooling, lowering temperature gradients, and ecosystem restoration. As the world urbanises, and as more land is converted to homogeneous cropland, such measures may prove critical in mitigating climate change, landscape drying, flood runoff, and soil and nutrient loss.

Exploring the different design schemes of rainwater in situ regulation and storage systems in green spaces to cope with extreme rainfall events is critical to cities for combating flood disasters. Using the Gongkang green space as the research object and the XPDrainage software program as the simulation tool, this study explored and evaluated different design schemes of rainwater in situ regulation and storage systems in green spaces and their responses to extreme rainfall events in Shanghai. Based on the simulated results of the runoff curves, paths and ponding area of the Gongkang green space, the ideal number and position of rainwater regulation and storage facilities were determined. Four different schemes were examined: Scheme A (diversion-oriented), Scheme B (infiltration- and detention-oriented) and schemes C and D (comprehensive rainwater regulation and storage systems). From the simulation evaluation, the total runoff volume capture rate of Scheme C reached 100%, 99.8% and 98.2% under one-, three- and five-year return period rainfall events, respectively. For the 210 mm extraordinary rainstorm event, Scheme C's and Scheme D's total runoff volume capture rates reached 81.9% and 94.7%, respectively. Therefore, the comprehensive rainwater regulation and storage schemes (schemes C and D) met the runoff control requirements under extreme rainfall events in the Gongkang green space. This study provides a technical reference for the optimal design of a rainwater in situ regulation and storage system in a green space and promotes the construction of resilient cities.

Freshwater availability in Africa has now become of major concern under the combined effect of climate change, environmental alterations and anthropogenic pressure. However, the hydrology of the African river basins remains one of the least studied worldwide and a better monitoring and understanding of the hydrological processes across the continent become fundamental. Earth Observation, that offers a cost-effective means for monitoring the terrestrial water cycle, plays a major role in supporting surface hydrology investigations. Remote sensing advances are therefore a game changer to develop comprehensive observing systems to monitor Africa's land water and manage its water resources. Here, we review the achievements of more than three decades of advances using remote sensing to study surface waters in Africa, highlighting the current benefits and difficulties. We show how the availability of a large number of sensors and observations, coupled with models, offers new possibilities to monitor a continent with scarce gauged stations. In the context of upcoming satellite missions dedicated to surface hydrology, such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), we discuss future opportunities and how the use of remote sensing could benefit scientific and societal applications, such as water resource management, flood risk prevention and environment monitoring under current global change.

Assessing the coastal protection services of natural mangrove forests and artificial rock revetments	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Avicennia marina; Coastal infrastructure; Coastal Protection; Eco-engineering; Social science; Economic valuation	INFRASTRUCTURE; RISK; ATTENUATION; PERCEPTION; HABITATS; DEFENSE; LINKING	Coastal flooding and erosion cause significant social and economic impacts, globally. There is a growing interest in using natural habitats such as mangroves to defend coastlines. The protective services of mangroves, however, have not been assessed in the same rigorous engineering and socio-economic terms as rock revetments, and therefore are often overlooked by coastal managers. We used field measurements, a social science survey and economic valuation to compare the coastal protection services of mangroves and rock revetments, at five locations across Victoria, Australia. The results showed, in sheltered locations, both mangroves and rock revetments attenuated waves, however, the wave attenuation (per metre) of rock revetments was greater than mangroves, at two of the five locations. Only a small proportion of the survey respondents had observed flooding or erosion in their suburb but most agreed that mangroves provide important coastal protection benefits. Coastal landowners visited areas with mangroves more often than the public but were less likely to worry about the links between climate change and coastal erosion and flooding, or to agree that the coast was well protected with existing artificial coastal infrastructure, than other respondents. There were much higher up-front costs associated with building rock revetments, than planting mangroves, but rock revetments required less land than mangroves. Mangroves covered a larger area and averted more damages than rock revetments. Coastal managers and policy makers will have more success in advocating for nature-based solutions for coastal protection, if they are implemented in locations where they are eco-engineering and socio-economically acceptable options for climate change adaptation.

Modelling Impacts of Environmental Water on Vegetation of a Semi-Arid Floodplain-Lakes System Using 30-Year Landsat Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						environmental water; vegetation; normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI); generalized additive mixed model (GAMM); Hattah Lakes; climate change	RIVER; FLOW; INUNDATION; CLIMATE; MURRAY; INDEX; CONNECTIVITY; CHALLENGES; GREENNESS; RESPONSES	River floodplains are among the most dynamic and diverse ecosystems on the planet. They are at risk of degradation due to river regulation and climate change. Environmental water has been delivered to floodplains to maintain environmental health by mimicking natural floods. It is important to understand the long-term effects of environmental water to floodplain vegetation to support its management. This study used Normalized Differences Vegetation index (NDVI) from the 30-year Landsat datasets of the Hattah Lakes floodplain in Australia to investigate the drivers of vegetation dynamics. We developed generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) to model responses of vegetation to environmental water, natural floods, precipitation, temperature, and distance to water across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We found the effect of environmental water on floodplain vegetation to be quite different from that of natural floods in both space and time. Vegetation in most areas of Hattah Lakes will respond to natural floods within one month of flooding, while positive responses to environmental water occur 1 to 3 months after inundation and are more restricted spatially. For environmental water planning, managers need to be aware of these differences. The implementation of new infrastructure to transport or retain environmental water on floodplains needs to be planned carefully, with continuous monitoring of rainfall and natural floods. Whilst environmental floods do not mimic the effect of natural floods, they do provide some positive benefits that can partially offset effects of reduced natural floods.

Examination of measures to adapt to the damage represents an urgent matter for agriculture. A multidisciplinary research project aimed at providing effective information related to development a weather index insurance (WII) system was conducted for rice farmers in a coastal region of Myanmar to achieve sustainable rice farm management in the country, which is among the world's poorest and most disaster prone. For lower income countries, WII is one adaptation measure to mitigate damage by climate change. Using remote sensing and statistical data, changes in tracks of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, the duration of damage by cyclone disasters, and areas affected by saltwater intrusion were analyzed to ascertain risk levels for disasters in the target area: Labutta township in the Ayeyarwady region. Furthermore, demand analysis of WII using discrete choice experiments, a question-based statistical survey method, revealed that farmers' demand of WIIs for cyclone landfall, flood, and drought is relatively greater than that for saltwater intrusion. This finding indicates that saltwater intrusion might not be a crucially important matter for farmers who cultivate rainfed rice, whereas inland water floods caused by cyclone landfall and drought caused for changing the weather patterns represent a threat for these farmers. Results of econometric model analysis for designing a WII indicate that if a regular farmer in the township were to pay 41.5 US dollars per year to purchase WII for flood damage, their expected income will be stable.

Streamflow was simulated from two CORDEX-Africa regional climate models (RCMs) forced by the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs), namely, the CanESM2m and IPSL-CM5A-MR climate models. Three climate projection time intervals were considered spanning from 2006 to 2099 and delineated as follows: current climatology (2006-2035), near future (2036-2065) and end of century future projection (2070-2099). Statistical metrics derived from the projected streamflow were used to assess the impacts of the changing climate on water-linked sectors. These metrics included streamflow trends, low and high flow quantile probabilities, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) trends and the proportion (%) of dry and wet years, as well as drought monitoring indicators. Based on the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, the LRB is projected to experience reduced streamflow in both the near and the distant future. The basin is projected to experience frequent dry and wet conditions that can translate to drought and flash floods, respectively. In particular, a high proportion of dry and a few incidences of wet years are expected in the basin in the future. In general, the findings of this research study will inform and enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation policy decisions and implementation thereof, to sustain the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.

Eugene			An Integrated Approach for Assessing the Impact of Large-Scale Future Floods on a Highway Transport System	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Flood; highway network; impact assessment; multi-agent modeling; traffic simulation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; ROAD NETWORK; RISK; PRECIPITATION; FLOW; VULNERABILITY; TEMPERATURE; CONSISTENT; SCENARIOS	The negative impact of climate change continues to escalate flood risk. Floods directly and indirectly damage highway systems and disturb the socioeconomic order. In this study, we propose an integrated approach to quantitatively assess how floods impact the functioning of a highway system. The approach has three parts: (1) a multi-agent simulation model to represent traffic, heterogeneous user demand, and route choice in a highway network; (2) a flood simulator using future runoff scenarios generated from five global climate models, three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and the CaMa-Flood model; and (3) an impact analyzer, which superimposes the simulated floods on the highway traffic simulation system, and quantifies the flood impact on a highway system based on car following model. This approach is illustrated with a case study of the Chinese highway network. The results show that (i) for different global climate models, the associated flood damage to a highway system is not linearly correlated with the forcing levels of RCPs, or with future years; (ii) floods in different years have variable impacts on regional connectivity; and (iii) extreme flood impacts can cause huge damages in highway networks; that is, in 2030, the estimated 84.5% of routes between provinces cannot be completed when the highway system is disturbed by a future major flood. These results have critical implications for transport sector policies and can be used to guide highway design and infrastructure protection. The approach can be extended to analyze other networks with spatial vulnerability, and it is an effective quantitative tool for reducing systemic disaster risk.

Understanding of local disaster risks and knowledge of underlying causes for negative impacts of disasters are critical factors to working toward a resilient environment across the social, economic, and the built sectors. Historically, floods have caused more economical and social damage around the world than other types of natural hazards. Since the 1900s, the most frequent hazards in Canada have been floods, wildfire, drought, and extreme cold, in terms of economic damage. The recent flood events in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba have raised compelling concerns. These include should communities be educated with useful knowledge on hazard risk and resilience so they would be interested in the discussion on the vital role they can play in building resilience in their communities. Increasing awareness that perceived risk can be very different from the real threat is the motivation behind this study. The main objectives of this study include identifying and quantifying the gap between people's perception of exposure and susceptibility to the risk and a lack of coping capacity and objective assessment of risk and resilience, as well as estimating an integrated measure of disaster resilience in a community. The proposed method has been applied to floods as an example, using actual data on the geomorphology of the study area, including terrain and low lying regions. It is hoped that the study will encourage a broader debate if a unified strategy for disaster resilience would be feasible and beneficial in Canada.

The areal extent of lake boundary extracted through LDA and areal extent of manually interpreted lake boundary exhibit a remarkable agreement (R-2-0.99). Glacial lake dynamics is assessed in terms of areal and volumetric expansion for two selected glacial lakes from 1979 to 2017, i.e. Samudra Tapu (0.95 km(2)), and Gepang Gath (0.67 km(2)). They show volumetric expansion from 8.52 x 10(6) m(3) (1979) to 80.34 x 10(6) m(3) (2017) and 2.04 x 10(6) m(3) (1979) to 32.44 x 10(6) m(3) (2017) respectively. Statistical analysis (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope) of climate data indicates rise in mean annual temperature (0.021 degrees C yr(-1); 1961-2015) and fall in annual precipitation (-2.74 mm yr(-1); 1951-2015) at different confidence intervals. Further Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) is modelled using empirical relationship and Simplified Dam Breach Model (SMPDBK). The SMPDBK demonstrates discharge of 3866.52 and 2100.90 m(3) s(-1) reaching Chhatru and Sissu village posing threat to life and property. The study also exhibits that glacial shrinkage under the influence of climate change causes expansion of glacial lakes. This expansion is expected to intensify catastrophic GLOF and resultant fatalities and destruction in the downstream region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In contrast to teleconnections, which are typically defined based on the characteristic spatial variations of a meteorological field or on the remote circulation response to a known forcing, LSMPs are defined relative to the occurrence of a specific phenomenon-here, extreme precipitation-and with an emphasis on the synoptic scales that have a primary influence in individual events, have medium-range weather predictability, and are well-resolved in both weather and climate models. For the LSMP relationship with extreme precipitation, we consider the previous literature with respect to definitions and data, dynamical mechanisms, model representation, and climate change trends. There is considerable uncertainty in identifying extremes based on existing observational precipitation data and some limitations in analyzing the associated LSMPs in reanalysis data. Many different definitions of "extreme" are in use, making it difficult to directly compare different studies. Dynamically, several types of meteorological systems-extratropical cyclones, tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective systems, and mesohighs-and several mechanisms-fronts, atmospheric rivers, and orographic ascent-have been shown to be important aspects of extreme precipitation LSMPs. The extreme precipitation is often realized through mesoscale processes organized, enhanced, or triggered by the LSMP. Understanding of model representation, trends, and projections for LSMPs is at an early stage, although some promising analysis techniques have been identified and the LSMP perspective is useful for evaluating the model dynamics associated with extremes.

Social media usage patterns during natural hazards	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TWITTER; INFLUENTIALS; DISASTER	Natural hazards are becoming increasingly expensive as climate change and development are exposing communities to greater risks. Preparation and recovery are critical for climate change resilience, and social media are being used more and more to communicate before, during, and after disasters. While there is a growing body of research aimed at understanding how people use social media surrounding disaster events, most existing work has focused on a single disaster case study. In the present study, we analyze five of the costliest disasters in the last decade in the United States (Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, two sets of tornado outbreaks, and flooding in Louisiana) through the lens of Twitter. In particular, we explore the frequency of both generic and specific food-security related terms, and quantify the relationship between network size and Twitter activity during disasters. We find differences in tweet volume for keywords depending on disaster type, with people using Twitter more frequently in preparation for Hurricanes, and for real-time or recovery information for tornado and flooding events. Further, we find that people share a host of general disaster and specific preparation and recovery terms during these events. Finally, we find that among all account types, individuals with "average" sized networks are most likely to share information during these disasters, and in most cases, do so more frequently than normal. This suggests that around disasters, an ideal form of social contagion is being engaged in which average people rather than outsized influentials are key to communication. These results provide important context for the type of disaster information and target audiences that may be most useful for disaster communication during varying extreme events.

The second factor is possible climate change. These changes can negatively (or positively) affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. To reduce the impact on the environment, it is necessary to determine the nature and indicators of changes in the hydrological regime, calculate quantitative estimates of these indicators and ranges of acceptable values, and develop release rules that ensure compliance with these ranges with a given probability. To manage the water resources of the Volga and Kama Rivers, the main ecological task is to flood the floodplain meadows, to maintain the conditions of natural reproduction of fish on the Lower Volga, including the Volga River delta and the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain. In addition, it is necessary to meet with sufficient reliability the requirements of energy in the summer-autumn and winter low-water periods and water transport during the navigation period. The task of optimal management is to find such solutions in years of different water content that ensure the well-being of the main water users with a given probability and do not disturb the Lower Volga ecosystem. This article presents the research of the water resources state of the water resource system of the Volga and Kama river basins. A statistical analysis of the hydrological series of the observed inflow for 1916-2020 was performed, and the inflow change point (1979) was found by the Bayesian method of estimation. A statistically significant difference between the average inflow values of two series (1916-1978, 1979-2020) was proved using a two-sample Student's test. The seasonal parameters of the reliability curves were calculated based on the three-parameter Kritsky and Menkel distribution. For these two series, water resource optimization calculations (using Excel Solver) were performed, and the reliability of fulfilling the requirements of water users was determined; for the series 1916-1978, an alternative solution was found in favor of fisheries, and an analysis of the results was also performed. The methodology used in the research allows finding trade-off solutions in the favor of different water users (ecology, agriculture and fisheries, water supply, hydropower, navigation, etc.) and is based on the use of multi-criteria optimization methods and the trade-offs theory. As a result of the research, new knowledge was obtained about the hydrological situation in the basin of the Volga-Kama reservoir cascade in connection with climate change.

This article describes the application of a performance assessment framework for storm water systems, in collaboration with two Portuguese urban water utilities. A performance assessment system was built for each water utility, including objectives, assessment criteria and performance metrics. The results showed the existence of areas vulnerable to flooding occurrences and the need for investment in rehabilitation. The application of the performance assessment framework supports the identification of systems' vulnerabilities and priorities for intervention. Opportunities and suggestions for improving data collection procedures are identified.

RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian learning; flood risk; insurance; overoptimism	PROSPECT-THEORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVENT EVIDENCE; OVERCONFIDENCE; HURRICANES; HOUSEHOLDS	In the presence of rare disasters, risk perceptions may not always align with actual risks. These perceptions can nevertheless influence an individual's willingness to mitigate risks through activities such as purchasing flood insurance. In a survey of Maryland floodplain residents, we find that stated risk perceptions predict voluntary flood insurance take-up, while perceptions themselves varied widely among surveyed residents, owing in large part to differences in past flood experience. We use a formal test for overoptimism in risk perceptions and find that, on aggregate, floodplain residents are overly optimistic about flood risks.

It experienced increasing trends over 1979-1996 and decreasing trends over 1996-2022, which are not yet well understood. Here we show observational and numerical evidence that stratospheric ozone has significant impacts on long-term trends of summer precipitation in this strong convection area. It is found that stratospheric ozone depletion, by modulating the lower stratospheric temperature and upper-tropospheric static stability, enhances deep convection and precipitation over the southern slope of the Tibetan Plateau. The results suggest that the ozone recovery in the future may reduce the summer precipitation over the southern slope of the Tibetan Plateau in the first half of the 21st century, which would be imperative for future water resource management in South Asia.

J	Boumis, G; Moftakhari, HR; Moradkhani, H				Boumis, Georgios; Moftakhari, Hamed. R. R.; Moradkhani, Hamid			Coevolution of Extreme Sea Levels and Sea-Level Rise Under Global Warming	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						extreme sea levels; sea-level rise; non-stationary frequency analysis; coastal flooding; climate change	UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; CLIMATE; FRAMEWORK; TESTS	Design of coastal defense structures like seawalls and breakwaters can no longer be based on stationarity assumption. In many parts of the world, an anticipated sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change will constitute present-day extreme sea levels inappropriate for future coastal flood risk assessments since it will significantly increase their probability of occurrence. Here, we first show that global annual maxima sea levels (AMSLs) have been increasing in magnitude over the last decades, primarily due to a positive shift in mean sea level (MSL). Then, we apply non-stationary extreme value theory to model the extremal behavior of sea levels with MSL as a covariate and quantify the evolution of AMSLs in the following decades using revised probabilistic sea-level rise projections. Our analysis reveals that non-stationary distributions exhibit distinct differences compared to simply considering stationary conditions with a change in location parameter equal to the amount of MSL rise. With the use of non-stationary distributions, we show that by the year 2050 many locations will experience their present-day 100-yr return level as an event with return period less than 15 and 9 years under the moderate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) representative concentration pathways. Also, we find that by the end of this century almost all locations examined will encounter their current 100-yr return level on an annual basis, even if CO2 concentration is kept at moderate levels (RCP4.5). Our assessment accounts for large uncertainty by incorporating ambiguities in both SLR projections and non-stationary extreme value distribution parameters via a Monte Carlo simulation.Plain Language Summary The gradual increase of global mean sea level (MSL), known as sea-level rise (SLR), is one of the biggest climate change-related concerns of the 21st century. SLR poses a threat to seaside communities and can lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of coastal flooding. Thus, evaluating the future expected number of extreme sea-level events and their magnitudes is critical for sustainable coastal flood risk management. In this work, we show significant increasing trends in extreme sea levels at a "pseudo-global" scale, cross-examined by different trend detection methods. Hence, we model coming coastal flood hazard with the assumption that MSL will continue to rise in the future. This is the first global-scale study that utilizes a physical covariate, that is, MSL for explicit statistical modeling of the evolving coastal flood hazard. By using revised SLR projections that account for uncertainty, we show a substantial increase in coastal flood hazard by end of the century, either under a moderate or a high CO2 concentration pathway.

Cooling Effects Revealed by Modeling of Wetlands and Land-Atmosphere Interactions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SURFACE-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; HYDROLOGY; BALANCE; PARAMETERIZATION; CONVECTION; REGIME; LAKES; AREA	Wetlands are important ecosystems-they provide vital hydrological and ecological services such as regulating floods, storing carbon, and providing wildlife habitat. The ability to simulate their spatial extents and hydrological processes is important for valuing wetlands' function. The purpose of this study is to dynamically represent the spatial extents and hydrological processes of wetlands and investigate their feedback to regional climate in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America, where a large number of wetlands exist. In this study, we incorporated a wetland scheme into the Noah-MP land surface model with two major modifications: (a) modifying the subgrid saturation fraction for spatial wetland extent and (b) incorporating a dynamic wetland storage to simulate hydrological processes. This scheme was evaluated at a fen site in central Saskatchewan, Canada and applied regionally in the PPR with 13-year climate forcing produced by a high-resolution convection-permitting model. The differences between wetland and no-wetland simulations are significant, with increasing latent heat and evapotranspiration while suppressing sensible heat and runoff in the wetland scheme. Finally, the dynamic wetland scheme was applied in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The wetlands scheme not only modifies the surface energy balance but also interacts with the lower atmosphere, shallowing the planetary boundary layer height and promoting cloud formation. A cooling effect of 1-3 degrees C in summer temperature is evident where wetlands are abundant. In particular, the wetland simulation shows reduction in the number of hot days for >10 days over the summer of 2006, when a long-lasting heatwave occurred. This research has great implications for land surface/regional climate modeling and wetland conservation, especially in mitigating extreme heatwaves under climate change. Plain Language Summary A large number of wetlands exist in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) across the US and Canada. These wetlands are important to our environment as they can provide flood control and wildlife habitat and may cool the temperature, but they are poorly represented in previous land surface model (LSM) studies. In this study, we updated a dynamic wetland module in the Noah-MP LSM to reasonably estimate wetland extent and seasonal variation in the PPR. This wetland module shows significant impacts to the surface environmental conditions and interactions with regional climate. The results show that wetlands would effectively cool the air temperature 1-3 degrees C in summer, especially for regions with high wetland coverage. The implication of this study is very useful for wetland conservation agencies and climate scientists, as this cooling effect could potentially mitigate heat stress under climate change.

Coastal community's perceptions on the role of seagrass ecosystems for coastal protection and implications for management	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Seagrass ecosystem services; Coastal erosion; Coastal communities; Perceptions; Ecosystem-based adaptations; Livelihoods	EXPOSED SANDY BEACHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESTORATION; ZONE; CONSERVATION; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; ENERGY; LINKS	Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services to coastal communities, which include ecosystem-based adaptations for coastal protection; however, globally seagrasses are among the least conserved marine ecosystems. In order to develop and provide accurate and efficient decision-making processes and conservation actions, an understanding of the importance of ecosystem services for people's livelihoods and wellbeing is key. Using social research methods, such as Nominal Group Technique, Key Informant Interviews and household surveys, this study explored the association between seagrass ecosystem services and the perceptions of coastal communities on socio-ecological values including ecosystem-based adaptations in Maputo and Inhambane Bays, Mozambique. Fishermen identified support to fisheries production as crucial services provided by seagrasses to coastal communities. Respondents (93%) perceived that coastal erosion is occurring in the region and that it has accelerated in the last 20 years due to more frequent floods following cyclones. In addition, coastal development (34.9%) together with destructive fishing practices (31.3%) were stated as the main anthropogenic causes of coastal erosion as seagrasses diminish. The coastal communities (76.3%) proposed marine ecosystem restoration as the first measure to prevent coastal erosion. The coastal respondents also identified seagrass regulatory ecosystem services being central for their social and economic wellbeing and demonstrated (92%) a desire to participate in seagrass restoration in their region. This study found a high level of awareness by local communities concerning the values and socio-ecological function of seagrass meadows. This provides a strong foundation to develop effective conservation and management measures in order to ensure sustainable solutions to build resilience and stronger ecosystem-based adaptations against climate change.

While multihazard assessments of these extreme weather events enhance the estimation of hazard susceptibility, it must be coupled with identifying institutional barriers of managing the land-river interface. Thus, this study has carried out a multihazard susceptibility assessment based on landslide and flood susceptibility in the Sutlej-Beas River basin and prepared flood and landslide susceptibility maps using eleven causative parameters through a bivariate statistical frequency ratio (FR) model. This statistical evaluation of hazard susceptibility from multiple factors is supplemented by identifying the key barriers of managing the land-river interface, producing a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges of mitigating extreme weather-related hazards in a river basin. Nearly 51% of the study area was identified as susceptible to landslide while 43% was under flood and 48% area was observed under multihazard susceptibility. Landslides, floods, and multihazard followed a similar pattern of spatial distribution where elevation, population, drainage density, stream power index (SPI), and rainfall were identified as the contributing parameters. Changing attitudes of people toward rivers, lack of coordination among different stakeholders, and deficit funds were identified as prominent barriers in the case of land-river management. Susceptibility maps generated in this study will help in identifying the areas under hazard susceptibility while the identified institutional barriers may guide towards contextual sustainable planning of the basin and attainment of sustainable development goals.

To meet the increasing water demand and to prepare for the exacerbating climate change-fueled droughts, the South Korean government added a water supply function to the Hwacheon reservoir, built initially as a hydropower reservoir. However, it is missing the reservoir rule curve for water supply. The main objective is to develop a rule curve that maximizes water supply reliability and the operating objective of the Hwacheon reservoir. We develop the rule curve with a well-known optimization technique (Genetic Algorithms (GA)) and new optimization techniques (Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO)). The novelty of this study is developing the most appropriate rule curve for hydropower reservoir with add-on water supply function. We evaluate and compare the performance of the developed rule curve to the firm supply method (FSM). We use the discrete hedging rule to build rule curve that provides a scheduled and rationing supply. The performance indices are time-based reliability, volumetric reliability, and the number of months when the reservoir storage is in each storage stage. Results showed that obtained rule curve with GA, GWO, and IGWO algorithms performed better than FSM. IGWO algorithm outperformed GA and GWO algorithms. We concluded that IGWO algorithm was an effective and powerful tool for developing reservoir rule curve. This research is a fundamental study demonstrating the effectiveness of IGWO algorithm as a promising alternative optimization algorithm for complex reservoir operation problems.

In this study, the runoff in the Yellow River source area was divided into two intra-annual time scales: flood season, non-flood season and spring, summer, autumn and winter, and the sensitivity and attribution differences of runoff changes in the Yellow River source area at different intra-annual time scales were quantitatively assessed based on the time-varying Budyko framework. Results show that the runoff in the Yellow River source area decreases during the flood season and spring, summer and autumn, and increases during the non-flood season and winter from 1960 to 2020, with an insignificant decreasing trend in annual runoff. Flood season and autumn runoff changes are the main reasons for the reduction in annual runoff. Runoff in the Yellow River source area is most sensitive to the underlying surface such as vegetation and soil freeze-thaw change, and in terms of climate change, non-flood season and autumn runoff is more sensitive to changes in precipitation, while flood season and summer runoff is more sensitive to changes in potential evaporation. The underlying surface change is the dominant factor for annual runoff change. And for the intraannual runoff change, the non-flood season, spring and winter runoff in the Yellow River source area is dominated by the underlying surface change, and flood season, summer and autumn runoff is dominated by the climate change. These findings can provide theoretical support for the scientific response to environmental change and the enhancement of water conservation capacity in the Yellow River source area.

A Markov Decision Process Approach for Cost-Benefit Analysis of Infrastructure Resilience Upgrades	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Cost-benefit analysis; disasters; infrastructure hardening; Markov decision process; resilience	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODELS; SANDY	As climate change threatens to cause increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, decisionmakers must consider costly investments to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructures. Evaluating these potential resilience improvements using traditional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approaches is often problematic because disasters are stochastic and can destroy even hardened infrastructure, meaning that the lifetimes of investments are themselves uncertain. In this article, we develop a novel Markov decision process (MDP) model for CBA of infrastructure resilience upgrades that offer prevention (reduce the probability of a disaster) and/or protection (mitigate the cost of a disaster) benefits. Stochastic features of the model include disaster occurrences and whether or not a disaster terminates the effective life of an earlier resilience upgrade. From our MDP model, we derive analytical expressions for the decisionmaker's willingness to pay (WTP) to enhance infrastructure resilience, and conduct a comparative static analysis to investigate how the WTP varies with the fundamental parameters of the problem. Following this theoretical portion of the article, we demonstrate the applicability of our MDP framework to real-world decision making by applying it to two case studies of electric utility infrastructure hardening. The first case study considers elevating a flood-prone substation and the second assesses upgrading transmission structures to withstand high winds. Results from these two case studies show that assumptions about the value of lost load during power outages and the distribution of customer types significantly influence the WTP for the resilience upgrades and are material to the decisions of whether or not to implement them.

Predicting sea level near the coasts, with a high accuracy and in a reasonable amount of time, becomes a strategic task. Despite the developments of complex numerical codes for high-resolution ocean modeling, the task of making forecasts in areas at the intersection between land and sea remains challenging. In this respect, the use of machine learning techniques can represent an interesting alternative to be investigated and evaluated by numerical modelers. This article presents the application of the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to the problem of short-term sea level forecasting in the Southern Adriatic Northern Ionian (SANI) domain in the Mediterranean sea. The proposed multi-model architecture based on LSTM networks has been trained to predict mean sea levels three days ahead, for different coastal locations. Predictions were compared with the observation data collected through the tide-gauge devices as well as with the forecasts produced by the Southern Adriatic Northern Ionian Forecasting System (SANIFS) developed at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), which provides short-term daily updated forecasts in the Mediterranean basin.

Rice paddies have been a major concern to scientific community, because they produce the threatening and long-lasting GHGs mainly CH4 and N2O. Around 30% and 11% of global agricultural CH4 and N2O, respectively, emitted from rice fields. Thus, it is urgent to concurrently quantify the fluxes of CH4 and N2O to improve understanding of both the gases from rice fields and to develop mitigation strategies for upcoming climate change reduction. An effort is being made in this review to discuss exclusively the emission of CH4 and N2O under normal and controlled conditions in different locations of India and also addresses the current synthesis of available data on how field and crop management activities influence CH4 and N2O emissions in rice fields. Making changes to conventional crop management regimes could have a significant impact on reducing GHG emissions from rice field. Environmental and agricultural factors related to soil could be easily altered by management practices. So, knowing the mechanism of CH4 and N2O production and release in the rice field and factors controlling the emissions is fundamental to develop well-organized strategies to reduce emissions from rice cultivated soil. This will help the regulatory bodies or policy makers to formulate adequate policies for agricultural farmers to refine the GHG emissions as well as minimize the global climate change.

The exposed highenergy South African coastline restricts mangroves to 32 sheltered estuaries of which 18 (56%) are predominantly open to the sea. A large area of mangrove (47% of the country total) occurs in the uMhlathuze Estuary - a novel ecosystem formed by the creation of an artificial mouth. A Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) framework was applied to understand factors of change and highlight governance and management responses. The largest mangrove area (440 ha) was lost during the construction of Durban Bay harbour. Mangroves (similar to 7 ha) no longer occur in 10 small KwaZulu-Natal estuaries as a result of catchment and mouth disturbance. In the Eastern Cape, pressures are escalating in the form of harvesting for wood, cattle browsing and changes in mouth condition. Climate related warming and an increase in CO2 are positive conditions for mangroves to expand their distribution to higher latitudes but this will depend on propagule dispersal between estuaries and the availability of suitable habitats. Many of the small estuaries are temporarily closed to the sea for different periods thus limiting recruitment. An increase in the intensity of freshwater floods will scour banks and completely remove mangroves. It is important that these dynamic responses are understood and incorporated into management plans so that mangrove forests can be better protected and conserved.

An integrated 1D-2D hydraulic modelling approach to assess the sensitivity of a coastal region to compound flooding hazard under climate change	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Biennial International Conference on Advances in Extreme Value Analysis and Application to Natural Hazards (EVAN)	SEP 12-14, 2017	Southampton, ENGLAND			Flooding; Hydraulic modelling; Storm surge; Sea-level rise; Compound hazard; Extreme value analysis	STORM-SURGE; RISK; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; DEPENDENCE; RIVER; FLOW	Coastal regions are dynamic areas that often lie at the junction of different natural hazards. Extreme events such as storm surges and high precipitation are significant sources of concern for flood management. As climatic changes and sea-level rise put further pressure on these vulnerable systems, there is a need for a better understanding of the implications of compounding hazards. Recent computational advances in hydraulic modelling offer new opportunities to support decision-making and adaptation. Our research makes use of recently released features in the HEC-RAS version 5.0 software to develop an integrated 1D-2D hydrodynamic model. Using extreme value analysis with the Peaks-Over-Threshold method to define extreme scenarios, the model was applied to the eastern coast of the UK. The sensitivity of the protected wetland known as the Broads to a combination of fluvial, tidal and coastal sources of flooding was assessed, accounting for different rates of twenty-first century sea-level rise up to the year 2100. The 1D-2D approach led to a more detailed representation of inundation in coastal urban areas, while allowing for interactions with more fluvially dominated inland areas to be captured. While flooding was primarily driven by increased sea levels, combined events exacerbated flooded area by 5-40% and average depth by 10-32%, affecting different locations depending on the scenario. The results emphasise the importance of catchment-scale strategies that account for potentially interacting sources of flooding.

Assessing agricultural drought and flood risks is of great significance in formulating disaster prevention and increasing farmer's income. In this paper, the new method combining multi-index comprehensive evaluation with entropy information diffusion model is used to assess the risk of agricultural drought and flood disasters in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and relevant policy recommendations are proposed based on the assessment results. The method considers the effects of natural, economic and social factors on disasters while solving the problem of insufficient information and visualizing disaster risk in the region. The assessment results show that, first of all, the research area is threatened by agricultural drought and flood, and the threat of flooding is greater than the threat of drought. Second, with the change of disaster intensity, the risk characteristics of drought and flood disasters are different. Third, the cities in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are more vulnerable to disasters than the cities in the lower reaches, and the drought in the study area has become an agricultural threat that cannot be ignored. Based on the model of solving the problem of insufficient information and the consideration of comprehensive disaster factors, the assessment of disaster risk can more intuitively and comprehensively reflect the laws and characteristics of disasters, and is of great significance for the implementation of disaster prevention and mitigation in the region.

However, the consequence of climate change on WC services is largely unknown, particularly in mountain areas with limited data availability. By using a parametric model driven by ground and satellite remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of WC and its inter-annual trends and variability were assessed in the Qilian Mountains to differentiate the main factors for WC dynamics. Our results showed that the spatiotemporal variation of modeled WC and remotely sensed soil moisture was consistent. Mean annual WC showed a contrary trend with increasing annual mean air temperature and precipitation and was higher in forests than grasslands and deserts. In the context of warm and humid climates, percentage of the area with a significant increase and decrease in annual WC from 2000 to 2019 was 32.2% and 4.2% (p < 0.05), respectively. WC declines appeared mainly in a forest steppe zone at an altitude of 2600-3300 m, as increased vegetation growth boosted water consumption and eventually led to soil drying. Increases in WC were largely attributed to increasing precipitation and decreasing solar radiation, making a contribution of 39.4 and 38.4%, respectively. WC was positively correlated with precipitation but negatively related to land surface temperature (p < 0.05). A negative relationship between WC and solar radiation was prevalent in deserts. Precipitation and vegetation growth explained 50.1% and 22.8%, respectively, of the inter-annual variability in WC. The findings of this study highlight the importance of evapotranspiration in controlling WC dynamics in the forest steppe zone of a dryland mountain, where a risk from reduced water conservation may increase under future climate warming. To conserve grassland and desert ecosystems is more beneficial to improve the WC function of the Qilian Mountains as compared to afforestation.

The objective of this study is to apply further existing and develop new methodological frameworks to quantitatively assess and map the current and future supply of 3 ES in the coastal zone of Lithuania: coastal flood protection, nutrient regulation, and maintenance of nurse!) , conditions. For coastal flood ES modelling, 2 time periods (1990 and 2018) and 4 scenarios (A0, A1 A2, A3 - based on future socio-economic changes in Lithuania) were analysed. The coastal flood protection ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.30) using tree cover density. The results showed spatial differences among the analysed periods but no statistical differences. High supply areas are located in the southern coastal area, while the central part displays a low supply. For nutrient regulation and maintenance of nursery conditions, 7 time periods were analysed: a historical period and 6 scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 and 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The nutrient regulation ES model was validated (r(2) = 0.85) using in situ nutrient. Statistical differences were observed for this ES, but a similar spatial distribution of high and low supply areas. A decrease in the supply was observed comparing the historical period and future scenarios. Maintenance of nursery conditions was validated (r(2) = 0.72) based on the protection status of the coastal zone. Results show no statistical differences and similar spatial patterns among the periods. Rocky and sandbank areas show a high supply for this ES. Limitations of our work are mainly related to the resolution of the utilised indicators.

J	Dunn, S; Gonzalez-Otalora, S				Dunn, Sarah; Gonzalez-Otalora, Samuel			Development of an Adaptive Solution to Increase Infrastructure System Resilience Based upon a Location-Allocation Methodology	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Infrastructure system; Resilience; Geographical information system (GIS); Location-allocation; Climate change	MODEL	Infrastructure systems are critical to the normal functioning of our modern communities, enabling access to essential resources and services and also providing a platform for social and economic growth. These systems are currently being subjected to a multitude of challenges and must, therefore, adapt to ensure the needs of society can continue to be met. Perhaps the most problematic of these challenges is climate change. The high level of uncertainty within long-term climate projections means that they cannot reliably be used as a basis for informed decisions to permanently alter existing assets or change the design of infrastructure assets (through alteration to design codes, for example). Therefore, we need new tools to ensure our infrastructure systems are resilient by using adaptable approaches, which do not require accurate long-term climate scenarios to inform decisions. This paper develops a modified location-allocation modeling approach, which can provide an adaptive solution that utilizes deployable resources to increase the resilience of infrastructure systems. Specifically, this approach can be applied to indicate the optimal location to store resources so as to ensure a baseline level of service to our communities, either through the protection of critical assets (e.g., mobile flood defenses and grit storage) or the provision of a temporary service (e.g., electricity generators). The approach we have developed is based upon a modified location-allocation analysis, which determines an optimal location for one or more resource sites to provide supplies to a given set of demand points (e.g., hospitals and community centers). The novel contribution of the work is to the development of a methodology to assign a weighting to assets with only qualitative attributes within the location-allocation methodology. We use ArcGIS to undertake the analysis and apply our methodology to a real-world infrastructure case study and natural hazard threat.

Managed aquifer recharge implementation criteria to achieve water sustainability	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Aquifer storage; Climate change; Decision framework; Groundwater recharge; Water treatment	TRACE ORGANIC-CHEMICALS; PHARMACEUTICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WASTE-WATER; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; HEAVY-METALS; ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE; BANK FILTRATION; RECOVERY ASR	Depiction of groundwater is accelerated due to an increase in water demand for applications in urbanized areas, agriculture sectors, and energy extraction, and dwindling surface water during changing climate. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is one of the several methods that can help achieve long-term water sustainability by inch asing the natural recharge of groundwater reservoirs with water from non-traditional supplies such as excess surface water, stormwater, and treated wastewater. Despite the multiple benefits of MAR, the wide-scale implementation of MAR is lacking, partly because of challenges to select the location for MAR implementation and identify the MAR type based on site conditions and needs. In this review, we provide an overview of MAR types with a basic framework to select and implement specific MAR at a site based on water availability and quality, land use, source type, soil, and aquifer properties. Our analysis of 1127 MAR projects shows that MAR has been predominantly implemented in sites with sandy clay loam soil (soil group C) and with access to river water for recharge. Spatial analysis reveals that many regions with depleting water storage have opportunities to implement MAR projects. Analyzing data from 34 studies where stormwater was used for recharge, we show that MAR can remove dissolved organic carbon, most metals, E. col/ but not efficient at removing most trace organics, and entenococci. Removal efficiency depends on the type of MAR. In the end, we highlight potential challenges for implementing MAR at a site and additional benefits such as minimizing land subsidence, flood risk. augmenting low dry-season flow, and minimizing salt-water intrusion. These results could help identify locations in the water-stressed regions to implement specific MAR for water sustainability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Past variation in Lower Peace River ice-jam flood frequency	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Peace-Athabasca Delta; ice-jam flood frequency; WAC Bennett Dam; river regulation; climate change; paleolimnology	ATHABASCA DELTA; CLIMATIC VARIABILITY; CANADA; IMPACTS; BASIN	Opposing interpretations of Lower Peace River ice-jam flood frequency data sets are at the centre of identifying causes of reduced freshwater availability in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (northern Alberta), a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance and a major contributor to Wood Buffalo National Park's listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Recently, conclusions drawn from statistical inference of traditional knowledge and historical observation sources suggested that flood frequency was accelerating during 1880-1967 and then declined coincident with hydroelectric regulation of Peace River flow since 1968 that altered the river's hydrograph. In contrast, prior paleolimnological measurements of laminated sediments from oxbow lakes proximal to the Peace River have, along with alternate presentation of the traditional knowledge and historical observation sources, identified flood frequency was in decline for decades preceding river regulation due to climate change since the Little Ice Age. Here we revisit these data sets and, specifically, review their inherent uncertainties to assess their value and limitations. The notion of increasing versus decreasing flood frequency in the decades preceding river regulation (1880-1967) is tested using previously published paleohydrological records from perched lakes in the delta. Those records from lakes most proximal and sensitive to changes in the flow regime of the Peace River show increasing influence of lake evaporation during 1880-1967, consistent with long-term decline in flood frequency. Reconciling uncertainties of multiple lines-of-evidence and their findings should inform decisions by UNESCO on the World Heritage status of Wood Buffalo National Park and execution of the park's federally funded Action Plan. New paleolimnological studies that have recently been launched will continue to probe the hydrological history of the Peace-Athabasca Delta to serve as a foundation for effective stewardship.

The rise and demise of Mapungubwe has long been linked to significant climate changes such as increased rainfall that would have supported intensive agro-pastoral activities and demographic growth, later declining due to the onset of drier conditions. Accordingly, during the Little Ice Age (1300-1850 AD), drier and cooler climate resulted in environmental deterioration, ultimately leading to the abandonment of Mapungubwe. This model is based on archaeological survey records and oral histories, with very limited regional climatic/environmental data. This paper presents three types of datasets: historical records; modern rainfall patterns, including field observations made from geoarchaeological records of soil sequences; and chemical analyses (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) to examine climate variability and social complexity in Iron Age southern Africa using historical ecology frameworks. The integrated analysis of these datasets indicates that hydrological changes in the Shashe-Limpopo basin are highly influenced by seasonal variability and distribution of rainfall. The proposed alternating periods of high and low rainfall in the present study suggests the potential for flooding episodes of differing severity, while geoarchaeological data indicate an active landscape with alternating sequences of profile development and soil disturbance. Therefore, environmental deterioration cannot simply be avoided by migration. In fact, where heavy rains in the catchment area cause flooding, they also bring both moisture and deposit rich silt, valuable for the growth of vegetation and crops. Instead, the argument put forward is that many aspects, both cultural and environmental factors, influenced societal decline in the Shashe-Limpopo basin.

The river crosses the high relief of the Pontide mountain range through successive narrow gorges and strike-slip basins formed by the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) System. We have investigated this fluvial record along the course of the main river channel at its lower reaches. The study site is located south of the Adapazari Basin, ~50 km inland from the Black Sea, where remnant floodplains are preserved as a three-step terrace staircase resulting from continuous uplift to the south of the NAF. The combination of high resolution mapping with a detailed luminescence (OSL and p-IR-IRSL) and radiocarbon geochronology has shed light on changes in the level of the Black Sea and in the hydrological system during the late Pleistocene to recent. The last glacial period is represented by the highest terrace (T3) indicating deposition during marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 in between two low stands of the Black Sea. Following a long-term erosional period initiated prior to last glacial maximum (LGM), the initiation of the deposition (T2) was synchronous with the proposed catastrophic sea level rise of the Black Sea (cal. C-14 9.3 ka BP) which continued throughout the Holocene until the Roman warm period (1.8 ka BP). The late-Holocene to recent morphological evolution of the region is marked with two sequential erosional and depositional (T1 and T0) periods, which can be correlated with the well-documented historical climate shifts affecting the hydrological system. These results reveal that the erosional and depositional periods on the Sakarya River floodplain are controlled by major sea level changes and climatically induced fluctuations in discharge and sediment supply.

Integrating multidisciplinary instruments for assessing coastal vulnerability to erosion and sea level rise: lessons and challenges from the Adriatic Sea, Italy	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Monitoring; Multi-scale modelling; Climate change; Coastal vulnerability	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; LOW CRESTED STRUCTURES; GULF-OF-TRIESTE; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; WATERSHED MANAGEMENT; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; DECISION-SUPPORT; WAVE MODEL; BEACH; OCEAN	The evolution of coastal and transitional environments depends upon the interplay of human activities and natural drivers, two factors that are strongly connected and many times conflicting. The urge for efficient tools for characterising and predicting the behaviour of such systems is nowadays particularly pressing, especially under the effects of a changing climate, and requires a deeper understanding of the connections among different drivers and different scales. To this aim, the present paper reviews the results of a set of interdisciplinary and coordinated experiences carried out in the Adriatic Sea (north-eastern Mediterranean region), discussing state-of-the art methods for coastal dynamics assessment and monitoring, and suggests strategies towards a more efficient coastal management. Coupled with detailed geomorphological information, the methodologies currently available for evaluating the different components of relative sea level rise facilitate a first identification of the flooding hazard in coastal areas, providing a fundamental element for the prioritization and identification of the sustainability of possible interventions and policies. In addition, hydro- and morpho-dynamic models are achieving significant advances in terms of spatial resolution and physical insight, also in a climatological context, improving the description of the interactions between meteo-oceanographic processes at the regional scale to coastal dynamics at the local scale. We point out that a coordinated use of the described tools should be promptly promoted in the design of survey and monitoring activities as well as in the exploitation of already collected data. Moreover, expected benefits from this strategy include the production of services and infrastructures for coastal protection with a focus on short-term forecast and rapid response, enabling the implementation of an event-oriented sampling strategy.

Holocene landscape dynamics in the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel region at the northern edge of the Thar Desert, northwest India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EGU Session on GM6.2/SSS3.10 on Geoarchaeology - Human Adaptation to Landscape Changes, Landscape Resilience to Human Impact and Integrating Palaeoevnironmental and Archaeological Records	2016	Vienna, AUSTRIA	EGU		Indus Civilisation; Fluvial; Aeolian; OSL dating; Palaeoenvironment; Drylands; Northern Thar Desert	LUMINESCENCE CHRONOLOGY; SUMMER MONSOON; SARASWATI RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS; SOUTHWEST MONSOON; SABARMATI RIVER; ABRUPT CHANGES; ASIAN MONSOON; DOSE-RATE	Precession-forced change in insolation has driven de-intensification of the Asian Monsoon systems during the Holocene. Set against this backdrop of a weakening monsoon, Indus Civilisation populations occupied a number of urban settlements on the Ghaggar-Hakra plains during the mid-Holocene from 4.5 ka until they were abandoned by around 3.9 ka. Regional climatic variability has long been cited as a potential factor in the transformation of Indus society, however there remain substantial gaps in the chronological framework for regional climatic and environmental change at the northern margin of the Thar Desert. This makes establishing a link between climate, environment and society challenging. This paper presents 24 optically stimulated luminescence ages from a mixture of 11 fluvial and aeolian sedimentological sites on the Ghaggar-Hakra floodplain/interfluve, an area which was apparently densely populated during the Indus urban phase and subsequently. These ages identify fluvial deposition which mostly pre-dates 5 ka, although fluvial deposits are detected in the Ghaggar palaeochannel at 3.8 ka and 3.0 ka, post-dating the decline of urbanism. Aeolian accumulation phases occur around 9 ka, 6.5 ka, 2.8 ka and 1.7 ka. There is no clear link to a 4.2 ka abrupt climate event, nor is there a simple switch between dominant fluvial deposition and aeolian accumulation, and instead the OSL ages reported present a view of a highly dynamic geomorphic system during the Holocene. The decline of Indus urbanism was not spatially or temporally instantaneous, and this paper suggests that the same can be said for the geomorphic response of the northern Thar to regional climate change.

Exploring the benefits and dis-benefits of climate migration as an adaptive strategy along the rural-peri-urban continuum in Namibia	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate mobilities; Environmental migrants; Migration dynamics; Peri-urban settlements; Rural-urban migration; Sub-Saharan Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; LAND DEGRADATION; OUT-MIGRATION; URBANIZATION; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; CONTEXT; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE	The scale of climate migration across the Global South is expected to increase during this century. By 2050, millions of Africans are likely to consider, or be pushed into, migration because of climate hazards contributing to agricultural disruption, water and food scarcity, desertification, flooding, drought, coastal erosion, and heat waves. However, the migration-climate nexus is complex, as is the question of whether migration can be considered a climate change adaptation strategy across both the rural and urban space. Combining data from household surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources related to regional disaster, demographic, resource, and economic trends between 1990 and 2020 from north central and central dryland Namibia, we investigate (i) human migration flows and the influence of climate hazards on these flows and (ii) the benefits and dis-benefits of migration in supporting climate change adaptation, from the perspective of migrants (personal factors and intervening obstacles), areas of origin, and areas of destination. Our analysis suggests an increase in climate-related push factors that could be driving rural out-migration from the north central region to peri-urban settlements in the central region of the country. While push factors play a role in rural-urban migration, there are also several pull factors (many of which have been long-term drivers of urban migration) such as perceived higher wages, diversity of livelihoods, water, health and energy provisioning, remittances, better education opportunities, and the exchange of non-marketed products. Migration to peri-urban settlements can reduce some risks (e.g. loss of crops and income due to climate extremes) but amplify others (e.g. heat stress and insecure land tenure). Adaptation at both ends of the rural-urban continuum is supported by deeply embedded linkages in a model of circular rural-urban-rural migration and interdependencies. Results empirically inform current and future policy debates around climate mobilities in Namibia, with wider implications across Africa.	[Thorn, Jessica P.

These changes in the distribution of precipitations could heighten the intensity or frequency of floods, a natural hazard that concerns 80% of Quebec's riverside municipalities. For the health and safety of the at-risk population, it is very important to make sure they have acquired necessary adaptive behaviors against flooding hazard. However, there has been no assessment of these flood adaptation behaviors to date. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and validate five indices of adaptation to flooding. Methods: A sample of 1951 adults completed a questionnaire by phone. The questionnaire, specifically developed for this study, measured whether they did or did not adopt the behaviors that are proposed by public health officials to protect themselves against flooding. Results: The results of the item, confirmatory factor, and multiple correspondence analyses contributed to the development of five indices corresponding to the adaptation behaviors to adopt according to the chronology of events: (a) pre-alert preventive behaviors, (b) behaviors to carry out after the alert is issued, (c) behaviors to adopt during a flood not requiring evacuation, (d) behaviors to adopt during a flood requiring evacuation, and (e) post-flood behaviors. The results of this study also showed that people who perceive a risk of flooding in their home in the next 5 years tend to adopt more preventive behaviors and adaptation behaviors than those who perceive little or no risk at all. They also reveal that people who feel more adverse effects on their physical or mental health tend to adopt more adaptive behaviors than those who feel little or no adverse effects on their health. Conclusion: Across a series of psychometric analyses, the results showed that these flood adaptation indices could properly measure a vast range of adaptive behaviors according to the chronology of events. Therefore, researchers, public health agencies, and professionals can use them to monitor the evolution of individuals' adaptive behaviors during floods.

Evaluating the Economic Cost of Coastal Flooding	AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM-SURGE; IMPACTS; 21ST-CENTURY; ADAPTATION; DAMAGE; MODEL	Sea level rise will cause spatial shifts in economic activity over the next 200 years. Using a spatially disaggregated, dynamic model of the world economy, this paper estimates the consequences of probabilistic projections of local sea level changes. Under an intermediate scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, permanent flooding is projected to reduce global real GDP by 0.19 percent in present value terms. By the year 2200, a projected 1.46 percent of the population will be displaced. Losses in coastal localities are much larger. When ignoring the dynamic response of investment and migration, the loss in real GDP in 2200 increases from 0.11 percent to 4.5 percent.

Given the vulnerabilities of second homes to natural disasters, it is important to learn how their owners consider the related risks. This paper investigates the extreme weather-event risk perceptions and their preconditions between second-home owners and local people in the Little Beskid mountains in Poland. The results show that, despite significant differences in social, demographic and presence-absence terms, the two populations were very similar with respect to risk perception. It then lays the ground for community preparedness and successful recovery from extreme weather hazards.

Floods occur across many space and timescales, from very localized flash flood events to slow propagation of discharge peaks in large rivers. We discuss here how satellite data can help us understand the genesis and impacts of these flood events, monitor their evolution, and better constrain prediction models, thereby improving early warning and population protection. To illustrate these topics, we reanalyze major flood events that occurred in Niger, Mozambique, Central African Republic and Ivory Coast, using satellite information.

Case study: Tunja, Colombia	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA			English	Article						Floods; risk management; social perception; sustainable urban development; vulnerability	SYSTEM	In an increasingly urbanized world, local governments have greater responsibility to implement practical measures against climate change. Measures that help prevent, mitigate, and efficiently overcome events such as floods, focusing on sustainable urban development. The present project is developed for the city of Tunja, Colombia. In this, sectors with high flood threat are evaluated, according to the main bodies of water that cross the urban area, Jordan River and La Vega River. The research purpose is to provide strategies that promote the correct flood risk management in the municipality. There are three priority topics, (1) importance of urban planning and management, (2) study of vulnerability from the social perception of the exposed inhabitants, and, finally, (3) a proposal of strategic alternatives according to the analyzed risk. It is aimed at the timely prevention promotion and affectations reduction, a product of precipitation events due to climatic variability.

J	Scamardo, JE; Wohl, E				Scamardo, Julianne E.; Wohl, Ellen			Recognizing the ephemeral stream floodplain: Identification and importance of flood zones in drylands	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						attenuation; climate change; floodplain storage; habitat; mapping	SAN-PEDRO RIVER; SOLAR-ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; ORGANIC-CARBON STORAGE; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; NORTHERN PLAINS; FLASH-FLOOD; CHANNEL-PATTERN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WOODY DEBRIS	Previous syntheses of the hydrologic, geomorphic and biotic functions of floodplains have largely integrated research conducted along perennial stream networks, despite a growing body of literature on analogous functional floodplain zones along ephemeral streams. Although variable inundation characteristic of ephemeral streams complicates the delineation between channel and floodplain, ephemeral stream floodplains are distinct landforms that are hypothesized to host similar ecosystem functions as perennial stream floodplains, including the attenuation of downstream fluxes and provision of habitat to diverse flora and fauna. Here, we review the literature on dryland ephemeral stream floodplains in order to identify: (1) common definitions and styles; (2) unique hydrologic, geomorphic and biotic functions separate from uplands or channels; (3) current and future anthropogenic and natural stressors to such functions; and (4) knowledge gaps regarding research on ephemeral stream floodplains. Although active floodplain definitions follow criteria commonly used in perennial stream corridors, the extent of ephemeral stream floodplains is typically defined by less frequent floods. A set of floodplain styles emerges from the literature dependent on confinement and the presence of channelized streamflow. Functions related to attenuation and storage are typically concentrated in unconfined, channelled floodplains. The temporary storage of sediment and subsurface water in ephemeral stream floodplains makes them disproportionately important for biogeochemical cycling and hosts to richer, denser and more diverse vegetation communities compared with surrounding uplands. Many functions of ephemeral stream floodplains are also found in perennial counterparts, but variable flow regimes and sediment loads in ephemeral streams can potentially impact rates and magnitudes of comparable processes and functions. Future research needs to incorporate a holistic view of the ephemeral stream corridor-including channels and floodplains-to better understand current and future fluvial processes and cascading impacts in drylands globally. Floodplains in ephemeral stream corridors share temporary inundation with dry channels, yet variations in hydrologic, geomorphic and biotic characteristics lead to unique functions in overbank areas. Based on a synthesis of the prior literature, definitions of the floodplain boundary and extent were revisited, and distinct floodplain styles were identified. Ephemeral stream floodplains host hydrologic, geomorphic and biotic functions unique from the channel and uplands, which could be altered by future climate change, land use change or other anthropogenic stressors.image	[Scamardo, Julianne E.; Wohl, Ellen] Colorado State Univ, Dept Geosci, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Scamardo, Julianne E.] Univ Vermont, Dept Geog & Geosci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA	Colorado State University; University of Vermont	Scamardo, JE (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Geog & Geosci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.	julianne.scamardo@uvm.edu			NSF Graduate Research Fellowship	NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))	Funding was provided by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship awarded to J.E.S.

Decline in annual survival of American oystercatchers wintering in Florida linked to extreme high tides	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						American oystercatcher; Barker model; Florida; Haematopus palliates; overwintering; site fidelity; survival	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CALIDRIS-CANUTUS-RUFA; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; GULF-OF-MEXICO; HAEMATOPUS-PALLIATUS; HABITAT QUALITY; SITE FIDELITY; RED KNOTS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SUWANNEE RIVER	The projected effects of climate change include an increase in the frequency and intensity of storm events and sea-level rise, which can erode and degrade coastal habitats and affect coastal-dependent species. The American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is a shorebird that is dependent on low-lying coastal habitats for breeding and wintering and is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea-level rise. We investigated the degree to which changes in duration of flooding of roosts affected annual survival of individuals in a large wintering population of oystercatchers on the Nature Coast of Florida, USA. We used 12 years (2007-2018) of mark-resight data from a large-scale monitoring effort that included winter resights on Florida's Nature Coast to model the annual survival and site fidelity of sub-adult and adult birds. High-tide roosts are limited in number and are a potential population-limiting factor for wintering oystercatchers. We assessed the effect of roost inundation on survival and site fidelity by incorporating the number of hours roosts were at risk of inundation during extreme higher high tide events each winter. We documented a 7.3% decline in annual survival, from 0.96 to 0.89, over the study period, and survival rates did not differ between age stages. The decline was associated with an increase in the duration of extreme higher high tides, which had a negative effect (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.006 to -0.001) on survival. Site fidelity varied across the study period and among age stages, with lower rates in sub-adults (0.85; 95% CI = 0.80-0.89) than in adults (0.94; 95% CI = 0.89-0.97). The duration of nest and roost inundation are among the greatest threats to oystercatcher populations, and high-tide roosts are an important habitat component for wintering populations on the Nature Coast. Sea-level rise is predicted to increase, which will contribute to the increasing inundation duration of coastal habitats. Our results underscore the importance of conservation and restoration of important wintering habitats to mitigate threats to the population viability of oystercatchers in Florida and throughout their range.

This study used a three-step approach to investigate the issue: trend analysis, bibliometric analysis, and the development of a conceptual TOE framework. The trend analysis identified water conservation and water crisis as the most frequently mentioned keywords, suggesting the need to address public concern for these issues. The bibliometric analysis found that 37% of the articles were published in the last three years, and environmental science and technology was the most common field of study. The TOE framework was used to link and group the keywords (risk factors) from the articles into three categories: technology, organization, and environment. This framework provides a way to understand the different factors that contribute to water scarcity and to develop strategies for addressing these risk factors. The three risk factors with the highest scores were statistical analysis (technology), climate change (environment), and uncertainty (environment). In the technology category, statistical analysis, sustainable development, and water quality were the most important risk factors. In the organization category, water management, governance, and water markets were the most important risk factors. In the environment category, climate change, uncertainty, and flood were the most important risk factors. This study is expected to provide valuable insights into the research trends that are important for achieving sustainability in water resource management, both in conventional and academic studies, over the past decade.

J	Parreira, N; Mouro, C				Parreira, Natacha; Mouro, Carla			Living by the sea: place attachment, coastal risk perception, and eco-anxiety when coping with climate change	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						place attachment; risk perception; eco-anxiety; coping strategies; trust in authorities; coastal areas; Aveiro	STRATEGIES; EMOTIONS; TRUST; PREPAREDNESS; ATTITUDES	Climate change poses major threats to coastal regions. In Portugal, the Aveiro district is one of the most vulnerable areas due to urbanized areas' exposure to the dangers of rising water. The prospect of flood threats can trigger a range of cognitions and emotions that affect adaptation and mitigation measures' success. This study sought to examine whether active and traditional place attachment is associated with residents' active and passive coping strategies to deal with the risk of rising water levels. An additional aim was to clarify whether these relationships are mediated by risk perception and eco-anxiety. The links between individuals' level of trust in authorities and coping mechanisms were also examined. An online questionnaire was completed by 197 Aveiro residents. The data show that active place attachment is connected to greater risk perception, eco-anxiety, and adoption of active coping strategies (e.g., problem solving). Low eco-anxiety was also found to have a positive effect on active coping strategies. Lower trust in the responsible authorities was additionally associated with active coping mechanisms. Overall, the results support the sequential mediation model for active coping but not for passive coping. The findings reinforce the need to consider cognitive factors (e.g., risk perception) and emotional factors (e.g., place attachment and practical eco-anxiety) to understand more fully how coastal residents deal with flood threats. Practical implications for policymakers are discussed.

Based on the daily rainfall data of 609 stations during 1958-2017, the Pearson-III curve, least square method, F-test, and other methods were adopted to study the changes in design rainstorms and the response to extreme rainstorms over nearly 60 years in China, and to explore the flood control capacity of engineering during climate change. The conclusions are as follows. (1) There is a general increasing trend in extreme rainstorm events in China. Most extreme rainstorm indices present upward trends in East China (EC), South China (SC), Central China (CC), Northwest China (NW), and Southwest China (SW) and downward trends in Northeast China (NE) and North China (NC). (2) The temporal series of design rainstorms shows general growth under each return period in China. In EC, SC, and SW, the design rainstorms increase significantly with rates of 3.0, 3.1, and 1.3 mm/10a, respectively, in the 20-year return period, while they decrease significantly by -2.0 mm/10a in NC (p < 0.05). (3) Design rainstorms have a positive response to extreme rainstorm events, which resulted in increasing rainstorms in a specific return period in EC, SC, NW, and SW. These results can promote the revision of engineering design standards and improve the flood control capability of engineering.

However, changing flood characteristics caused by climate change necessitate more accurate assessments of the probabilities of rare flood events. This study aims to develop a flood hazard map based on the nonstationary flood frequency using a generalized extreme value distribution model for the Becho floodplain in the upper Awash River basin. The distributional location parameter was modeled as a function of rainfall amount of different durations, annual total precipitation from wet days, yearly mean maximum temperature and time as covariates. The one-dimensional Hydrological Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic model with steady flow analysis was used to generate flood hazard map input, depth and velocity, and inundation extent for different return periods. The result indicated that the model as a function of rainfall, such as monthly rainfall (August) and annual wet day precipitation, provided the best fit to the observed hydrological data. Rainfall as a covariate can explain the variation in the peak flood series. The developed hazard map based on depth alone and the combination of depth and velocity thresholds resulted in more than 70% of the floodplain area being classified as a high hazard zone under 2, 25, 50, and 100-years return periods. The current study assists water resource managers in considering changing environmental factors and an alternative flood frequency model for developing flood hazard management and mitigation strategies.

Analysis of the evolution pattern and potential causes of extreme hydrometeorological events is of great significance for flood prevention, mitigation and water resource planning in the basin. Based on the measured meteorological data in the HRB for 1963-2018, statistical analysis methods were used to test variations on extreme hydrometeorological events (precipitation and drought). Possible effects of global warming, atmospheric circulation patterns and sunspots on the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological events were also explored, effectively identifying the common influencing factors of extreme precipitation and drought events. The results show that (1) Extreme hydrometeorological events in the upper reaches are serious, but extreme precipitation tends to slow with time; the increase in extreme precipitation indices in the middle reaches deserves attention, while drought conditions are relatively mild; the drought trend in the lower reaches is significant, and extreme precipitation has improved. (2) Each inactive image for different periods is loaded onto the canvas, and a dynamic graph is used to display the temporal and spatial evolution pattern of extreme hydrometeorological events. (3) Global mean near-surface temperature anomalies (GTEM) are positively correlated with most extreme precipitation indices but negatively correlated with drought indices. The increase in the number of sunspots eased extreme precipitation and worsened drought.

Here we illustrate the effects of recent glacier recession on the development of landforms and sediments at Ponkar Glacier, a debris-covered glacier in the Manaslu area of the Nepal Himalaya using a combi-nation of 2019 RapidEye satellite image (5 m spatial res-olution), drone imagery (50 cm) and field observations. We describe the key features of the glacier and its ice-surface morphology, including size and extent of flow units and tributary glaciers, supraglacial features of the debris cover and vegetation. Geomorphological mapping is used to describe the moraines, proglacial geomorphology, outwash plains and proglacial streams, the development of new ice-marginal ponds and changes in vegetation. Moraines generally have steep and rapidly degrading inner faces and mature vegetation, including trees, on their outer flanks. They are typically com-posed of diamicton and silty or sandy boulder gravel. Large outer moraines are separated from the surrounding val-ley sides by 'ablation valleys'. We conclude by putting the landforms and sediments developed at Ponkar Glacier into a discussion of the likely future evolution of high-eleva-tion debris-covered glaciers.

This paper analyzes the impact of climate change, urbanization, and integrated disaster drivers on urban pluvial flooding hazards, starting from the disaster-causing mechanisms of urban pluvial flooding in China. This paper then analyzes the main features and progress of urban pluvial flooding governance in China. In particular, this paper describes the progress of sponge cities in China. On the basis of the above contents, this paper describes three manifestations of the fragmentation dilemma at the level of governance, namely, fragmentation in value integration due to conflicting management orders and service values, fragmentation in resource and power allocation due to the lack of vertical top-level design and blurred horizontal departmental management boundaries, and fragmentation in policy formulation and implementation due to outdated urban flood control standards and interdepartmental information compartmentalization. In response to the fragmentation dilemma in urban pluvial flooding management in China, this paper introduces the concept of holistic governance and clarifies the path of urban waterlogging management, i.e., forming a collaborative and diversified governance subjects, deeply optimizing the organizational structure of urban waterlogging management, creating a mature information-based governance platform, and improving the legal and rule of law construction model. This paper is informative for understanding the governance of urban pluvial flooding in China from a government-led management level.

Temporal evolution of mid-tropospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over the Indian Ocean	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CO2; AIRS; Indian Ocean; Trends; Climate change	ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; AIRS RETRIEVED CO2; MAUNA-LOA; ANTHROPOGENIC CO2; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; ACIDIFICATION; CHEMISTRY; TRENDS	The rapid increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities aids global warming that demands immediate attention and policy actions. The changes in weather patterns, such as winds, temperature and precipitation, leading to floods and droughts are linked to the increasing greenhouse gases including CO2. This situation warrants close and continuous monitoring of atmospheric CO2. Here, the midtropospheric CO2 from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is analysed for the past 14 years over Indian Ocean. The northern hemisphere has a higher CO2 concentration than the southern hemisphere, as most of the landmasses with significant CO2 sources are present in the former region. Seasonal variations show the highest CO2 concentration over the north Indian Ocean (NIO) during MAM (March, April and May), about 388.55 ppm, and lowest during ON (October and November), about 386.92 ppm. In contrast, the south Indian Ocean shows the highest, but the magnitude is smaller than that over NIO, during December, January and February. Arabian Sea (AS) exhibits smaller CO2 concentrations compared to that over Bay of Bengal (BoB). However, AS shows the highest trend of 2.13 ppm/year during the post-monsoon season (ON). The seasonal correlation analysis of the temperature at 10 m and sea surface temperature against mid-tropospheric CO2 shows a higher positive correlation for BoB. These analyses, therefore, provide a detailed understanding of the basin-wide seasonal and interannual trends of mid-tropospheric CO2 over Indian Ocean.

These advances include sophisticated ways to date previous events, two- and three-dimensional runout models including multi-phase flows and debris entrainment options, and applications of extreme value statistics to assemble frequency-magnitude analyses. Pertinent questions have remained the same: How often, how big, how fast, how deep, how intense, and how far? Similarly, although major life loss attributable to debris flows can often, but not always, be avoided in developed nations, debris flows remain one of the principal geophysical killers in mountainous terrains. Substantial differences in debris-flow hazard persist between nations. Some rely on a design magnitude associated with a specific return period; others use relationships between intensity and frequency; and some allow for, but do not mandate, in-depth quantitative risk assessments. Differences exist in the management of debris-flow risks, from highly sophisticated and nation-wide applied protocols to retroaction in which catastrophic debris flows occur before they are considered for mitigation. Two factors conspire to challenge future generations of debris-flow researchers, practitioners, and decision makers: Population growth and climate change, which are increasingly manifested by augmenting hydroclimatic extremes. While researchers will undoubtedly finesse future remote sensing, dating, and runout techniques and models, practitioners will need to focus on translating those advances into practical cost-efficient tools and integrating those tools into long-term debris-flow risk management.

In this paper, a novel risk assessing approach based on a climate risk assessment framework with copula-based approaches is proposed. Firstly, extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) and their marginal distributions are estimated for historical and future periods. Next, the joint probability distributions of extreme precipitation are constructed by copula methods and tested by goodness-of-fit indices. The future joint probabilities and joint return periods (JRPs) of the EPIs are then evaluated. Finally, change rates of JRPs for future periods are estimated to assess climate risk with the quantitative data of exposure and vulnerability of a protected target. An actual application in Taiwan Island is successfully conducted for climate risk assessment with the impacts of extreme precipitation. The results indicate that most of regions in Taiwan Island might have higher potential climate risk under different scenarios in the future. The future joint probabilities of precipitation extremes might cause the high risk of landslide and flood disasters in the mountainous area, and of inundation in the plain area. In sum, the proposed climate risk assessing approach is expected to be useful for assisting decision makers to draft adaptation strategies and face high risk of the possible occurrence of natural disasters.

They have been increasingly reported to occur in the past decades in E.A, and it is crucial to understand their underlying risk factors before planning their relevant mitigation interventions. In this case, drawing on the results of a rapid review conducted a priori, this study used the Haddon matrix (HM) to explore and analyze the anthropogenic drivers of floods in ten partner countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in E.A, including Burundi, Djibouti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda between 1990 and 2021. Accordingly, this study notes that the anthropogenic drivers that previously contributed to floods in the 10 partner countries of BRI in E.A were diverse, multifaceted, interrelated, and revolved around challenges of environmental degradation and encroachment on biodiversity and ecosystems, infrastructural and drainage systems, urbanization and physical planning, and socioeconomic development and the livelihood of the population. Efforts to tackle these challenges ought to be aligned with the implementation of the BRI agenda. In particular, this should draw on various opportunities contained in the BRI, as well as the Chinese success and vast experience in poverty alleviation and DRR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the HM in exploring the anthropogenic drivers of floods in the context of the BRI partner countries in the E.A and should act as a reference for further research on a similar subject matter.

Lisa			Setting the stage: How abrupt climate change, geomorphic thresholds, and drought control flood response in the lower Tennessee River, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Holocene; Paleofloods; Extreme floods; Climate dynamics; Drought; Geomorphic threshold	HOLOCENE; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; MULTIPLE; IMPACTS; TRENDS	Extreme floods, with multi-century to millennia recurrence intervals, arise from a combination of antecedent watershed characteristics and unusual or rare atmospheric circulations that occur too infrequently to discern drivers from instrumental records. Few stream gauge records in the United States contain 100 years or more of annual peak flow data, meaning rare extreme floods are underrepresented in the peak flow population. We synthesized approximately 8,000 years of paleoflood hydrologic data from multiple studies and various landforms (floodplains, rock shelters, and caves) conducted in the Tennessee River Valley between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Florence, Alabama, to examine Holocene flood variability. Extreme floods (>11,000 m3/s) clustered around-7,900, 6,000-4,90 0, and-1,000-80 cal yrs BP. More moderate floods occurred between 4,800 and 2,000 cal yrs BP. We compared flood variability in the Tennessee Valley to Holocene paleorecords available in North America. All periods of extreme flooding occurred during large-scale, abrupt climate transitions that lacked a distinct direc-tionality of temperature change (i.e., warm to cool or cool to warm). Our findings indicate that extreme floods clustered in times when (1) warm-season precipitation increased, (2) abrupt increases in pre-cipitation followed episodes of drought, and (3) the rate of change in the hydroclimate regimes was greater than the rate of morphological change in response to increased moisture, thus, exceeded geomorphic thresholds. Internal river basin factors such as drought-induced watershed changes and river morphological changes are key flood drivers that set the stage for flood response to changes in precipitation. Our findings suggest that anticipated changes to drought and precipitation intensity due to modern climate change may increase extreme floods, particularly for urban and regulated rivers not given the space for adjusting to higher precipitation variability.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ethan			Investigating uncertainties in human adaptation and their impacts on water scarcity in the Colorado river Basin, United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Reinforcement learning; Clustering analysis; Global sensitivity analysis; Coupled human-natural system; Agent-based modeling	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHT; MODELS; FLOOD; HYDROLOGY; SCIENCE; CONSERVATION; VERIFICATION; RESOURCES	The Colorado River Basin (CRB) supports the water supply for seven states and forty million people in the Western United States (US) and has been suffering an extensive drought for more than two decades. As climate change continues to reshape water resources distribution in the CRB, its impact can differ in intensity and location, resulting in variations in human adaptation behaviors. The feedback from human systems in response to the environmental changes and the associated uncertainty is critical to water resources management, especially for water-stressed basins. This paper investigates how human adaptation affects water scarcity uncertainty in the CRB and highlights the uncertainties in human behavior modeling. Our focus is on agricultural water consumption, as approximately 80% of the water consumption in the CRB is used in agriculture. We adopted a coupled agent-based and water resources modeling approach for exploring human-water system dynamics, in which an agent is a human behavior model that simulates a farmer's water consumption decisions. We examined uncertainties at the system, agent, and parameter levels through uncertainty, clustering, and sensitivity analyses. The uncertainty analysis results suggest that the CRB water system may experience 13 to 30 years of water shortage during the 2019-2060 simulation period, depending on the paths of farmers' adaptation. The clustering analysis identified three decision-making classes: bold, prudent, and forward-looking, and quantified the probabilities of an agent belonging to each class. The sensitivity analysis results indicated agents whose decision-making models require further investigation and the parameters with the higher uncertainty reduction potentials. By conducting numerical experiments with the coupled model, this paper presents quantitative and qualitative information about farmers' adaptation, water scarcity uncertainties, and future research directions for improving human behavior modeling.

Based on the vulnerability analysis framework of the vulnerability scoping diagram, a vulnerability evaluation index system for inland fisheries in China was constructed in three dimensions, including exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The entropy method was used to evaluate the flood disaster vulnerability of China's inland fisheries from 2010 to 2019 and its decomposition. The temporal and spatial differences between vulnerability and its decomposition were analyzed. Kernel density estimation and factor contribution model were used to analyze the changing trend of vulnerability and main influencing factors. The results show that: during the study period, the vulnerability of inland fisheries in China to flood disasters showed a fluctuating downward trend, and the high vulnerability areas were mainly distributed in South China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; the exposure index first decreased and then increased, and the high-exposure regions were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; the sensitivity index first decreased and then increased, and the high-sensitivity areas were concentrated in North-east China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and South China; the adaptive capacity index showed a downward trend, and the areas with lower adaptive capacity were concentrated in the South-west and North-west. From the factor contribution model, the economic losses of fishery floods and the affected area had the greatest impact on the exposure index; fingerling production and freshwater fishery production had the greatest impact on the sensitivity index; the index with a lower contribution to the adaptive capacity index was the total power of fishery machinery and fishery technology promotion. Therefore, building reservoirs, optimizing aquaculture layout and promoting fishery modernization are the keys to reducing the vulnerability of inland fisheries to flood disasters.

Shallow-Water Habitat in the Lower Columbia River Estuary: A Highly Altered System	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Habitat; River-estuary; Shallow-water habitat area; Tidal-fluvial interactions; Tidal river; Salmonids	ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION; HISTORICAL CHANGES; CLIMATE INFLUENCES; PACIFIC SALMON; FLOW; BASIN; FLOODPLAINS; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; WETLANDS	Decreases in shallow-water habitat area (SWHA) in the Lower Columbia River and Estuary (LCRE) have adversely affected salmonid populations. We investigate the causes by hindcasting SWHA from 1928 to 2004, system-wide, based on daily higher high water (HHW) and system hypsometry. Physics-based regression models are used to represent HHW along the system as a function of river inflow, tides, and coastal processes, and hypsometry is used to estimate the associated SWHA. Scenario modeling is employed to attribute SWHA losses to levees, flow regulation, diversion, navigational development, and climate-induced hydrologic change, for subsidence scenarios of up to 2 m, and for 0.5 m fill. For zero subsidence, the system-wide annual-average loss of SWHA is 55 +/- 5%, or 51x10(5) ha/year; levees have caused the largest decrease (54(-14)(+5) %, or similar to 50x10(5) ha/year). The loss in SWHA due to operation of the hydropower system is small, but spatially and seasonally variable. During the spring freshet critical to juvenile salmonids, the total SWHA loss was 63(-3)(+2) %, with the hydropower system causing losses of 5-16% (depending on subsidence). Climate change and navigation have caused SWHA losses of 5(-5)(+16) % and 4(-6)(+14) %, respectively, but with high spatial variability; irrigation impacts have been small. Uncertain subsidence causes most of the uncertainty in estimates; the sum of the individual factors exceeds the total loss, because factors interact. Any factor that reduces mean or peak flows (reservoirs, diversion, and climate change) or alters tides and along-channel slope (navigation) becomes more impactful as assumed historical elevations are increased to account for subsidence, while levees matter less.

In this study, data from 1842 meteorological stations in the Huang-Huai-Hai-Yangtze River Basin and 7 climate models of CMIP6 were used to obtain the historical and future precipitation data using the Anusplin interpolation, BMA method, and a non-stationary deviation correction technique. The temporal and spatial variations of extreme precipitation in the four basins were analysed from 1960 to 2100. The correlation between extreme precipitation indices and their relationship with geographical factors was also analysed. The result of the study indicates that: (1) in the historical period, CDD and R99pTOT showed an upward trend, with growth rates of 14.14% and 4.78%, respectively. PRCPTOT showed a downward trend, with a decreasing rate of 9.72%. Other indices showed minimal change. (2) Based on SSP1-2.6, the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme precipitation changed by approximately 5% at SSP3-7.0 and 10% at SSP5-8.5. The sensitivity to climate change was found to be highest in spring and autumn. The drought risk decreased, while the flood risk increased in spring. The drought risk increased in autumn and winter, and the flood risk increased in the alpine climate area of the plateau in summer. (3) Extreme precipitation index is significantly correlated with PRCPTOT in the future period. Different atmospheric circulation factors significantly affected different extreme precipitation indices of FMB. (4) CDD, CWD, R95pD, R99pD, and PRCPTOT are affected by latitude. On the other hand, RX1day and RX5day are affected by longitude. The extreme precipitation index is significantly correlated with geographical factors, and areas above 3000 m above sea level are more sensitive to climate change.

J	Gitau, PN; Duvail, S; Verschuren, D				Gitau, Peter N.; Duvail, Stephanie; Verschuren, Dirk			Evaluating the combined impacts of hydrological change, coastal dynamics and human activity on mangrove cover and health in the Tana River delta, Kenya	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mangroves; Landcover change; Precipitation; Hydrology; Tana River delta; Kenya	SEA-LEVEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FORESTS; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; DEPOSITION; RESPONSES; SYSTEMS; FLOODS; ISLAND	The long-term dynamics of tropical mangrove ecosystems, and especially how they have responded to the combined pressures of local human activity, changing river hydrology and climate-change related coastal processes are insufficiently documented. In this study we combined a chronological sequence of remote sensing data spanning the last three decades (1992-2021) with time series of river-flow and precipitation data to discriminate between the respective impacts of hydroclimatic drivers and land-use changes on mangroves of the Tana River delta in Kenya. Our land-cover analysis showed an overall increase in mangrove forest cover of 5.5% over the past 30 years, however this included a 14% increase between 1992 and 2013 followed by a 8% decrease between 2013 and 2021. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data still indicate an overall positive trend (R2 = 0.58, p< 0.01) in the overall health of Tana River delta mangroves between 1992 and 2021. We also observe positive correlations between mangrove NDVI and precipitation (R=0.41, p = 0.042) and Tana River water level (R=0.82, p< 0.0001), as well as between mangrove NDVI and modelled measures of Tana River discharge (R= 0.79, p< 0.0001) and flooded area (R=0.73, p< 0.001). Overall our results show that recent historical variation in the areal cover and health of Tana River mangroves is mainly associated with changing hydrology in the Tana River delta, but that intensifying local land use and accelerating coastal erosion has also impacted their health. We suggest that management of the Tana River delta mangroves should focus on improving Tana River flows and sediment recharge.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The August 2022 Pakistan flood shows a glimpse of the enormity and devastation that can further rise under the warming climate. The deluge caused by the floods in 2022, which badly hit the country's southern provinces, is incomparable to any recent events in terms of the vast spatial and temporal scale. The flood event is ranked second in human mortality, while this was the top event that displaced about 33 million people in Pakistan. Using observations and climate projections, we examine the causes and implications of the 2022 flood in Pakistan. Multiday (& SIM;15 days) extreme precipitation on wet antecedent soil moisture conditions was the primary driver of the flood in August 2022. The extreme precipitation in August was caused by two atmospheric rivers that passed over southern Pakistan. Streamflow simulations from the multiple hydrological models show that multiday extreme precipitation was the primary driver of floods. Several flood-affected stations experienced anomalously higher flow than the upstream stations. The 2022 Pakistan flood highlights the adaptation challenges South Asia is facing along with the substantial need for climate mitigation to reduce the risk of such events. Plain Language Summary The Pakistan flood of 2022 received a considerable attention. However, the causes and implications of the events have not been examined. Using observations, satellite data, and reanalysis products, we show that the event was caused by multiday extreme rainfall on wet antecedent conditions. The extreme rainfall was associated with the two atmospheric rivers that transported significant moisture from the Arabian Sea. The flood was primarily driven by the extreme precipitation and other factors (glacier-melt) played a secondary role. Extreme precipitation is projected to increase in a warming climate, which highlight the strong need of adaptation and mitigation.	[Nanditha, J.

Influenced by these two drivers, flood sequences may no longer satisfy the assumption of stationary, thereby making it difficult to accurately analysis flood frequency and to design water conservancy projects. Therefore, it is of great signifi-cance to analyse the non-stationary frequency of flood sequences in a changing environment. In this study, we proposed a method for conducting nonstationary flood frequency analysis caused by cascade reservoirs as well as the low-frequency climate indices. The proposed non-stationary model 2, with the explanatory variables of climate indices and modified reservoir index (MRI), was compared with the traditional stationary model and the widely used non-stationary model 1 with time as the explanatory variable. The study was conducted at six hydrological stations in the main stream and tributaries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China (considered as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area). The results of the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) showed that the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values of the proposed non-stationary model method 2 are smaller than those of the two comparison models. When the low-frequency South Oscillation Index is high or the Arctic Oscillation and North Pacific Oscillation are low, the stationary model underestimates the design value of flood quantiles compared with the non-stationary model 2. Compared with the non-stationary model 1, the MRI and low-frequency climate indices as the explanatory variables in model 2 can better describe the non-stationary characteristics of flood frequency and amplitude. addition, the non-stationary model considering external physical factors can provide better prediction of future design flood compared with two traditional models.

Accurately identifying trends in precipitation is essential for understanding the evolution of the water cycle in the context of climate change. This study uses an innovative trend analysis (ITA), an innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA), and wavelet analysis to analyze precipitation at multiple timescales (annual, seasonal, and monthly), and the influencing factors at 30 meteorological stations in the Tai Lake Basin (TLB) from 1971 to 2018. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) the annual precipitation had a significantly increasing trend, while high precipitation had the largest increasing trend, leading to a further increase in the flood risk in the TLB. The precipitation trend mainly decreased in spring and autumn, whereas it mainly increased in summer and winter. Precipitation in different months played crucial but varying roles in the corresponding seasons; there was a sharp transition trend from August to September, whereas the transition from January to February was relatively stable. 2) There was a complex nonlinear relationship between precipitation and atmospheric teleconnection. The dominant tele-correlation alone could not explain the relationship between precipitation and large-scale circulation. The highest percentage of significant power includes the optimal combination of variables meant to explain the precipitation variations. 3) The detection results from the ITA method and classic trend analysis methods (Linear regression analysis, Mann Kendall, and Modified Mann Kendall) were consistent; the non-monotonic trends masked by these methods were detectable. IPTA can systematically identify consecutive seasons and monthly transition characteristics as a supplement to ITA. This study can, therefore, provide a reference for water resource management and the prevention and control of droughts and floods.

Given the spring warming observed during the last decades, and its impact on snowmelt and hydrological processes, searching for spring climate proxies is receiving increasing attention. Tree-ring anatomical features and intra-annual widths were used to reconstruct the regional March to May mean air temperature from 1770 to 2016 in eastern boreal Canada. Nested principal component regressions calibrated on 116 years of gridded temperature data were developed from one Fraxinus nigra and 10 Pinus banksiana sites. The reconstruction indicated three distinct phases in spring temperature variability since 1770. Ample phases of multi-decadal warm and cold springs persisted until the end of the Little Ice Age (1850-1870 CE) and were gradually replaced since the 1940s by decadal to interannual variability associated with an increase in the frequency and magnitude of warm springs. Significant correlations with other paleotemperature records, gridded snow cover extent and runoff support that historical high flooding were associated with late, cold springs with heavy snow cover. Most of the high magnitude spring floods reconstructed for the nearby Harricana River also coincided with the lowest reconstructed spring temperature per decade. However, the last 40 years of observed and reconstructed mean spring temperature showed a reduction in the number of extreme cold springs contrasting with the last few decades of extreme flooding in the eastern Canadian boreal region. This result indicates that warmer late spring mean temperatures on average may contribute, among other factors, to advance the spring break-up and to likely shift the contribution of snow to rain in spring flooding processes.

Toward this end learning scenarios are needed, which are scenarios that provide information on future variable values seen not only from today (as static scenarios), but also seen from future moments in time. Decision-scientists generally develop learning scenarios themselves, mostly through time-independent (stationary) or highly simplified methods. The climate learning scenarios thus attained generally only poorly represent the uncertainties of state-of-the-art climate science and thus may lead to biased decisions. This paper first motivates the need for learning scenarios by providing a simple example to illustrate characteristics and benefits of learning scenarios. Next, we analyze how well learning scenarios represent climate uncertainties in the context of sea level rise and present a novel method called direct fit to generate climate learning scenarios that outperforms existing methods. This is illustrated by quantifying the difference of the sea level rise learning scenarios created with both methods to the original underlying scenario. The direct fit method is based on pointwise probability distributions, for example, boxplots, and hence can be applied to static scenarios as well as ensemble trajectories. Furthermore, the direct fit method offers a much simpler process for generating learning scenarios from static or "ordinary" climate scenarios. Many climate change adaptation decisions require large investments in infrastructure (e.g., dikes), while at the same time future projections about critical variables (e.g., sea level rise) are highly uncertain. Decision-scientists address these challenges with methods based on flexibility and staged decision-making. For example, a coastal decision-maker could implement a dike with a wider foundation, and, if necessary, upgrade the dike height in the future. The decision-maker will learn by observing future sea level rise if higher dike protection levels are actually necessary in the future. In order to assess whether it is economically beneficial to wait for future learning through observations, and thus to justify additional expenses for flexible infrastructure investments, learning scenarios are required. Learning scenarios provide projections of critical variables seen from today and from future moments in time. For example, learning scenarios of sea level rise contain sea level rise projections seen from 2050 onward, depending on a certain amount of sea level rise observed until 2050. In this paper, we provide a simple example to illustrate coastal decision-making with a learning scenario, propose a new method to generate learning scenarios, and apply this method to generate sea level rise learning scenarios. We show how climate learning scenarios can be applied for improving and justifying investments in flexible long-lasting infrastructureWe develop sea level rise learning scenarios based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sixth Assessment Report using a novel method termed direct fitOur new method reduces the average deviation of learning scenarios from the original data by 83% compared to standard methods	[Voelz, Vanessa; Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Voelz, Vanessa; Hinkel, Jochen] Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany	Humboldt University of Berlin	Völz, V (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany.; Völz, V (corresponding author), Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany.	vanessa.voelz@globalclimateforum.org		Volz, Vanessa/0000-0002-1450-8513	Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation); PROTECT; European Union [313917492]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [73]; Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin; Projekt DEAL;  [491192747]	Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); PROTECT; European Union(European Union (EU)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin; Projekt DEAL; 	We would like to thank Tim Hermans for providing valuable information on FACTS and feedback on our method.

J	Poschlod, B				Poschlod, Benjamin			Attributing heavy rainfall event in Berchtesgadener Land to recent climate change - Further rainfall intensification projected for the future	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						Heavy rainfall; Return level; Regional climate model; Climate change; Natural hazard	DAILY EXTREME PRECIPITATION; LARGE ENSEMBLE; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; RETURN LEVELS; RESOLUTION; ADAPTATION; WEATHER; DAMAGE; SIMULATIONS; GENERATION	On 17 July 2021, storm "Bernd" hit the alpine region of Berchtesgadener Land inducing short-duration heavy rainfall, which triggered flash floods, debris flows, landslides, and flooding. Based on the observed precipitation data and an analysis of the runoff measurements, the driver of the event is defined as a 3-h rainfall. The 50 -mem-ber single model initial-condition large ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5 under the emission scenario RCP 8.5 is employed to explore the occurrence probability of the event under historic, current, and future climate conditions. For the rainfall event, a return period of 21 years (17-25 years) is found for the current climate (2006-2035). Under historic climate (1970-1999) the event is estimated to be 3.1 (1.9-5.2) times less likely equalling a return period of 64 years (48-90 years). This is particularly critical as experience and observational data from the recent past have been crucial to the design of infrastructure and still influence current planning. For future climate conditions, the event probability is projected to increase resulting in return periods of 7.8 years (7.1-8.8 years; 2040-2069) and 4.9 years (4.6-5.4 years; 2070-2099), respectively. The future shifts in extreme precipitation must be urgently taken into account for appropriate adaptation measures.

Urban sprawl and microclimate in the Ga East municipality of Ghana	HELIYON			English	Article						Microclimate; Rainfall; Temperature; Urban sprawl; Ga east municipality	LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER CHANGE; WEST-AFRICA; IMPACT; URBANIZATION; METROPOLIS; VEGETATION; RAINFALL; SATELLITE	Climatic elements such as temperature and rainfall provide great and unquantifiable benefits to human health. However, rapid urban sprawl has the tendency to undermine these health consequences. The relationship between urban sprawl and microclimate in the Ga East Municipality has been assessed to present the extent of sprawl that inhibit temperature and rainfall in recent times. Methodologically, satellite imagery and meteorological data (minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall) from 1990 to 2020 were used. The results indicate that rapid urban sprawl in recent times has significantly undermined the local climate through land use and land cover changes. There was strong statistical relationships between temperature and built-up areas (p < 0.05), grass/shrub cover (p < 0.04) and all vegetation cover (p < 0.03). There was also strong statistical relationship between rainfall and built-up areas (p < 0.03), grass/shrub cover (p < 0.04) and all vegetation (p < 0.02). Thus, expansion in built up areas and reduced grass/shrub cover led to increases in temperature, rainfall and surface water run off while reduction in all vegetation led to increase in both temperature and rainfall. These changes in climate brought about by urban sprawl will affect crop production, increase cataclysmic floods as well as growth of some harmful insects. There is the need for the amalgamation of urban growth and climate change into spatial planning through an all-embracing approach.

The water resource is important for the ecosystem to create resilient and sustainable settlements. The imbalance between evaporation and precipitation creates either shortage or excess of water in the ecosystem. The shortage leads to water stress whereas excess causes flooding. Out of 28 states in India, Bihar is the most vulnerable state with 16.5 percent of the entire flood-prone area and 22 percent of the total flood-affected population of the country. The paper examines water stress and its relationship with flood damage in north Bihar. The paper's novelty is to identify critical districts facing water stress, flood damage and formulate intervention strategies to create a water-secure region. Using Water Poverty Index (WPI), water stress is estimated for five key components i.e. resource, access, use, capacity, and environment. WPI score is less than 0.35 in 14 districts depicting severe water stress conditions. Flood Damage Index (FDI) estimates the severity of the flood and it's impact considering three parameters i.e. population affected, area affected, and economic loss due to crop damage. Darbhanga district has a maximum FDI score of 0.84 and the least WPI score of 0.22, making it the most critical district. The analysis of WPI and FDI shall be used to devise water and disaster-related policies to alleviate water stress and promote flood-resilient development in flood-affected areas.

In order to ascertain farmers' risk behavior towards flood and their willingness to pay (WTP) for flood insurance as a strategy for climate change adaptation and agricultural sustainability, this study employed survey data collected from 480 flood-affected farm households in northern Bangladesh with experiment-based risk preference and subjective risk perception data. Farmers' flood risk perceptions and attitude were assessed through risk matrix and ELCE technique (equally likely certainty equivalent) and used as independent variables in a probit regression model. Farmers' WTP decisions were found to be influenced by a variety of factors, including land ownership status, off-farm income, flood experience, farmers' group and access to information and extension services. Additionally, the findings indicated that farmers' subjective risk perceptions and experiment-based risk aversion measures were positively and significantly linked with their decision to purchase flood insurance. Risk-averse farmers were more inclined to obtain insurance and those who perceived greater flood risk factors were more willing to pay for flood insurance than those who perceived lower risks. In designing the insurance scheme, the socio-economic features of flood affected rural farm households as well as their risk perceptions and attitudes should be considered carefully.

Until now, experimental studies were mainly focused on plant responses to individual stress, but have overlooked the complex stress response generated in plants against combined or sequential abiotic stresses, as well as their interaction with each other. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the combined and sequential abiotic stresses overlap with respect to the central nodes of their interacting signaling pathways, and their impact cannot be modelled by swimming in an individual extreme event. Taken together, deciphering the regulatory networks operative between various abiotic stresses in agronomically important crops will contribute towards designing strategies for the development of plants with tolerance to multiple stress combinations. This review provides a brief overview of the recent developments in the interactive effects of combined and sequentially occurring stresses on crop plants. We believe that this study may improve our understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms in untangling the combined stress tolerance in plants, and may also provide a promising venue for agronomists, physiologists, as well as molecular biologists.

Design process in the urban context - Mobility and health in Special Flood Hazard Area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Design thinking; Urban areas; Floods; Mobility; Resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; THINKING; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK	In developing countries, unplanned urban growth, lack of infrastructure services, pollution, diseases, and flooding generate urgent needs. Floods cause diseases and damage to countries at all levels of development because they usually lack the preparedness for current climate variability. In Brazil, Municipal Civil Defense (JMCD) - in a 600,000 inhabitants city-, together with other city agencies, established a safe route (SRP) to be implemented during flood occurrences. This map is available for download as a PDF. This work aims to present the developed methodology, tools, and ways to design, in a collaborative way, a conceptual, innovative system model capable of bringing together needs like resilience, safety and sustainability, contributing to urban resilience, mobility, risks communication and health. Different design processes: design thinking, wayfinding system, signage, norms, and laws were used to create a dynamic conceptual design in the urban development. As a result, visual identity, pictograms icons, totems and luminous panels are presented. Luminous system is projected to be linked to rivers height (measured in hydrological gauging stations) to guide users to safe routes. The information technology which can link water height in rivers, to the different levels of flood in the designed system is not among the objectives of this study. Developing strategies to face the potential effects of climate change in the transportation sector poses a major significant challenge. Proper tools are required to prepare to change and provide meaningful environmental, health, social, and security solutions with the quickness the modern cities demand.

Building resilience to mosquito-borne diseases in the Caribbean	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; CLIMATE SERVICES; DENGUE; OUTLOOK; HEALTH	Small island developing states in the Caribbean are among the most vulnerable countries on the planet to climate variability and climate change. In the last 3 decades, the Caribbean region has undergone frequent and intense heat waves, storms, floods, and droughts. This has had a detrimental impact on population health and well-being, including an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. Recent advances in climate science have enhanced our ability to anticipate hydrometeorological hazards and associated public health challenges. Here, we discuss progress towards bridging the gap between climate science and public health decision-making in the Caribbean to build health system resilience to extreme climatic events. We focus on the development of climate services to help manage mosquito-transmitted disease epidemics. There are numerous areas of ongoing biological research aimed at better understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we emphasise additional factors that affect our ability to operationalise this biological understanding. We highlight a lack of financial resources, technical expertise, data sharing, and formalised partnerships between climate and health communities as major limiting factors to developing sustainable climate services for health. Recommendations include investing in integrated climate, health and mosquito surveillance systems, building regional and local human resource capacities, and designing national and regional cross-sectoral policies and national action plans. This will contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and maximising regional development partnerships and co-benefits for improved health and well-being in the Caribbean.

The present study was aimed at finding out the suitability of the integration of fish in this system in waterlogged areas. The experiment consists of three treatments namely SB, silver barb Barbonymus gonionotus; T, tilapia Oreochromis niloticus; and SBT, tilapia: silver barb (1:1 ratio) with three replications of 6.75 m(2) floating vegetable beds in each. Fish were stocked at a rate of 3 m(-2) for five months of culture and fed at 1.5% of body weight twice daily. Over the study period, water quality parameters and fish survival rate did not vary significantly among different treatments. Tilapia showed significantly higher daily and specific growth rates in mono- and polyculture, but silver barb only in polyculture system. Thus, total fish production in kg ha(-1) was significantly higher in treatments T (p = 0.001) and SBT (p = 0.001) than SB. Vegetable production was not significantly different among treatments. In the financial analysis, the benefit-cost ratio of different treatments was >1, indicating that investment was financially profitable for all treatments, but treatment T and SBT were more profitable. Therefore, we can conclude that integrating fish with floating bed agriculture systems could be an ideal approach to generate alternate income activities and mitigate climate change effects among disaster-prone waterlogged regions of Bangladesh.

HEC-HMS models (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System) were developed for five case study watersheds selected to represent a range of scale, soil types, climate, and land cover. Model results indicate that climate change alone could affect peak flood discharges by -6% to +58% a wide range that reflects regional variation in projected rainfall and snowmelt and local watershed conditions. Land cover changes could increase peak flood discharges up to 10% in four of the five watersheds. In those watersheds, the combination of climate and land cover change increase modeled peak flood discharges by up to 66% and runoff volumes by up to 44%. Precipitation projections are a key source of uncertainty, but there is a high likelihood of greater precipitation falling on a more urbanized landscape that produces larger floods. The influence of climate and land cover changes on flood hydrology for the modeled watersheds varies according to future time period, climate scenario, watershed land cover and soil conditions, and flood frequency. The impacts of climate change alone are typically greater than land cover change but there is substantial geographic variation, with urbanization the greater influence on some small, developing watersheds.

J	Sweeney, J				Sweeney, John			Climate and society in modern Ireland: Past and future vulnerabilities	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY SECTION C-ARCHAEOLOGY CELTIC STUDIES HISTORY LINGUISTICS LITERATURE			English	Article							IMPACT	Sitting astride the main storm tracks of the North Atlantic, Ireland's location has historically rendered it vulnerable to the vicissitudes of weather and climate. Throughout the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth century, the imperative of achieving a food, fodder and fuel surplus meant agrarian Irish society was a greater hostage to climate than many other parts of Europe where the Industrial Revolution had enabled the worst effects of the Little Ice Age to be mitigated. Closer examination of society-climate relationships has been facilitated by documentary sources and by direct observations from the nineteenth century onwards, which have provided new insights into Irish climate hazards such as storms, floods and droughts. As Ireland modernised, new concerns such as urban flooding emerged, and new ways of managing climate risks were devised. Ultimately though, as more benign climatic conditions in the mid-nineteenth century gave way to more instability and rapid warming in the twentieth and early twenty first, the need for adaptation and mitigation of climate change became evident. Improvements in global and regional climate modelling and forecasting were instrumental in assisting with this. However, Irish society has been slow to react to climate change concerns and only through a series of catalytic extreme events has public and political attitudes shifted, induced by both 'bottom-up' activism and 'top-down' international agreements. Accordingly, Ireland is now on the threshold of taking the radical steps necessary to shed its 'climate laggard' status and embark on the road to a post carbon society.

It is also a particularly changing landscape with collective hydraulic development actions to enhance rice and vegetable production. The current prevailing climatic change conditions mitigate the drought hazard except at the beginning of the season, and a new flooding risk has arisen.

J	Mkodzongi, G				Mkodzongi, Grasian			The political economy of the climate crisis in Southern Africa	REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Climate crisis; capitalist industrialisation; Southern Africa; carbon emissions; climate justice; Crise climatique; industrialisation capitaliste; Afrique australe; emissions de carbone; justice climatique; Crise climatica; industrializacao capitalista; africa Austral; emissoes de carbono; justica climatica		This article maps out the dynamics of the climate crisis that is unfolding globally, but whose consequences have a disproportionate impact on countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the wider global South. Although these countries have contributed insignificant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (compared to their industrialised counterparts), their populations are the major victims of climate change, whose disastrous impacts were recently witnessed in Zimbabwe during Cyclone Idai and in South Africa during the Durban floods. In addition, Southern Africa is experiencing climate change-induced droughts, depleting water in major dams and undermining hydroelectric power generation, especially in Zambia and Zimbabwe. As a result, the region is experiencing dangerous power outages affecting agriculture and other key industries. This article adopts a novel decolonial perspective to make sense of these extreme weather events, arguing that the climate crisis is already affecting the livelihoods of many people in Southern Africa and that it is often the poor and vulnerable who suffer most from the impacts of climate change. There is thus a need for industrialised countries to contribute towards the costs of climate change mitigation since they are historically responsible for most of the carbon emissions. Cet article decrit les dynamiques de la crise climatique qui se deroule a l'echelle mondiale, mais dont les consequences ont un impact disproportionne sur les pays d'Afrique subsaharienne et du Sud. Bien que ces pays aient contribue de maniere insignifiante aux emissions de gaz a effet de serre (GES) (par rapport a leurs homologues industrialises), leurs populations sont les principales victimes du changement climatique, dont les effets desastreux ont ete recemment constates au Zimbabwe lors du cyclone Idai et en Afrique du Sud lors des inondations de Durban. En outre, la sous-region de l'Afrique australe connait des secheresses induites par le changement climatique, entrainant l'epuisement de l'eau dans les principaux barrages, ce qui compromet la production d'energie hydroelectrique, en particulier en Zambie et au Zimbabwe. En consequence, la region subit des coupures de courant extremes, affectant ainsi l'agriculture et d'autres industries cles. Ces evenements climatiques extremes ont demontre que ce sont souvent les pauvres et les vulnerables qui souffrent le plus de l'impact du changement climatique. Cet article adopte une nouvelle perspective decoloniale pour comprendre l'impact de ces phenomenes meteorologiques extremes sur les communautes vulnerables. L'article affirme que la crise climatique affecte deja les moyens de subsistance d'un grand nombre de personnes dans la sous-region de l'Afrique australe en raison des secheresses, des inondations et des pannes d'electricite. Il est donc necessaire que les pays industrialises contribuent aux couts de l'attenuation du changement climatique, puisqu'ils sont historiquement responsables de la plupart des emissions de carbone. Este artigo mapeia a dinamica da crise climatica que esta a desenrolar-se globalmente, mas cujas consequencias tem um impacto desproporcionado nos paises da africa Subsariana e no sul global em geral. Embora estes paises tenham contribuido com quantidades insignificantes de emissoes de gases com efeito de estufa (GEE) em comparacao com os seus homologos industrializados, as suas populacoes sao as principais vitimas das alteracoes climaticas, cujos impactos desastrosos foram recentemente testemunhados no Zimbabue durante o ciclone Idai e na africa do Sul durante as inundacoes de Durban. Alem do mais, a sub-regiao da africa Austral esta a sofrer secas induzidas pelas alteracoes climaticas, levando ao esgotamento da agua nas principais barragens, prejudicando assim a producao de energia hidroeletrica, especialmente na Zambia e no Zimbabue. Como resultado, a regiao esta a sofrer cortes extremos de energia, afetando a agricultura e outras industrias importantes. Estes fenomenos meteorologicos extremos demonstraram que, muitas vezes, sao os pobres e vulneraveis que mais sofrem com o impacto das alteracoes climaticas. Este artigo adota uma nova perspetiva decolonial para dar sentido a esses eventos climaticos extremos em termos do seu impacto nas comunidades vulneraveis. O artigo argumenta que a crise climatica ja esta a afetar os meios de subsistencia de um grande numero de pessoas na sub-regiao da africa Austral atraves de secas, inundacoes e cortes de energia. e, pois, necessario que os paises industrializados contribuam para os custos da atenuacao das alteracoes climaticas, uma vez que sao historicamente responsaveis pela maior parte das emissoes de carbono.

The usefulness of ecotoxicological tools to improve the assessment of water bodies in a climate change reality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bioassays; Biotic indices; Diatoms; Ecotoxicological classification system; Specific pollution sensitivity index	ECOLOGICAL STATUS; SP.-NOV.; PESTICIDES; QUALITY; BACILLARIOPHYTA; FRAGILARIALES; PHYTOBENTHOS; DIATOMS; SYSTEMS; SURFACE	This study aimed to analyse the added value of using ecotoxicological tools to complement and improve the assessment of natural water bodies status, in situations of climate change, with a higher frequency of extreme events as floods or droughts.Four water bodies of streams in the Guadiana Basin (Alamos, Amieira, Lucefecit, Zebro) were studied in 2017 and 2018 and classified based on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) parameters: Biological Quality Element - Phytobenthos (diatoms), General chemical and physicochemical elements, Specific pollutants, and Priority Substances. Complementarily, bioassays (including lethal and sublethal parameters) were carried out with organisms of different trophic levels: (i) the bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri; (ii) the microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; (iii) the crustaceans Daphnia magna, Thamnocephalus platyurus and Heterocypris incongruens. A classification system with 5 scores was developed, permitting to classify water bodies from non-toxic (EC50 > 100 %; growth and feeding rate > 80 %; blue) to highly toxic (EC50 < 10 %; growth and feeding rate < 10 %; red). The comparison between the classification based on the WFD parameters and on ecotoxicological endpoints showed similar results for 71 % of the samples, and significant positive Pearson correlations were detected between the diatom-based Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI) and EC50V.fisheri, the algae growth rate and Shannon diversity index. These results indicate that when the biological quality elements cannot be used (namely under drought or flooding conditions) the application of ecotoxicological bioassays may be a good alternative. Further, when ecotoxicological parameters were included, an increase of worse classifications (Bad and Poor) was observed, revealing an improvement in the sensitivity of the classification, mainly in presence of specific and priority substances. So, the ecotoxicological analysis appears to provide useful information regarding the potential presence of both known and unknown contaminants at concentrations that cause biological effects (even within the WFD limits), in agreement with several authors that have already suggested its use in biomonitoring.

We performed a 50-month incubation experiment to determine the effect of long-term warming on soil microbes and enzymes involved in carbon cycling along permafrost peatland profile (0-150 cm) and investigated their response to water flooding in the active soil layer. Soil bacteria, fungi, and most enzymes were observed to be sensitive to changes in temperature and water in the permafrost peatland. Bacterial and fungal abundance decreased in the active layer soil but increased in the deepest permafrost layer under warming. The highest decrease in the ratio of soil bacteria to fungi was observed in the deepest permafrost layer under warming. These results indicated that long-term warming promotes recalcitrant carbon loss in permafrost because fungi are more efficient in decomposing high-molecular-weight compounds. Soil microbial catabolic activity measured using Biolog Ecoplates indicated a greater degree of average well color development at 15 degrees C than at 5 degrees C. The highest levels of microbial catabolic activity, functional diversity, and carbon substrate utilization were found in the permafrost boundary layer (60-80 cm). Soil polyphenol oxidase that degrades recalcitrant carbon was more sensitive to increases in temperature than 13-glucosidase, N-acetyl-13-glucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase, which degrade labile carbon. Increasing temperature and water flooding exerted a synergistic effect on the bacterial and fungal abundance and 13-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, and RubisCO activity in the topsoil. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that soil enzyme activity significantly correlated with ratio of soil bacteria to fungi and microbial catabolic activity. Our results provide valuable insights into the linkage response of soil microorganisms, enzymes to climate change and their feedback to permafrost carbon loss.

Intimidating Evidences of Climate Change from the Higher Himalaya: A Case Study from Lahaul, Himachal Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Climate warming; Glacial lake formation and expansion; Forecasting; Lahaul Himalaya; India	GARHWAL HIMALAYA; LAHUL HIMALAYA; GLACIERS; NEPAL; MOVEMENTS; TRENDS; VALLEY; AREAS	Climate change manifestations are no longer shades of grey, but the unprecedented evidences and repercussions are now in black and white. The mounting evidences from the high-mountain areas via accelerated glacier melting, permafrost thaw and expansion of glacier lakes are becoming a major concern for high-mountain communities, environmentalists and policy makers. The accelerated expansion of glacial lakes in the higher Himalaya is not just the expression of glacial melting to climate warming, but poses a serious threat in terms of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The present investigation focuses on a moraine-dammed pro-glacial lake (MDPGL) in the Kadu Nala valley (Lahaul, western Himalaya, India) that has evolved in less than a decade and has been expanding at an alarming rate since 2014. The data show that the actual development of the lake started in 2010 and has expanded to similar to 0.18 km(2) in 2021. The limitation in direct correlations of warming impacting the cryosphere in the higher Himalayan region and hence in the present study is the scarcity of metrological data (especially temperature and precipitation). Therefore, the climate research data (CRU), along with the inferences from tree ring width data, have been used to understand the climatic impacts in this area. Considering that forecasting is a very important aspect of environmental studies, we have used four different forecasting methods to estimate the glacier and glacial lake change scenarios in the present study. The ongoing trends and the model projections of future show accelerated glacier loss and associated glacial lake expansion in Kadu Nala valley and highlight the need for a close monitoring of such lakes, because it has been demonstrated that even the GLOFs from small pro-glacial lakes have the ability to transform into a giant trans-border flood and debris flow. An analogous trend, magnitude and accelerated glacier melting and expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalaya may be attributed to a regionally coherent climate forcing, consistent with atmospheric as well as elevation-dependent warming.

Remote sensing technology has advanced quickly, and it offers effective observation techniques for studying and monitoring glaciers. In order to clarify the stage of research development, research hotspots, research frontiers, and limitations and challenges in glacier mass balance based on remote sensing technology, we used the tools of bibliometrics and data visualization to analyze 4817 works of literature related to glacier mass balance based on remote sensing technology from 1990 to 2021 in the Web of Science database. The results showed that (1) China and the United States are the major countries in the study of glacier mass balance based on remote sensing technology. (2) The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the most productive research institution. (3) Current research hotspots focus on "Climate change", "Inventory", "Dynamics", "Model", "Retreat", "Glacier mass balance", "Sea level", "Radar", "Volume change", "Surface velocity", "Glacier mapping", "Hazard", and other keywords. (4) The current research frontiers include water storage change, artificial intelligence, High Mountain Asia (HMA), photogrammetry, debris cover, geodetic method, area change, glacier volume, classification, satellite gravimetry, grounding line retreat, risk assessment, lake outburst flood, glacier elevation change, digital elevation model, geodetic mass balance, (DEM) generation, etc. According to the results of the visual analysis of the literature, we introduced the three commonly used methods of glacier mass balance based on remote sensing observation and summarized the research status and shortcomings of different methods in glacier mass balance. We considered that the future research trend is to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of data and combine a variety of methods and data to achieve high precision and long-term monitoring of glacier mass changes and improve the consistency of results. This research summarizes the study of glacier mass balance using remote sensing, which will provide valuable information for future research across this field.

J	Xu, YJ; Xu, Z				Xu, Y. J.; Xu, Z.			Carbon dioxide degassing and lateral dissolved carbon export during the unprecedented 2019 Mississippi river mega flood - Implications for large river carbon transport under future climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Continental carbon export; Dissolved carbon fluxes; Riverine CO2 outgassing; Extreme precipitation; Climate change; Mississippi river	ORGANIC-CARBON; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; LAND-USE; WATER; FLUXES; CYCLE; SOIL; FREQUENCY; BASIN; AVAILABILITY	In 2019, the Mississippi River experienced the longest and largest flood that surpassed by far the 1927, 1973, and 2011 mega floods. This unprecedented event provided an unique opportunity to test the hypotheses that summer floods increase not only lateral dissolved carbon transport but also carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing, and that the increase in CO2 outgassing from river surface occurs mainly due to higher terrestrial carbon inputs and warmer temperatures. To test the hypotheses, we conducted intensive river sampling and in-situ measurements on partial pressure of CO2 (rho CO2) and other water physical, chemical and biological parameters in 6-day intervals throughout the entire flood period (January 6th to August 5th, 2019). Water samples were analyzed for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and their carbon-13 isotopes. Compared to reported average rho CO2 measured at the same place from the recent past (1500 mu atm +/- 743), we found significantly elevated rho CO2 in the river water during the flood period (2217 mu atm +/- 805; max = 3359 mu atm), which was positively correlated with water temperature (rho = 0.83). During the flood with sustained high rho CO2, the lower Mississippi River released 230 Gg C from its last 357-km river reach, which is 18 % greater than the annual CO2 emission (195 Gg C) reported for 2016-2018. A total of 3.73 Tg C DOC and 14.14 Tg C DIC was laterally transported into the Gulf of Mexico during the flood period, which were close to or greater than the previously reported annual averages. The findings support the initial hypotheses and strongly suggest that future climate change will intensify carbon cycling in world's rivers. Our study adds firsthand results on land-sea carbon transport from by far the largest Mississippi River flood and helps constrain uncertainties in carbon budgeting of global rivers.	[Xu, Y.

In this study, we examine the hydro-climatic variation of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin in the Tibet Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by combining delta O-18 proxy records in Indian and Omani caves with the simulated Indian summer monsoon, surface temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff via the Community Climate System Model and the reconstructed glacier coverage via the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. The mean river runoff was kept at a low level of 145 billion cubic meters per year until an abrupt increase at a rate of 8.7 million cubic meters per year in the Bolling-Allerod interval (BA). The annual runoff reached a maximum of 250 billion cubic meters in the early Holocene and then reduced to the current value of 180 billion cubic meters at a rate of 6.4 million cubic meters per year. The low runoff in the LGM and Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) is likely attributed to such a small contribution of precipitation to runoff and the large glacier cover. The percentage of precipitation to runoff was only 20% during the LGM and HS1. Comparison of glacier area among different periods indicates that the fastest deglaciation occurred during the late HS1, when nearly 60% of glacier area disappeared in the middle reach, 50% in the upper reach, and 30% in the lower reach. The rapid deglaciation and increasing runoff between the late HS1 and BA may have accelerated widespread ice-dam breaches and led to extreme outburst flood events. Combining local geological proxy records and regional simulations could be a useful approach for the study of paleo-hydrologic variations in big river basins.

Part I: Analysis with the CMIP6 Historical Dataset	WATER			English	Article						extreme climate indices; spatiotemporal variability; innovative trend analysis; Mann-Kendall; Sen's slope	INNOVATIVE TREND ANALYSIS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MONITORING CHANGES; VARIABILITY; EXTREMES; RAINFALL; BASIN; WATER; AGRICULTURE	Climate variability and change constitute major challenges for Africa, especially West Africa (WA), where an important increase in extreme climate events has been noticed. Therefore, it appears essential to analyze characteristics and trends of some key climatological parameters. Thus, this study addressed spatiotemporal variabilities and trends in regard to temperature and precipitation extremes by using 21 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6) and 24 extreme indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). First, the CMIP6 variables were evaluated with observations (CHIRPS, CHIRTS, and CRU) of the period 1983-2014; then, the extreme indices from 1950 to 2014 were computed. The innovative trend analysis (ITA), Sen's slope, and Mann-Kendall tests were utilized to track down trends in the computed extreme climate indices. Increasing trends were observed for the maxima of daily maximum temperature (TXX) and daily minimum temperature (TXN) as well as the maximum and minimum of the minimum temperature (TNX and TNN). This upward trend of daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and daily minimum temperature (Tmin) was enhanced with a significant increase in warm days/nights (TX90p/TN90p) and a significantly decreasing trend in cool days/nights (TX10p/TN10p). The precipitation was widely variable over WA, with more than 85% of the total annual water in the study domain collected during the monsoon period. An upward trend in consecutive dry days (CDD) and a downward trend in consecutive wet days (CWD) influenced the annual total precipitation on wet days (PRCPTOT). The results also depicted an upward trend in SDII and R30mm, which, additionally to the trends of CDD and CWD, could be responsible for localized flood-like situations along the coastal areas. The study identified the 1970s dryness as well as the slight recovery of the 1990s, which it indicated occurred in 1992 over West Africa.

Landscape Variables Influence over Active Restoration Strategies of <i>Nothofagus</i> Forests Degraded by Invasive <i>Castor canadensis</i> in Tierra del Fuego	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Patagonia; plantation; invasive species; species substitution; climate change	PUMILIO SEEDLINGS; BEAVER INVASION; REGENERATION; DYNAMICS; SUCCESSION; PLASTICITY; STREAMS; IMPACT; LIGHT	North American beavers (Castor canadensis) are responsible for the major changes in the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, altering riparian forests for the long-term. Passive restoration of the areas affected was ineffective in the medium-term (up to 20 years), being necessary active strategies. Plantations in abandoned ponds were made with Nothofagus pumilio and N. antarctica tree species across Tierra del Fuego island (Argentina). In the first experiment, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors in three micro-habitats in the impacted areas: front and tail of ponds, and cut not-flooded forest areas. Five-years-old N. pumilio seedlings had 39% survival in front, 21% in tails, and 46% in cut areas at year-3 of the restoration experiments, being negatively influenced by plant cover and soil moisture. Lower growth was recorded during year-1 (0.7-0.9 cm yr(-1)), but increased on time (1.9 cm yr(-1) front, 1.6 cm yr(-1) tail, 4.3 cm yr(-1) cut areas). A second experiment explores the alternative to substitute the tree species to face the harder conditions of the impact and climate change. For this, we conducted a new plantation at four locations across the main bioclimatic zones, where 10-40 cm N. antarctica plants attained 17% survival in meadows (front and tail) and 30% in cut areas, being higher with larger than smaller plants (25% vs. 18%), and where they are mainly influenced by rainfall (4% in sites 400 mm yr(-1)). The main damage was detected in the above-ground biomass due to dryness, but root survival allowed the emergence of new shoots in the following growing season. It is necessary to monitor different Nothofagus species across natural environments in the landscape to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of different strategies in restoration plans, considering the selection of climate-resilient tree species.

Here, we use high-resolution lacustrine grain-size and geochemical records from Lake Issyk-Kul to infer hydrological changes, environmental events, and their driving factors in the western Tianshan Mountains of Central Asia over the last 350 years. The regional hydrological and environmental changes can be divided into three phases. In stage I (1674-1860 AD), the values of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and magnetic susceptibility (MS) were high, and the element contents changed indistinctively, suggesting that lake water levels were relatively stable. In Stage II (1860-2000 AD), the TOC and TN contents increased, the MS values decreased, and the grain size changed markedly, suggesting that water levels fluctuated dramatically. In Stage III (2000-2013 AD), the coarse particle and migratory element contents increased dramatically, indicating that regional rainfall and runoff increased and that the water level rose. Studies have also shown that the synchronous increases in sedimentary coarse particles, TOC and migratory elements indicate multiple flood events. Extreme floods have been frequent and intense in recent years, which indicates that the climate is generally warming, which is in good agreement with tree ring data, ice core records and other sediment records in alpine regions. Additionally, the lake sediments recorded a seismic event in approximately 1910 AD, which was consistent with historical documentation. Comparative analysis of records suggests that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is one of the dominant factors driving climate and hydrological changes in the study area. Climate change, combined with natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and anthropogenic activities, is generating extreme floods and variations in hydrological patterns in the mountain basin. These findings can provide crucial information about sedimentary physicochemical clues for tracking past hydrological and environmental conditions and contribute to a better understanding of hydrological processes and driving factors in the mountainous areas of Central Asia.

Coastal river deltas provide multiple ecosystem services. Many deltas serve as major centers of agriculture, industry and commerce. The annual economic benefits derived from major deltas are often a substantial fraction of a country?s GDP. Yet, many deltas are losing land due to erosion, subsidence and subsequent flooding. Such vulnerabilities are often increased due to local land and water management decisions, relative sea-level rise, and increases in climate extremes. Aim of this review. Considerable literature exists addressing the formation of deltas and the effects of increasing urbanization, industrialization and crop and fish production, increases in relative sea level rise, and decreasing sediment deposition. This leads to the question: are the economic, environmental, ecological and social benefits derived from developed river deltas sustainable?This review focuses on this question. Methods/Design. Over 180 published documents were identified and reviewed using various search engines and key words. These key words included river deltas; delta sustainability, vulnerability, resilience, coasts, ecology, hazards, erosion, water management, urbanization, reclamation, agriculture, governance, pollution, geomorphology, economic development, socio-economic changes, and delta wetlands; relative sea level change; sediment trapping; sand mining; salinity intrusion; coastal restoration; estuarine engineering; shoreline evolution; estuarine processes; and the names of specific river basin deltas. Review Results/Synthesis and Discussion. Deltas provide humans important resources and ecosystem services leading to their intensive development. The impacts of this development, together with sea-level rise, threatens the sustainability of many river deltas. Various management and governance measures are available to help sustain deltas. Controls on land use, improved farming and transport technology, wetland habitat protection, and d improved governance are some that might help sustain the economic and ecological services provided by deltas. However, increased population growth and the impacts of climate change will put increased pressure on deltas and the benefits derived from them.

As a result of climate change, glacial lakes have expanded continually in ST over recent five decades, and ST is seriously suffering from glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Hence, glacial lake investigations and hazard assessments of GLOFs are very necessary to perform and are of great practical significance for this area. The region running from Ranwu to Tongmai (RTR) in ST was selected as a study area. To assess hazard degrees of GLOFs, nine factors (F1-F9) were selected from glacial characteristics: the scale of glacial lakes, meteorological conditions, moraine dam parameters and downstream gullies. Average monthly (May to September) land surface temperatures (LSTs), temperature change rates, and average annual precipitation levels were first calculated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data. Then, glacial lake areas, downstream gully slopes, distances to glacial lakes, upper glacier areas, average gradients of upper glaciers, and terminal moraine dam widths were obtained based on Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Finally, the fuzzy comprehensive assessment (FCA) method was used to assess hazard degrees of GLOFs in the study area. According to the results, 135 glacial lakes existed during the study periods, five new glacial lakes formed due to lake collapse and snow and ice melt, and one disappeared due to GLOFs. The number of glacial lakes in the area increased from 130 in 1986 to 134 in 2015, and the total area of glacial lakes increased from 832.77 ha in 1986 to 850.51 ha in 2015 due to lake expansion and GLOFs. Of the 134 glacial lakes present in 2015, 10 are identified as high hazardous lakes, eight are identified as medium hazardous lakes, two are considered low hazardous lakes, and 114 are considered extremely low hazardous lakes. The results illustrate hazard levels of GLOFs in ST, which can help guide future hazard prevention in the area.

Vinod			Rock-Ice avalanche induced flash floods - Beginning of a new normal in Indian Himalayan Region	HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY			English	Article						Permafrost; Rock avalanche; debris flow; Satellite data; GLOF; Cloud burst	DEVI BIOSPHERE RESERVE; LANDSLIDE	Climate change and atmospheric warming have already shown their effect on the Earth's cryosphere. In the year 2021, the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), especially the permafrost areas, witnessed few massive mass wasting phenomena which were previously unseen. On 29 October 2021, a large debris flow was observed in the upper reaches of the Kameng River in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh. The mud-laden water was carried by the Warriangbung River, a tributary to the Kameng River. This event was triggered due to a rock avalanche in the glaciated region from which the river originates. This event has a remarkable similarity to the event of 07 February 2021, wherein a massive rock and ice avalanche was triggered from the Raunthi Peak, upstream of the Rishiganga River in the NW Himalayas that caused a severe flash flood in downstream areas, resulting in significant loss of human lives and infrastructures. In this study, we correlate these two events in the NE and NW Himalayas. We have attempted to understand climatic conditions leading up to the event, the morphology of the slope and the underlying geological/structural controls, thus drawing similarities between the two events though located wide apart. We demonstrated through the comparative analysis and deductions drawn that the effects of warming and climate change are visible even in the higher reaches of the IHR. Events like Kameng and Rishiganga are now a reality and may repeat in the near future.	[Martha, Tapas R.; Roy, Priyom; Jain, Nirmala; Kumar, K.

In Southern Brazil, rice is traditionally produced with continuous irrigation, implying a significant amount of water used. Besides, continuous flooding favors the uptake of toxic elements such as arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd). In this work, one Brazilian rice cultivar (IRGA 424) was tested for the effects of elevated CO2 concentration and different water regimes on rice yield, and As and Cd accumulation in grain. (2) Methods: Rice was grown in two CO2 concentrations (400 and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) and two irrigation regimes (continuous and intermittent). It was evaluated the number of tillers, plant height, aboveground dry weight (ADW), water use efficiency (WUE), rice yield components, and As and Cd concentration in rice grain. (3) Results: Rice plants were taller and had a higher WUE when cultivated at e[CO2]. The ADW and the rice yield component were not affected by CO2 levels nor water regimes. Intermittent flood regimes had a lower average As concentration. The Cd concentration in the samples in both growing seasons and all treatments was below the limit of quantitation (8.76 mu g kg(-1)). (4) Conclusions: Enhanced CO2 concentration did not affect rice yield, increased the WUE, and reduced As concentration in grains. Regarding water management, the intermittent regime enhanced WUE and promoted a reduction in As concentration in grains.

Based on observed meteorological data, outputs of 20 global climate models and drought disaster data, future climate change and relevant drought hazard in the twenty-first century were projected in Ningxia, with the scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP4.5; the risks of people, crop, and agriculture economy to drought disasters are quantitatively assessed, with the application of physical vulnerability curve models, probability distribution functions and Monte Carlo simulation method. It is found that the climate in Ningxia is likely to have a warming and wetting tendency in the twenty-first century. The extent of drought hazard is likely to increase. The increase rate is greater under RCP4.5 than that under RCP2.6. In general, the risks of population, crop, and agriculture to drought disasters are likely to increase in Ningxia in the twenty-first century. The magnitude of increase is likely to reach the greatest in the immediate term (2016-2035), followed by the increase in the medium term (2046-2065), and the long term (2081-2100). In comparison with RCP2.6, the drought disaster risks under the scenario of RCP4.5 are likely to increase further in three periods of the twenty-first century. The findings of this work have potential to provide data support for drought disaster risk management and support risk-based decision-making.

J	Boretti, A				Boretti, Alberto			Analysis of the 160 years' time series of daily rainfall in Brisbane	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING			English	Article						Australia; droughts; floods; natural variability; rainfall	CLIMATE-CHANGE; OSCILLATION	The composite time series of daily rainfall for Brisbane from 1860 to 2022 shows evidence of natural oscillations and the absence of any growing or reducing trend. The linear trend has a slope of only -2 mu m/year, which is statistically insignificant. Similarly insignificant is the acceleration, calculated as double the 2nd order coefficient of the parabolic trend, at +0.02 mu m/year(2). Higher than February 2022 single-day rainfall, three-day consecutive rainfall, or single-month rainfall, were measured in the past. The natural oscillations have, amongst others, clear inter-annual, decadal, and multi-decadal cycles, of lengths slightly less than 10, about 20, about 40, and 65-80 years (quasi-60 years). We conclude that the climate for south-eastern Queensland is characterised by a fairly stable rainfall pattern, dominated by wet and dry cycles.

J	Li, P; Sheng, MY; Yang, DW; Tang, LH				Li, Ping; Sheng, Mingyang; Yang, Dawen; Tang, Lihua			Evaluating flood regulation ecosystem services under climate, vegetation and reservoir influences	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Flood; Ecosystem services; CLM-GBHM; Climate; Vegetation	YELLOW-RIVER BASIN; SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND; LOESS PLATEAU; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; CHINA; MODEL; AFFORESTATION; PROJECTIONS	Flood regulation is one of the critical ecosystem services that people acquire from ecosystems. With climate change and variability and land use/land management, ecosystem services have changed globally. Some ecological restoration activities, such as the Grain for Green program (GGP) implemented in the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China, greatly change the flow patterns and affect the flood regulation services provided by ecosystems. Many studies have assessed the peak flow trends in the YRB; however, quantitatively evaluating flood regulation services while also considering the effects of climate, vegetation and dam construction is rare. In this study, the annual flood regulation index (FRI) was calculated from 1958 to 2014 for nine watersheds in the YRB using an index-based ecosystem service approach. Based on the community land model coupled with the geomorphology-based hydrological model (CLM-GBHM) established in the YRB, the annual FRI under two vegetation scenarios, i.e., (1) static leaf area index (LAI) in 1982 and (2) remotely sensed LAI from 1982 to 2014, was calculated. The effects of changes in climate and vegetation on the flood regulation services were then assessed. The Impacts of reservoirs were also discussed based on the FRI calculated using observed data. The results indicate that the annual FRI generally improved in most areas of the YRB over a 57-year period. The annual FRI significantly increased in the upper YRB while being stabilized in the headwater basin, primarily benefitting from the regulations by the Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs. When climate change was considered as a single influencing factor, the flood regulation services were negatively affected by extreme precipitation. Impacted by the increased total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) and the average rainfall intensity (SDII) in the flood season, the mean annual FRI significantly declined by 6.3%-33.8% among the studied watersheds during 2000-2014 compared to those from 1980 to 1999. Positively impacted by the vegetation restoration after the GGP was implemented in 1999, the mean annual FRI increased 8.6% in the regions above Lanzhou station and 1.6%-5.5% in the five tributaries during 2000-2014. Our results suggest that the negative influences of the FRI from extreme precipitation should be considered under climate change, while improving the flood regulation ecosystem services through implementing vegetation restoration programmes can enhance flood risk management in other river basins.

The dependence of the Kinneret WL management on climate change (flood-dryness alternate), dam and National Water Carrier (NWC) constructions constrained by water availability and domestic supply demands were indicated. A short-term range of maximal WL decline of 4-6 m and 4.6-6.5% of the total surface area of lake water shrinkage in Lake Kinneret was documented. Nevertheless, incomparably longer periods and higher amplitudes of WL decline accompanied by a dramatic shrinking of the water surface were documented in Lake Tchad, the Aral Sea and Lake Sivan (SAT). Therefore, the comparative results of WL decline in Lake Kinneret and in other lakes as SAT are not justified.

The team learnt how to construct simple dams, known in India as `johads', that harvest seasonal rainfall, reducing flood and drought risk. They then built a new dam and restored another in Rajasthan district, recording the process to enable others to replicate the work. A language-neutral educational film was then produced and tested with other communities in India and Colombia to ensure applicability to a variety of geographies, cultures and environments. Educating communities on water management in this way will help to achieve the United Nations sustainable development goal 6: clean water and sanitation for all.

Nevertheless, they are threatened by climate change in terms of opposite weather extremes, such as heavy rainfalls and long-lasting droughts. In response, rainwater harvesting systems have emerged as valuable solutions for managing water resources and controlling related problems. Of primary importance is the identification of suitable sites for installation. However, a systematic selection procedure still needs to be explored; it is necessary for morphologically complex vineyards that include historical features of significant cultural value (such as terraced systems). To fill this gap, this study employed a high-resolution overflow simulation model that combines a set of criteria to identify the optimal network of water harvesting structures (also drawing on traditional knowledge) and quantify the potential for water storage during rainfall of varying intensities. The study area considered is located within the "Soave Traditional Vineyards" (north of Italy) site, a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) recognized by FAO. The surface overflow was simulated considering two key rainstorms that occurred in the last few years at different time intervals. 53 potential sites for water harvesting were selected according to field survey, runoff simulation, and topographic analysis. The results indicate that the water potentially collected from designed sites could have a double function: (1) mitigate the surface overflow that can potentially cause downslope terrace collapse or even flooding villages; (2) provide irrigation water for vineyards during water scarcity scenarios. The spatial distribution of the water collected could undoubtedly guide sustainable decisions in steep-slope viticultural systems under climate change forcing.

The Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with return intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years were estimated for a 3 h duration of rainfall using the Gumbel statistical method to assess urban flooding extent around the Baganbari slum within the Baunia Khal watershed. The spatial land use changes of the Baunia Khal were also delineated through the analysis of the areal changes of the khal from 2004 to 2020. The area of the khal was found to be 7.00 km(2), 2.17 km(2) and 0.41 km(2) for the years 2004, 2010, and 2020, respectively. It appears that a gradual massive areal decrease of the khal (impervious land segment) was in progress during this period for high encroachments driven by various governmental agencies and other private entities' urban developmental projects. The runoff coefficient was computed as 0.76 based on the existing land use pattern, slope, and soil type of the study area. The average runoff generated from the catchment was estimated using the rational method and was 103.41 m(3)/hr. The drainage length was calculated as 9.1 km using the Kirpich method, whereas the present drainage length was reported as only 6.95 km. The multiple rainfall intensities with return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years were also applied to replicate a heightened extent of urban flooding in the Baunia Khal watershed. The study suggests that the depth, length and width of the Baunia Khal need to increase to hold the generated runoff to manage urban flooding around the Baunia Khal watershed.

J	Blanchet, J; Creutin, JD				Blanchet, Juliette; Creutin, Jean-Dominique			Instrumental agreement and retrospective analysis of trends in precipitation extremes in the French Mediterranean Region	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme precipitation; trend; French Mediterranean Region; rain-gauge	FLASH-FLOOD; SOUTHERN FRANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EMERGENCE; TIME; RAINFALL; EVOLUTION; EVENTS	In this letter we show the emergence of an agreement between the instruments of a rain-gauge network to point toward a positive trend in daily precipitation extremes since 1960 in the French Mediterranean Region. We identify for each gauge the time varying parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution of annual maximum precipitation over incremental time-windows. These distributions provide for each station of the network a trend assessment over a chosen period that can be interpreted for instance as a trend of the mean or as the trend of a chosen quantile. The incremental window, i.e. a window containing the series of data available at a given date, mimics the annual assessment of the trends that could have been made through time. Each year we thus have one trend per gauge that we can look in distribution through the network in order to assess the level of consensus among instruments. We show how the increasing size of the datasets used over a period of possible climate non-stationarity progressively leads from a dissensus anarchically pointing to no trend (before the 2000s) to a consensus where a majority of gauges points toward a positive trend (after the 2000s). The detected trend in this Mediterranean Region is quite substantial. For instance the 20 year return period precipitation in 1960 turns out to become a 8 year return period precipitation in 2020. Using a simulation basis we try to characterize the effect of decadal variability that is quite readable in the consensus evolution. The proposed metrics is thought to be a good candidate for the assessment of the local time and rate of emergence of climate change that has important implications in regards to adaptation of human and natural systems.

In addition, the delicate balance of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff affects the variations in soil moisture, which is of vital importance to agriculture. A systematic examination of climate change impacts on these variables may help provide scientific foundations for the design of relevant adaptation and mitigation measures. In this study, long-term variations in the water cycle over China are explored using the Regional Climate Model system (RegCM) developed by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. Model performance is validated through comparing the simulation results with remote sensing data and gridded observations. The results show that RegCM can reasonably capture the spatial and seasonal variations in three dominant variables for the water cycle (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff). Long-term projections of these three variables are developed by driving RegCM with boundary conditions of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The results show that increased annual average precipitation and evapotranspiration can be found in most parts of the domain, while a smaller part of the domain is projected with increased runoff. Statistically significant increasing trends (at a significant level of 0.05) can be detected for annual precipitation and evapotranspiration, which are 0.02 and 0.01 mm/day per decade, respectively, under RCP4.5 and are both 0.03 mm/day per decade under RCP8.5. There is no significant trend in future annual runoff anomalies. The variations in the three variables mainly occur in the wet season, in which precipitation and evapotranspiration increase and runoff decreases. The projected changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration are larger than those in runoff, implying a possible decrease in soil moisture.

Climate vulnerability scenario of the agricultural sector in the Bicol River Basin, Philippines	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Agriculture; Climate Change; Vulnerability; Rural livelihood; Bicol River basin; Philippines	ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ADAPTATION; INDICATORS; INSIGHTS; IMPACTS; POVERTY; SOILS	This paper investigated the vulnerability of the agriculture sector and rural agriculture livelihoods in the Bicol River Basin (BRB) of the Philippines to projected changes in climate. The geographical characteristics of the BRB feature eight major sub-basins or watersheds consisting of Libmanan-Pulantuna, Ragay Hills, Thiris, Naga-Yabo, Pawili River, Waras-Lalo, Naporog, and Quinali. The study applied the combination of the participatory tools and the Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) framework to gather information on local climate vulnerabilities and contexts. Briefly, the CRVA employed geospatial modeling and utilized several indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity which were aggregated to provide an index of vulnerability. This enabled us to identify areas of exposure and vulnerability and pointed areas of greatest need for strengthened adaptive capacity and risk management. Our findings revealed that vulnerability in the BRB was perceived to be relatively prevalent and that typhoons, flooding, and drought were identified to contribute significant impacts to rural livelihood. Furthermore, our findings in the CRVA suggested significant regional differences in vulnerability in the BRB. The majority of the towns in the central and northwestern portions of the BRB will largely experience increased vulnerability, particularly, in the Thiris sub-basin including some parts of Ragay Hills, Waras-Lalo, and the northwestern Libmanan-Pulantuna sub-basins. On the contrary, the entire Quinali region on the south is revealed to have the lowest vulnerability index. The clear policy implication of these accounts will be on how to mobilize developmental thrusts in both areas of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the sub-national level to reinforce local-based climate priority setting in adaptation interventions and policies.

A 1400-years flood frequency reconstruction for the Basque country (N Spain): Integrating geological, historical and instrumental datasets	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Paleofloods; Lake; Historical floods; Late Holocene; Multi-archive integration	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; CENTRAL PYRENEES; LAST MILLENNIUM; IBERIAN RANGE; HUMAN IMPACT; RECORD; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; SENSITIVITY	We present the first reconstruction of past flood events variability in the Basque Country and Western Ebro Basin (Northern Spain) integrating instrumental hydrological datasets (last 20 years), documentary archives (last 700 years) and Lake Arreo (655 m a.s.l.) sedimentary paleoflood record (last 1400 years). In this lake, allochthonous coarse and fine detrital layers (CDL and FDL respectively) intercalated within endogenic laminites were identified and interpreted as high-and moderate-energy flood events. The interplay between human activities and hydroclimate variability has controlled the deposition of these flood layers. Gauged data for the last 20 years suggest that floods are typically generated by heavy rainfall events on saturated soils after several days of continuous rainfall. These events occur mostly during the cold season (Oct-May). The reconstructed frequency of high-magnitude flood events from the lake record is coherent with the historical cold-season floods from Basque rivers. The lowest flood frequency took place during the 6-7th and 10-15th centuries, while higher flood frequency occurred during the 8-9th centuries and the last 500 years. Fluvial and lacustrine paleoflood records and documentary evidence show abrupt and large increases in extreme flood frequency during the termination of the Little Ice Age (1830-1870 CE) and mid to late 20th century, both periods of Rapid Climate Change (RCC). The significant increase in flood frequency observed during RCC suggests that a similar pattern could be expected in the near future with the ongoing global warming. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Along with the dramatic changes of water related disasters such as flood and drought, local society developed various strategies to cope with the water problems. This paper investigated the evolution of the Poyang Lake area, the flood and drought disasters, and the society resilience using statistical analysis, spatial analysis, and a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Historical data on climate, population, flood and drought, water engineering, and social economics were collected to support a detailed examination of the climate-hazard-society relationships. The results indicate that: (a) the lake area was mainly influenced by the warm and rainy climate and expanded significantly before the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 AD). Since the large-scale southward population migration in the Yuan Dynasty, intensive reclamation of wetlands surrounding the lake plus the effects of a colder climate shrank the lake area sharply. (b) The frequency of water-related disasters was gradually increasing during the past 2000 years, especially since 12th century, as a result of climate change and population growth. (c) Despite significant change in climate and increasing flood and drought, local people in Poyang Lake area adopted various water engineering to prevent flood and coast training measures to protect farmland, which enabled the social surviving and continuous economic development. Social resilience in Poyang Lake was highly correlated with lake changes and associated water hazards. (d) Presently, more ecological strategies have been adopted to mitigate the risk of flood and drought at the Poyang Lake area. The study emphasizes the influences of climate and water environment and the coping activities of human society, and thus contributes to a specific understanding of resilient living with big lakes.

Cascading Hazards in the Aftermath of Australia's 2019/2020 Black Summer Wildfires	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							EROSION	Following an unprecedented drought, Australia's 2019/2020 "Black Summer" fire season caused severe damage, gravely impacting both humans and ecosystems, and increasing susceptibility to other hazards. Heavy precipitation in early 2020 led to flooding and runoff that entrained ash and soil in burned areas, increasing sediment concentration in rivers, and reducing water quality. We exemplify this hazard cascade in a catchment in New South Wales by mapping burn severity, flood, and rainfall recurrence; estimating changes in soil erosion; and comparing them with river turbidity data. We show that following the extreme drought and wildfires, even moderate rain and floods led to undue increases in soil erosion and reductions in water quality. While natural risk analysis and planning commonly focuses on a single hazard, we emphasize the need to consider the entire hazard cascade, and highlight the impacts of ongoing climate change beyond its direct effect on wildfires. Plain Language Summary In 2019/2020, a chain of natural hazards impacted Australia's East Coast. Following the severest drought since weather records began, record-breaking wildfires known as the "Black Summer" ravaged the region for months. In early 2020, the rainfall that extinguished the last of these fires caused further damage, as the burned soils repelled much of the rain. Water took the exposed soil and charred vegetation with it on its way to the rivers, flooding streets and polluting drinking water. We show an example of this cascade of hazards in a single river catchment. We found that after the wildfires, even moderate rainfall caused floods, increased soil erosion, and reduced water quality drastically. Natural risk analyses mostly focus on single types of events in isolation. However, this hazard cascade shows that, especially in the face of ongoing climate change, scientists and decision makers need to consider events not just by themselves, but connected with each other.

Very little is known about this type of water bodies, in contrast to oxbow lakes or old river beds. The study examines the spatial horizontal distribution of HM and the effect of texture, organic carbon (OC) content, morphometric and location features on HM concentrations. Moreover, the data from the assessment of sediment toxicity were analysed with respect to recent years' droughts to estimate the potential toxicity of sediments as soils. The statistical analyses showed that the texture and the OC content had a significant impact on the HM concentrations. Fine-grained and OC-rich sediments exhibited higher HM pollution. Only one morphometric/location factor was shown to affect HM levels in sediments - the angle between the reservoir axis and the riverbed. The angle value affected the texture and, consequently, the HM content: with a rising angle the share of the coarse-grained fraction increased leading to a decrease in the HM concentration. The spatial horizontal HM distribution did not show statistically significant results, nonetheless, HM content was found to rise along with the distance from the initial part of reservoir. The toxicity levels were not exceeded in sediments, however, the evaluation of the material as soil showed that, according to European Union guidelines, the content of at least one HM was toxic in 80% of the samples. Contaminated floodplain reservoirs should be regarded as a double threat to riverine ecosystems. On the one hand, they are one of the main non-point sources of river valley pollution; on the other hand, given the drying up of reservoirs, sediments become soils and the soil-bound heavy metals become more toxic to the environment.

J	Khodayar, S; Hoerner, J				Khodayar, Samiro; Hoerner, Johannes			An idealized model sensitivity study on Dead Sea desertification with a focus on the impact on convection	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; EVAPORATION; TRANSPORT; ISRAEL	The Dead Sea desertification-threatened region is affected by continual lake level decline and occasional but life-endangering flash floods. Climate change has aggravated such issues in the past decades. In this study, the impact on local conditions leading to heavy precipitation from the changing conditions of the Dead Sea is investigated. Idealized sensitivity simulations with the high-resolution COSMO-CLM (COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling and Climate Limited-area Modelling) and several numerical weather prediction (NWP) runs on an event timescale are performed on the Dead Sea area. The simulations are idealized in the sense that the Dead Sea model representation does not accurately represent the real conditions but those given by an external dataset. A reference or Dead Sea simulation covering the 2003-2013 period and a twin sensitivity or bare soil simulation in which the Dead Sea is set to bare soil are compared. NWP simulations focus on heavy precipitation events exhibiting relevant differences between the Dead Sea and the bare soil decadal realization to assess the impact on the underlying convection-related processes. The change in the conditions of the Dead Sea is seen to affect the atmospheric conditions leading to convection in two ways. (a) The local decrease in evaporation reduces moisture availability in the lower boundary layer locally and in the neighbouring regions, directly affecting atmospheric stability. Weaker updraughts characterize the drier and more stable atmosphere of the simulations in which the Dead Sea has been dried out. (b) Thermally driven wind system circulations and resulting divergence/convergence fields are altered, preventing in many occasions the initiation of convection because of the omission of convergence lines. On a decadal scale, the difference between the simulations suggests a weak decrease in evaporation, higher air temperatures and less precipitation (less than 0.5 %).

Nonclimatic flood risk factors are considered and used to develop a base for flood potential prior to investigating the potential impacts due to climate change, which is mapped within Currituck County, North Carolina, using a multivariate logistic regression. Several site characteristics (elevation, slope, curvature, land cover, impervious surface, distance to water, tree density, surficial materials, and soil drainage) were identified as potential flood risk factors and divided into classes. An attempt was made to correlate these flood risk factors to the spatial extent of the FEMA 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Site characteristics of an equal number of locations (similar to 43,000) from within and outside of the SFHA were used to train the statistical model. Logistic regression was then used to estimate coefficients for each class of each flood risk factor. It was found that elevation, land slope, and soil drainage class have the greatest correlation to flood inundation in the county. The coefficients were then used to create a logistic regression equation from which probabilities of flooding were estimated for the entire county at a 30-m resolution. Large areas of the central portion of the county and the northern Outer Banks were classified as very high risk (80%-100%) and high risk (60%-80%). While all other high-risk areas corresponded to areas already located within the SFHA, the Outer Banks encompassed areas that are not included in the SFHA. Critical infrastructure related to basic human needs, such as education, safety, and health, located in this high-risk area warrant additional attention regarding potential flood mitigation efforts.

Ecosystem management tools to study natural habitats as wave damping structures and coastal protection mechanisms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Coastal management; Coral reefs; Bottom friction; Numerical modeling	CARIBBEAN CORAL-REEFS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MASS-TRANSFER; FLOW; DISSIPATION; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; SWASH; TRANSFORMATION	Tropical countries have island and continental ecosystems of great value for tourism, fisheries and also for their conservation development potential. These natural habitats, including among other beaches, seagrass beds, mangrove forests and coral reefs can dissipate wave energy acting as barriers against high waves and high water levels to eventually protect coastal infrastructure and communities. However, in recent decades, they have been subject to strong anthropic pressure and extreme events due to natural causes as well as to climate change. Therefore, the global trend is to understand the eco-systemic services that these natural environments can provide and their economic value in terms of reducing damages caused by coastal erosion and flooding. A methodological framework is presented in order to quantify the impact of natural ecosystems in coastal protection and their environmental assessment based on numerical models available in the literature. In addition to the methodology, a study of a typical Caribbean fringing coral reef and its response to different sea level rise and extreme events scenarios was conducted. The contribution of these efforts from a technological and scientific point of view, lies in the integration of different disciplines required to combine the physical properties of hydrodynamic studies with biological factors as an input to provide practical socio-economic and environmental solutions in those regions in which these ecosystems predominate. Furthermore, a numerical modeling tool to study wave energy dissipation, focusing the analysis on the impact of natural ecosystems (coral reefs) on coastal erosion and flooding was implemented. This information will help coastal managers and decision-makers understand the coastal protection services provided by nearshore habitats in order to improve and design new coastal development strategies under global change scenarios.

J	Miranda, FN; Ferreira, TM				Miranda, Fabiana Navia; Ferreira, Tiago Miguel			A simplified approach for flood vulnerability assessment of historic sites	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood vulnerability assessment; Exposure; Sensitivity; Historic sites; Historic centre of GuimarAes	RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN COMMUNITIES; HAZARDS; BUILDINGS	In the last decades, floods have increased in frequency all over the world due to diverse phenomena such as climate change, extended urbanization, land use, etc. Their social, cultural, economic and environmental impacts have also grown significantly, highlighting the need for the development of further studies and improved methods to manage and mitigate flood risk, mainly in urban areas. Historic sites need particular attention in this field, not only because the high and irreplaceable cultural value of these areas, but also taking into account that the constructive typologies that they host are particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. In consequence of that, the analysis of the phenomena, the evaluation of their consequences and the adoption of adequate mitigation and preparedness measures are presently a fundamental societal challenge. Having this in mind, the present paper aims at proposing an innovative methodology focused on the assessment of flood vulnerability in historic sites through the evaluation of a set of exposure and sensitivity indicators. From the analysis of these indicators, it is possible to obtain a Flood Vulnerability Index capable of measuring the spread of flood vulnerability over an extended area. The historic centre of GuimarAes, in Portugal, declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2001, is used here as a pilot case study to apply and discusses the preliminary version of the approach. Although some improvements are still needed, this approach can be already used to provides preliminary vulnerability scenarios and to point the way to the definition of more efficient and customized strategies for managing and mitigating flood risk in historic sites. Moreover, with further improvements and calibrations resorting to larger and more diverse data, it will be possible to reduce some of the uncertainties currently involved in the assessment process and to make its application wider and more robust.

Research on governmental emergency preparedness focuses predominantly on emergency management agencies per se but seldom assesses the full range of public sector agencies-nor how public managers specifically shape agency actions. This study addresses these gaps by investigating how perceptions and attitudes of administrators in nonemergency management agencies affect preparedness. Using a survey of U.S. public transit agencies, I demonstrate how managers' perceived risks and efficacy beliefs shape nonemergency public agencies' commitment to emergency preparedness. These findings suggest pathways for improved emergency preparedness across public sector agencies overall.

Competing water uses and climate change globally are putting more pressure on the limited water resources. Therefore, water-saving irrigation (WSI) is recommended for rice production in water scares areas. The impact of WSI techniques on direct-seeding rice production and greenhouse gas emissions in North China is becoming increasingly important in the era of climate change. Therefore, we conducted a two-year field experiment on directly seeded rice to assess the impact of traditional flooding irrigation (CK) and three water saving irrigation (WSI) methods, including drip irrigation with an irrigation amount of 50 mm (DI1) and 35 mm (DI2) at each watering time and furrow wetting irrigation (FWI), on rice yield and greenhouse emissions. Generally, the WSI techniques decreased the number of rice panicles per m(-2), spikelet per panicle, 1000-grain weight and rice yield compared to CK. Rice yield and yield components of (DI1) were significantly higher than (DI2). The adoption of either (DI1) or (FWI) showed insignificant variation in terms of rice yield and its yield components measured except for 1000-grain weight. The water productivity was 88.9, 16.4 and 11.4% higher in the FWI plot than the CK, DI1 and DI2 plots, respectively. The WSI decreased cumulative CH4 emission significantly by 73.0, 84.7 and 64.4% in DI1, DI2 and FWI, respectively, in comparison with CK. The usage of DI2 triggered 1.4 and 2.0-fold more cumulative N2O emission compared to DI1 and FWI, respectively. Area-scaled emission among the water-saving irrigation methods showed no significance. The yield-scaled emission in DI1 and DI2 and FWI were 101, 67.5 and 102%, respectively, significantly lower than CK. The adoption of FWI produced an acceptable rice yield with the lowest yield-scaled emission and highest water productivity among the irrigation practices. Our experiment demonstrates that dry direct-seeding with furrow irrigation can impact triple-wins of sustainable rice yield, high water-use efficiency and low GHG emissions in North China.

Many of the glaciers experience irregular, frequent, and sudden advances (surges) that pose an increasing threat of ice dam lake formation and subsequent outburst flooding throughout the region. In this study, we document 179 glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that occurred from 1533 to 2020 in five major valleys. Sixty-four of the events took place after 1970, and 37 of these had remote sensing imagery that covered the GLOF formation to breaching sequence. Thirty-six glaciers were associated with GLOFS due to ice-front advance building ice barriers in rivers. The Kayger and Khurdopin glaciers are the most hazardous examples, being responsible for 31.8% of major GLOFs in the entire Karakoram. Using a cross-correlation feature-tracking technique on remote sensing imagery, we analyzed ten surge glaciers and documented six surge events from 1990 to 2019. Results show periodic surge cycles for the Khurdopin, Kyager, Shishper, and Chilinji glaciers of c. 15-20 years, with a surge velocity in the mid-2010s higher than that of the late 1990s for all studied glaciers. The higher velocity of a glacier increases the risk of flooding downstream of the terminus because the transfer of a huge ice mass towards the terminus during the surge is a key factor for formation and reformation of series of ice-dammed lakes, thus determining the magnitude and frequency of outburst flood events. The response of Karakorum glaciers to global warming and climate forcing, comprising a continuum of glacier mass gain, ice thinning and ice advance, has resulted in lake formation and ice dam failures. We predict the frequency of GLOFs will increase in the future. These findings support the increasing anomalous behavior of glaciers in the Karakoram region. To synthesize the detailed observations, a conceptual model is presented of ice-dammed lake formation and GLOF initiation in response to glacier surging.

Community perception, response and adaptation strategies towards flood risk in a traditional African city	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Cities; Flood; People; Risk; Perception; Response; Adaptation	CENTRAL RIFT-VALLEY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH VULNERABILITY; PRECAUTIONARY ACTION; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; CITIES; HAZARD; URBANIZATION; PREPAREDNESS	In many world cities, flood incidences are on the increase due to climate change and increasing urbanization. Relying on structural flood control measures is becoming unsustainable, and new approaches revolving around improved land use planning, relocation, proofing, forecasting, warning and insurance are being advocated. These new measures require increasing understanding of the socioeconomic, cultural and political drivers that influence city dwellers' flood risks perception and adaptation. Unfortunately, public perception of flood risk and flood risk information is often overlooked when developing flood risk management plans. For Many cities, not much is known about peoples' flood risk awareness and perception, how much resilient they are, what adaptive capacities they possess and what socioeconomic, cultural and political drivers influence their risk perception and adaptive capacities. This was investigated in Katsina city of Nigeria through a questionnaire survey of 290 households, complemented with field observations and interviews. Results showed that the respondents in general have a fairly good perception of the nature, causes and consequences of flooding. However, flood-conveying structures were inadequate, with the few in most cases largely being used as waste-disposal sites. There was inadequate coordination between institutional stakeholders responsible for physical planning, waste and emergency management in the area. The respondents undertake some small-scale, ineffectively coordinated household-level proactive actions to minimize flood impacts, but no community-level flood early warning system exists. These create high flood-risks in the area and limit the flood resilience. Socio-cultural and income factors were the main determinants of flood adaptation, as the larger households with heads that are older and richer adopt more adaptation. However, there is general over-reliance on institutional bodies to provide and maintain flood-resilience promoting structures in the study area. Recommendation was made that a system needs to be put in place to incorporate some more robust preventive actions to bring about flexibility in flood management. To particularly be incorporated here include improved early warming, synchronous functioning of stakeholders, adequate physical planning, urban renewal, effective urban governance including harnessing of local social capital, increased community collaborative actions and use of local knowledge.

Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. This concern points to the resilience concept. By including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision-making, urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems. This study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextWe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience: the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time; the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses; and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state. Consequently, this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi-criteria index called Spatialized Urban Flood Resilience Index (S-FRESI). The S-FRESI composition (according to the resilience definition adopted) combines: the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility, to represent flood resistance mapped over time; the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation, considering the income variable; and the functional capacity of the drainage system, represented by the flood duration. S-FRESI can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. The index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the Dona Eugenia river catchment in Rio de Janeiro. Four different scenarios were formulated: (1) the current situation; (2) the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures; (3) a future situation with the same infrastructure as today; and (4) a future situation with the considered flood control measures.

J	Kumar, P; Patel, A; Rai, J; Kumar, P				Kumar, Pramod; Patel, Arbind; Rai, Jaya; Kumar, Prem			Environmental challenges and concurrent trend of weather extremes over Uttarakhand Himalaya	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article								Environmental challenges, including climate change-influenced weather extremes over the hilly region, are a major issue for the sustenance/ livelihood of Uttarakhand Himalayan biodiversity. The very high maximum temperature during summer days makes the area vulnerable to frequent forest fires, while the increasing frequency of intense rainfall proves devastating to infrastructure, croplands, and vegetation. Such erratic climate patterns make it increasingly difficult for people to live in the mountains and thus lead to climate-forced migration towards the plains. The investigation is concerned with weather/climate extremes and precisely how this affects the Himalayan people of Uttarakhand. Analysis of the extreme precipitation and temperature indicators for landslides and forest fire events has been performed. For the entire Uttarakhand region, strong declining trends have been observed for total precipitation, total runoff, soil water content, and leaf area index (LAI) for the ERA5 reanalysis datasets from 1981 to 2020 (40 years). Over central to western Uttarakhand, a consistent increase in the number of consecutive dry days is noticed both in the winter and the summer. The upper elevations of Uttarakhand nonetheless perceive days that are very wet and rainy. Over the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, elevation-dependent warming (EDW) continues to worsen climatic and weather extremes, making sustenance challenging. Over higher elevations, intense rainfall events are the main cause of landslides and flash floods. The frequency of very warm days and nights formerly increases over Uttarakhand's mountainous region, while the number of very cold days and nights declines. In the past forty years, there has been a rise in weather extremes in the Uttarakhand Himalaya. However, the community and decision-makers believe it difficult to cope with the extreme weather driven due to climate change. Thereafter, findings of this study will support in developing policies for the long-term development of Uttarakhand's mountainous regions.

In order to test responses to flooding and decreasing water potentials, over 3 years we germinated and grew seeds from three habitats of Euterpe edulis Mart. occurring along an altitudinal gradient.Seed germination and root growth were evaluated under different water availability treatments: control, flood, -0.4 MPa, -0.8 MPa, in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, and in the final year of the experiment (2014) at -1.0 MPa and -1.5 MPa.Seeds from the montane habitat did not germinate in the flooding treatment. Seed germination of all three habitats decreased in the -1.5 MPa treatment and the montane habitat had lowest germination in this treatment. Time required for half of the seeds to germinate increased up to -0.8 MPa. Seeds from montane habitats germinated more slowly in all treatments. The only difference in seed germination synchrony was an increase in the submontane population under the flooding treatment. However, synchrony decreased at the lowest water potentials. Roots of the montane population were more vigorous in most treatments, except at -0.8 MPa.The unusual ability of these seeds to germinate at low water potentials might be related to early seed germination at the onset of the rainy season, which potentially decreases seed predation pressure. Seeds of the montane population were more sensitive to both types of water stress. A predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme high rainfall or drought events may predispose early stages of this population to adverse factors that might negatively affect population viability with elevational in future climate change scenarios.

The coastal cities of Messolonghi and Aitolikon are typical examples, as they are built on top of old stream deposits near the coast. In the last several years, the gradual subsidence of the sites, combined with the impact of climate change, resulted in multiple floods. The rush of seawater over the lowlands has also been reported. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a remote-sensing technique that can provide a reliable and cost-effective solution, as it can be used to identify and monitor soil displacements. In this study, a novel parallelized PSI (P-PSI) processing chain, developed by the Operational Unit Center for Earth Observation Research and Satellite Remote Sensing (BEYOND) of the National Observatory of Athens, as well as the Copernicus EGMS product were used to identify these displacements. The results were examined in correlation with other potential factors such as the overexploitation of the underground water, the natural compaction of the clay soil layers, the primary and secondary consolidation due to the external construction loading, the oxidation of the organic soils, tidal gauge data, precipitation data, and ground truth data. In Messolonghi, various deformation rates were recorded, with maximum mean values of -5 mm/year in the eastern part, whereas in Aitolikon, the maximum values were around -4.5 mm/year. The displacements were mostly attributed to the primary consolidation due to the building loads. Deformation patterns and their correlation with precipitation could also be witnessed. It was evident that the increased precipitation rates and sea level rise played a leading role in the constant flooding.

Multi-proxy approaches including detailed sediment stratigraphy, sedimentology and geochemistry have been implemented in a high-resolution sedimentary section of paleo-oxbow lake of the Yellow River within the Zoige Basin on the NE Tibetan Plateau, to reconstruct regional environmental changes and extreme overbank flooding history. Our results suggest that not only traditional sedimentological proxies, but also chemical elements can be applied in defining sequences with different genetic types, especially the paleoflood deposits in the paleo-oxbow profile. Two units of late-Holocence extreme overbank flooding deposits (OFDs) are identified in terms of the significantly higher proportions of sand, high contents of SiO2, Na2O, Ba, low contents of Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, K2O, Ti, Rb and high values of Zr/Fe, Zr/Rb ratios. These extraordinary flood events within the Zoige Basin were dated back to 2,960 +/- 240-2,870 +/- 270 a and 1840 +/- 200-1700 +/- 160 a, in response to the mid-Holocene climatic optimum to the late Holocene and the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP). And the strong rainfall caused by the abnormal atmospheric circulation during the period of climate transition and abrupt change may led to the frequent occurrence of extreme flood events in the source region of the Yellow River. These findings are important for understanding the response of regional fluvial system to high climatic instability and provide a new perspective for us to analyze the risk of flood disasters on the Tibetan Plateau under the background of climate change.

J	Blöschl, G				Bloeschl, Guenter			Three hypotheses on changing river flood hazards	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Review							WESTERN CASCADES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-MOISTURE; RAINFALL; WATER; GENERATION; RESPONSES; TRENDS; EUROPE	There is serious concern that the hazard, or probability, of river floods is increasing over time. Starting from narratives that are sometimes discussed in public, the article addresses three hypotheses. The first suggests that land-use changes, such as deforestation, urbanisation and soil compaction by agriculture, increase flood hazards. This review finds that land-use effects on floods are particularly pronounced in small catchments since soil permeability plays an important role in infiltration at this scale. For regional floods, and the most extreme events, land use is usually not the most important control, since areas of soil saturation play a greater role in runoff generation, which are less dependent on soil permeability. The second hypothesis suggests that hydraulic interventions and structures, such as river training, levees and dams, increase flood hazards. This review finds that hydraulic structures have the greatest impact on events of medium magnitude, associated with return periods of tens to hundreds of years, and that their effects are usually local. Long-term interactions between humans and floods must be taken into account when predicting future flood hazards. The third hypothesis suggests that climate change increases flood hazard. This review finds that, in small catchments of a few hectares, flood hazards may increase due to convective storms. In large catchments, where regional floods occur, changes are not necessarily directly related to precipitation, nor are they directly related to rising air temperatures, but are determined by the seasonal interplay of soil moisture, snow and extreme precipitation via runoff generation. Increases and decreases in flood hazards have been observed worldwide. It is concluded that significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the role of land use, hydraulic structures and climate in changing river flood hazards. It is crucial to consider all three factors of change in flood risk management and communicate them to the general public in a nuanced way.

Many governmental and non-governmental organisations have been keen on implementing the SFRM strategies by integrating social, ecological, and economic themes into their flood risk management (FRM) practices. However, the justifications for SFRM are still somewhat embryonic, and it is not yet clear whether this concept is influencing current policies in different countries. This paper reviews the past and current flood management experiences from flood defence to SFRM in four developed countries to highlight lessons for coastal megacities in development. The paper explores recent strategies such as "Making Space for Water", Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in the UK and "Room for the River" in the Netherlands, which were implemented to mitigate flooding, integrate FRM with sustainability concepts, and deliver sound FRM practice for future generations. In this context, the United States has also established a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and in a different approach, Japan has developed an advanced flood warning and evacuation contingency system to prepare for climatic extremes. These case studies give good lessons in achieving long-term SFRM to deliver sound flood management practices considering socio-economic and environmental concerns. Most developing coastal megacities especially in Asia are still heavily reliant on a traditional hard-engineering approach, which may not be enough to mitigate substantial risks due to human factors (e.g. large population, rapid socio-economic growth, subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction) and natural factors (e.g. climate change including sea-level rise and land subsidence). It is clear that different countries and cities have their interpretation of SFRM, but this paper explores how policymakers can adopt "mixed options" to move towards long-term thinking about sustainability with social, economic, and environmental considerations.

To investigate this impact, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model was used to generate the basin-wide discharge and extract flood characteristics. Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), Western North Pacific Monsoon (WNPM), and their combined effect (ISWN) were considered and represented by monsoon index. The monsoon impact area was firstly obtained based on the monsoon impact on rainfall, followed by the anomaly analyses of flood characteristics within the impact area to quantify the monsoon impact on floods at local and spatial scales. The results show that the ISM and WNPM (or ISWN) can significantly modulate up to 20% of the rainfall interannual variability in the western and eastern parts of the basin, respectively. The monsoon impact on flood is regionally distributed with impact in tributary larger than mainstream. Over half of the monsoon impact areas show the flood start date averagely advances (delays) 8-12 days, flood volume averagely increases (decreases) by 9%-17.5% and Q10 averagely increases (decreases) by 7.4%-14.4% during the strong (weak) monsoon years. Also, the comparisons between monsoon local and spatial impacts reveal that the trade-off of water from different areas can disturb the monsoon impact on flood, suggesting that more stations should be used when using the observed data to analyze the monsoon impact. More importantly, the ISM tends to cause the severe flood in northern Thailand, while WNPM and ISWN mainly induce the severe flood in the southeastern part of the LMRB. This study could help to increase the knowledge of the impact of climate change on flood and help with the regional flood managements.

J	Jena, P; Azad, S				Jena, Pravat; Azad, Sarita			Observed and projected changes in extreme drought and flood-prone regions over India under CMIP5 RCP8.5 using a new vulnerability index	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; WESTERN-GHATS; RAINFALL; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; HAZARD; RISK; INDICATORS; MAGNITUDE	Past versions of the vulnerability indices have shown the ability to detect susceptible regions by assessing climatic and socioeconomic parameters at local scales. These parameters significantly vary over geographic regions, therefore such an index may not be suitable to identify and predict susceptibility over a large domain. The present endeavour aims to develop a new vulnerablity index that identifies and predicts the spatiotemporal imprint of extreme drought and flood cases at various scales in India by analyzing monthly observed and Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5) rainfall data at a spatial scale of 1 degrees x 1 degrees from 1901 to 2100. It is proposed by consolidating the outcomes of the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at different time scales, such as 3 and 12 months, along with the weights of individual grids. The weights of individual grids are calculated through the occurrence of extreme drought and flood years in the recent past to include a climate change factor in the proposed index. Based on the spatial distribution of high index values, the vulnerable regions concerning extreme droughts are expected to be in the Northeast, Northeast-central, East-coast, West, Northwest, North-central, and some grids in South India. Similarly, vulnerable regions concerning extreme flood cases are likely to be in the Northeast, West-coast, East-coast, and some grids in the Peninsular region. Furthermore, a conceptual model is presented to quantify the severity of extreme cases. The analyses reveal that on the CMIP5 model data, 2024, 2026-2027, 2035, 2036-2037, 2043-2044, 2059-2060, and 2094 are likely to be the most prominent extreme drought years in all India monsoon rainfall, and their impacts will persist for a longer time than others. Similarly, the most prominent extreme flood cases are likely to occur in the year 2076, 2079-2080, 2085, 2090, 2092, and 2099.

Adaptation of Multiobjective Reservoir Operations to Snowpack Decline in the Western United States	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS; WATER-RESOURCES; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; SOIL-MOISTURE; RIVER-BASIN; CALIFORNIA; HYDROLOGY; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; AVAILABILITY	Long-term snowpack decline is among the best-understood impacts of climate change on water resources systems. This trend has been observed for decades and is projected to continue even in climate projections in which total runoff volumes do not change significantly. For basins in which snowpack has historically provided intra-annual water storage, snowpack decline creates several issues that may require adaptation to infrastructure, operations, or both. This study develops an approach to analyze vulnerabilities and adaptations specifically focused on the challenge of snowpack decline, using the northern California reservoir system as a case study. We first introduce an open-source daily time-step simulation model of this system, which is validated against historical observations of operations. Multiobjective vulnerabilities to snowpack decline are then examined using a set of downscaled climate scenarios to capture the physically based effects of rising temperatures. A statistical analysis shows that the primary impacts include water supply shortage and lower reservoir storage resulting from the seasonal shift in runoff timing. These challenges identified from the vulnerability assessment inform proposed adaptations to operations to maintain multiobjective performance across the ensemble of plausible future scenarios, which include other uncertain hydrologic changes. To adapt seasonal reservoir management without the cost of additional infrastructure, we specifically propose and test adaptations that parameterize the structure of existing operating policies: a dynamic flood control rule curve and revised snowpack-to-streamflow forecasting methods to improve seasonal runoff predictability given declining snowpack. These adaptations are shown to mitigate the majority of vulnerabilities caused by snowpack decline across the scenario ensemble, with remaining opportunities for improvement using formal policy search and dynamic adaptation techniques. The coupled approach to vulnerability assessment and adaptation is generalizable to other snowmelt-dominated water resources systems facing the loss of seasonal storage due to rising temperatures.

To systematically evaluate the impacts of urbanization on floods, we applied a paired catchments approach to two adjacent river basins in south-central Texas - the San Antonio River Basin (SARB), with fast urbanization; and the Guadalupe River Basin (GRB), with lithe land cover change. A physics-based distributed hydrological model - the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model, embedded with a multi-purpose reservoir module (DHSVM-Res) - was used to simulate streamflow and reservoir storage. The simulations were conducted under different land cover scenarios, including a newly developed continuous land cover series (CLCS). Holistic analyses were then conducted for the paired basins using three methods: analyzing the selected flood events, detecting change points (CP) of monthly floods, and testing the elasticity of long-term flood regimes. The results suggest that (1) urbanization may reduce lag time and elevate flood peaks significantly by 3-30% in our study area; (2) when there is little land cover change, changing climate is the major driver of variations in the monthly maximum streamflow (MMS); (3) fast urbanization can amplify streamflow variability, increase MMS significantly, and thus alter the timing of CP; and (4) the mean MMS of observed streamflow in the SARB has increased by as much as 75.7% from the pre-CP to post-CP periods. This comprehensive study fills in a gap in our current understanding of the isolated impacts of urbanization on flooding and is expected to support future explorations of anthropogenic influences on floods.

J	Song, J; Yang, R; Chang, Z; Li, WF; Wu, JS				Song, Jing; Yang, Rui; Chang, Zheng; Li, Weifeng; Wu, Jiansheng			Adaptation as an indicator of measuring low-impact-development effectiveness in urban flooding risk mitigation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Adaptation; Resilience; Climate change; Hydrodynamic inundation model; Low impact development	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE MANAGEMENT; URBANIZATION; SUSTAINABILITY; CITIES	Frequent and intensive urban flooding requires an extensive adoption of low-impact development (LID) to supplement traditional drainage infrastructures. Our study conceptualizes the resilient infrastructure framework with a particular reference to adaptation, an adjustment capacity in the social-ecological system to withstand various natural hazards and absorb negative impacts. We argue that adaption is an indicator for measuring LID effectiveness. A methodological framework is adopted using a time-dependent technique with a hydrodynamic inundation model to evaluate LID effectiveness. Results of a case study in Gongming, Shenzhen, China, show that LID projects can effectively reinforce adaptation capacity. However, spatial inequality and accumulation of different levels of adaptation are evident. This outcome is due to a relatively low absorption capacity because most areas will have a relatively high recovery capacity but retain a low absorption capacity with the construction of LID projects. A relatively mild increase in absorption capacity is due to the quality of man-made infrastructural development is conflicting across different areas of Gongming, for example some infrastructures are constructed by the government, whereas others by developers and villagers. In addition, the topographical factor makes some areas in Gongming lower-lying than others and is therefore increasingly vulnerable to urban flooding during rainstorms given the difficulty of discharging the surface runoff, thereby limiting the effectiveness of LID projects. Furthermore, the spatial inequality of adaptation improvement where LID projects cannot be evenly distributed within the research area leads to the unequal distribution of adaptation. These findings can confirm that the government can practically use adaptation as an indicator in evaluating LID effectiveness and identifying the problematic stages of drainage resilience in urban flooding risk mitigation.

J	Tran, TA				Thong Anh Tran			Land use change driven out-migration: Evidence from three flood-prone communities in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Agricultural intensification; Land use change; Livelihoods; Out-migration; Rural development; Vietnamese Mekong Delta	RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION; LABOR MIGRATION; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; RICE; LIVELIHOODS; MANAGEMENT; INTENSIFICATION; REMITTANCES	In developing countries where agricultural production is exposed to adverse impacts of climate change, outmigration is commonly perceived as a safety net for poor farmers who lack adequate access to resources and capacity to adapt to change. In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), the land use change driven by the state-led development of water engineering systems (e.g., dykes) and subsequent agricultural mechanisation processes, while it fosters intensive agriculture-oriented development policies, is perceived as the key factor that dispossesses livelihood opportunities of a large segment of rural societies, particularly the poor. This paper aims to examine how land use change is linked to farmers' decisions to migrate. Drawing on the mixed data gathered from focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and household surveys in three flood-prone communities in the VMD, the paper argues that the land use change forms an underlying driver for the surge of out-migration of the rural poor. The study findings indicate that the dyke development for rice-based agricultural modernisation process (e.g., widespread adoption of agricultural mechanisation) creates greater risks of unemployment borne by the poor. As such, they exert out-migration as a viable strategy to adapt to change and to avoid "locked-in" impoverishment in rural areas. This study advocates that policy considerations for delta's rural development should be grounded on the empirical understanding of the land use change and its significance to ensure rural societies' gaining equal access to employment. The study findings provide opportunities for further investigation in comparison with other case studies across the Mekong region and beyond, where state governments still play a dominant decision-making in agricultural development.

Changes in hemolymph lactate and ammonia in the hermit crab Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) (Decapoda: Anomura: Paguridae) during shallow burial	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						ammonia detoxification; anaerobiosis; environmental hypoxia; global climate change; intertidal zone; metabolism; nitrogen excretion; sedimentation	JAPANESE INTERTIDAL CRAB; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; BLUE-CRAB; ENERGY-METABOLISM; DIFFERENT SALINITY; ACID-BASE; NITROGENOUS EXCRETION; ANAEROBIC METABOLISM; CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS; NEPHROPS-NORVEGICUS	Increased sedimentation in intertidal areas may stem from anthropogenic sources such as coastal development and natural processes, including discharges by rivers, landslides, and floods. Furthermore, global climate change could eventually lead to environmental hypoxia altering the composition of intertidal communities when hypoxia events surpass the physiological tolerance of intertidal organisms. We measured hemolymph lactate and ammonia (NH3 and NH4+) in the hermit crab Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857) subjected to shallow burial events and found high lactate and ammonia, indicating a switch to anaerobic respiration. The likelihood of hermit crabs dying during burial increased 31% for every 10 mM increase in lactate. Lactate levels were generally raised by increasing temperature, burial depth, or burial duration. At 20 oC and 30 oC, more lactate was detected at 3 cm and 6 cm burial depths than in the control (0 cm). Lactate concentrations were higher at 3 cm burial depth after 6 h than after 2 h. Lactate concentrations were higher at 20 oC and 30 oC than at 5 oC at both 3 cm and 6 cm. A 10 mu g ml(-1) rise in ammonia concentration was associated with increased probability of death by 21%. Ammonia concentrations were higher at 3 cm than at 6 cm, indicating a shift in ammonia production or excretion at 6 cm. Burial time did not impact ammonia production. Large numbers of hermit crabs survived up to 24 h following lactate (92.9%) and ammonium salt (83.3%) injections. These results provide evidence that neither lactate nor ammonia buildup are principal causes of death following shallow burial.

Rice growth simulation model, ORYZA (v3) was used in the present study to evaluate the model under continuous flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) regimes with different fertilizer nitrogen (N) rates with different N splits using a historical data of past 45 years. The model satisfactorily simulated crop biomass and nitrogen uptake at both irrigation regimes and fertilizers N rates and splits. The yield differences among the years were large due to climate change, but enhanced by N rates. The response of N curves was different at both water regimes. At 0 N rate, the slope for agronomic efficiency (AE) was high which tends to decrease with increase in N rates. With the one split basal application of N, lowest yield was found with high physiological efficiencies (PE), lowest fertilizer recoveries (RE) and lowest agronomic efficiency (AE). For both water applications and fertilizer levels, high yield with high nitrogen uptake, AE, RE and partial factor productivity (PFP) were witnessed high at four split (3:3:3:1), while having low physiological efficiency. The water productivity (irrigation + rainfall) WPI+R at basal in one N split for AWD at 150 kg N ha(-1) was 1.19 kg m(-3) and for CF was 0.82 kg m(-3), whereas for 225 kg N ha(-1) WPI+R of AWD was 1.50 kg m(-3) and 1.14 kg m(-3) for CF. In general, AWD exhibited high WPI+R with no rice yield penalty compared to CF. Splitting with the proper amount of fertilizer N resulted in good water productivity and nitrogen efficiencies, could lead to high rice yield.

Increasing urban flooding and waterlogging are associated with urbanization. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) experiences a rapid and extensive urbanization, leading to intensified land use and cover changes. Concurrently, the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events pose great challenges of urban flood control and water resource management to GBA. This research statistically analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of precipitation extremes from 1979-2018 which relates to the urbanization in GBA using various statistical methods including the Mann-Kendall test, bivariate Moran's test, and Spearman correlation analyses. The findings indicate that the impervious surface area in GBA exhibited a nonlinear growth trend from 1985-2018, particularly concentrated in the five major cities, i.e., Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan. GBA urbanization can be categorized into three stages including Stage I (pre-1990, no urbanization), Stage II (1991-2009, rapid urbanization), and Stage III (2010-2018, slow urbanization). Compared to cities with low urbanization, the highly urbanized areas of GBA, including Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Dongguan, show statistically significant increases in precipitation extremes. The increasing trends of seven extreme precipitation indices show significant positive, spatiotemporal correlations with the change rate of urbanization in GBA. Moreover, the influence of urbanization on precipitation extremes in highly urbanized regions of the GBA is progressively strengthened along with urban development. During the stage of slow urbanization, urbanization contributes to 56.13% of increase in annual precipitation totals in GBA, and its contribution to increases in precipitation extremes ranges from 20-80%.

J	Earl, E; Johnson, F; Marshall, L; Sanderson, D				Earl, Eleanor; Johnson, Fiona; Marshall, Lucy; Sanderson, David			A critical review of Natural Flood Management application and spatial prioritisation approaches in tropical island catchments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Flood modelling; Spatial prioritisation; Tropical island; Pacific Islands; Nature -based Solutions	ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE; PACIFIC; CHALLENGES; MITIGATION; STRATEGIES; SCIENCE; POLICY; RISK	Tropical island communities face substantial hydrometrological threats, including flood inundation. Flood risk is increasing, driven by climate change but also other factors including urbanisation, land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change, making flood management challenging to address in practice. Protecting, restoring, and emulating the natural functions of catchments to reduce flood risk, also known as Natural Flood Management (NFM), is a promising method for improving flood management. Global NFM research is in its infancy and NFM research in tropical island states has tended to focus on individual catchment projects. Therefore, overall trends, challenges, and opportunities for NFM in tropical island catchments are poorly understood and, until now, have not been reviewed across these geographies. A particular gap in NFM understanding in tropical island catchments is how NFM options can be best implemented within any particular catchment - specifically where NFM should be located, how modelling can support these decisions and the influence of different catchment characteristics on these decisions. This literature review aims to explore what, where and how NFM has been used in catchments in tropical island states, with a specific focus on catchment characteristics and spatial modelling. This paper draws on research and interconnections between multiple environmental science spheres, by reviewing both academic and grey literature to better understand how NFM has been applied in tropical island states, with a primary focus on Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). The research highlights that some islands have greater potential for exploiting NFM due to their physical catchment characteristics and data availability. NFM spatial modelling approaches need to be further developed and adapted to specific tropical island community requirements to improve inland flood resilience at the pace needed and to ensure resources are directed optimally.

We present a novel global dataset of extreme sea levels, the Coastal Dataset for the Evaluation of Climate Impact (CoDEC), which can be used to accurately map the impact of climate change on coastal regions around the world. The third generation Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM), with a coastal resolution of 2.5 km (1.25 km in Europe), was used to simulate extreme sea levels for the ERA5 climate reanalysis from 1979 to 2017, as well as for future climate scenarios from 2040 to 2100. The validation against observed sea levels demonstrated a good performance, and the annual maxima had a mean bias (MB) of -0.04 m, which is 50% lower than the MB of the previous GTSR dataset. By the end of the century (2071-2100), it is projected that the 1 in 10-year water levels will have increased 0.34 m on average for RCP4.5, while some locations may experience increases of up to 0.5 m. The change in return levels is largely driven by SLR, although at some locations changes in storms surges and interaction with tides amplify the impact of SLR with changes up to 0.2 m. By presenting an application of the CoDEC dataset to the city of Copenhagen, we demonstrate how climate impact indicators derived from simulation can contribute to an understanding of climate impact on a local scale. Moreover, the CoDEC output locations are designed to be used as boundary conditions for regional models, and we envisage that they will be used for dynamic downscaling.

Probable maximum precipitation in a warming climate over North America in CanRCM4 and CRCM5	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Probable maximum precipitation; Nonstationarity	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CHANGING CLIMATE; RETURN PERIOD; MODEL; PMP; METHODOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; FLOOD	In the context of climate change and projected increase in global temperature, the atmosphere's water holding capacity is expected to increase at the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) rate by about 7% per 1 degrees C warming. Such an increase may lead to more intense extreme precipitation events and thus directly affect the probable maximum precipitation (PMP), a parameter that is often used for dam safety and civil engineering purposes. We therefore use a statistically motivated approach that quantifies uncertainty and accounts for nonstationarity, which allows us to determine the rate of change of PMP per 1 degrees C warming. This approach, which is based on a bivariate extreme value model of precipitable water (PW) and precipitation efficiency (PE), provides interpretation of how PW and PE may evolve in a warming climate. Nonstationarity is accounted for in this approach by including temperature as a covariate in the bivariate extreme value model. The approach is demonstrated by evaluating and comparing projected changes to 6-hourly PMP from two Canadian regional climate models (RCMs), CanRCM4 and CRCM5, over North America. The main results suggest that, on the continental scale, PMP increases in these models at a rate of approximately 4% per 1 degrees C warming, which is somewhat lower than the C-C rate. At the continental scale, PW extremes increase on average at the rate of 5% per 1 degrees C near surface warming for both RCMs. Most of the PMP increase is caused by the increase in PW extremes with only a minor contribution from changes in PE extremes. Nevertheless, substantial deviations from the average rate of change in PMP rates occur in some areas, and these are mostly caused by sensitivity of PE extremes to near surface warming in these regions.

J	Clar, C				Clar, Christoph			How demographic developments determine the management of hydrometeorological hazard risks in rural communities: The linkages between demographic and natural hazards research	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						demographic change; hydrometeorological hazards; natural hazard risk management; natural hazards; rural communities	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDICATORS; FLOOD RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; EVACUATION DECISIONS; PLACE ATTACHMENT; PERCEPTION; ADAPTATION; POPULATIONS; EXPOSURE	The management of hydrometeorological hazard risks increasingly builds on the notion that the main constituents-hazard risk and vulnerability-have to be understood as dynamic processes. Natural hazards and their impacts are influenced by changes in land use and impacts of climate change, whereas the vulnerability of communities is, inter alia, determined by changes in their demographic composition. Structurally weak rural regions have to face these challenges, while their capacities to manage hydrometeorological risks are affected by major demographic developments, such as population decline and demographic aging (especially in Europe). Nonetheless, academic research regarding this issue is still in its infancy. Research on the relationship between hydrometeorological hazards and long-term demographic change often focuses on one side of the coin: impacts of hazards on the demographic composition of communities. The impacts of demographic change onto communities' ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural hazards appear as disregarded link. This article gives an overview over linkages by reviewing literature at the intersection of demographic and hydrological hazard research. The review of more than 90 publications provides insights into how particular demographic factors (socioeconomic status; migration, residency, and mobility; gender and gender relations; education and knowledge; and religion and beliefs) determine the management of hydrometeorological hazard risks. Furthermore, it identifies publications which consider long-term developments. The overview shows that we lack a thorough connection between demographic change and hydrometeorological hazard risk management, which would be crucial for in-depth studies as well as a more dynamic understanding of respective linkages.

We investigate the reservoirs (e.g., precipitable water, soil moisture) and water fluxes (e.g., precipitation P, evaporation E, precipitation minus evaporation P - E, and total runoff) of the water cycle. The projected intensification of the water cycle with global warming in the GLM region is reflected in robust increases in annual-mean P (multimodel median response of 0.81% K-1), E (0.57% K-1), P - E (1.58% K-1), and total runoff (2.08% K-1). Both surface (-0.83% K-1) and total soil moisture (-0.26% K-1) decrease as a result of increasing evaporative demand. Regionally, the Northern Hemispheric (NH) African, South Asian, and East Asian monsoon regions would experience an intensified water cycle, as measured by the coherent increases in P, P - E, and runoff, while the NH American monsoon region would experience a weakened water cycle. Changes in the monthly fields are more remarkable and robust than in the annual mean. An enhanced annual cycle (by similar to 3%-5% K-1) with a phase delay from the current climate in P, P - E, and runoff is projected, featuring an intensified water cycle in the wet season while little changes or slight weakening in the dry season. The increased seasonality and drier soils throughout the year imply increasing flood and drought risks and agricultural yields reduction. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C, the low warming target set by the Paris Agreement, could robustly reduce additional hydrological risks from increased seasonality as compared to higher warming thresholds.

This can be addressed by adopting sustainable drainage solutions (SuDS) in households. However, lack of knowledge and awareness among urban residents is a barrier. In this paper, we present an educational serious game called SuDSbury to overcome this barrier and a pre-/post-game survey-based evaluation to study whether the game can educate citizens (and to what degree). An exploratory study with 14 players across three game sessions suggests that playing SuDSbury induced changes in knowledge, comprehension, and personal norms regarding SuDS. However, comprehension of concepts related to urban drainage can be improved by increasing game realism. The game should be further tested with a larger sample and a diverse demographic of urban residents. The participants further found that SuDSbury is fun and engaging to play, making it suitable for broader public interventions.

The paper shows the challenges of interaction between their research areas and demonstrates the importance of how a researcher interacts with their selected study sites. My key points reflect the use of different methodologies within social and natural sciences and across them as well as the main challenge of who has the power to influence the research directions. Research is not value-free and is highly influenced by one's own training and knowledge, which needs to be addressed in the research activities. Finally, an option might be to move beyond interdisciplinary constraints and to work within a stronger transdisciplinary framework. Water research very much needs to interact with non-academic people to understand the challenges and possible solutions.

This prompts the question whether the closure of a mine constitutes the end of its life-cycle or whether the decommissioned mine can be employed for some other purpose. Best-practice references indicate that there are many viable options. In our opinion, the production of service water is one such option. Laboratory research was carried out on the water from a flooded underground coal mine in Ostrava-Karvina coal district, Czech Republic, concerning the production of service water from pumped mine -water. The research proved the practical feasibility of service or process water production. Given the effect of global climate change with regard to water resources, good prospects for this additional resource can be assumed since the water has to be pumped in any case for safety reasons.

In the long run, catastrophe is inevitable if nothing is done - yet each successive government and generation may fail to address it. Drawing on risk perception research, this paper argues that psychological biases cause the threat of nuclear war to receive less attention than it deserves. Nuclear deterrence is, moreover, a 'front-loaded good': its benefits accrue disproportionately to proximate generations, whereas much of the expected cost will be borne in the distant future. Recent surveys indicate that the US and Russian publics assign a surprisingly high likelihood to nuclear war. Nevertheless, earlier research suggests that it is probably not believed to be just around the corner. This, along with the absence of easy solutions, encourages governments and publics to give priority to more pressing concerns. The danger is that the pattern will continue clear up to the point that nuclear war arrives.

Urban flood resilience: Governing conflicting urbanism and climate action in Amsterdam	REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						resilience; climate change; neoliberal urbanism; urban governance; flooding; scale; Amsterdam	RE-SCALING IPE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; RISK; NEOLIBERALIZATION; GLOBALIZATION; RACIALIZATION; GEOGRAPHIES; UNCERTAINTY; NETHERLANDS	Amsterdam Rainproof emerged in 2014 to manage the risks posed by a novel environmental hazard threatening European cities: pluvial flooding, locally called cloudbursts. Amsterdam Rainproof's primary policy goal is to enhance Amsterdam's resilience to pluvial flooding. This paper examines the emergence of climate resilience and its execution on the ground in Amsterdam. In so doing, I draw on tools from economic geography - including the role of urban space and inter-scalar state restructuring - to contribute to debates in International Political Economy and the Environment (IPEE) on the relationship between resilience and neoliberal urbanism in global capitalism. I argue that there are inherent tensions between the rhetoric of sustainable urbanization put forth by Amsterdam Rainproof and its reality on the ground, namely that it ineffectively adapts urban spaces to increasing and unpredictable flooding while attempting to manage forms of capital accumulation at the urban scale.

Here, we carry out the first model-based assessment of urban impacts on extreme flood-producing storms for the European region. We identify contrasting roles of cities and climate warming in determining the space-time variability of the July 14, 2021 storm over western Europe. While climate warming dominates the temporal rainfall variability over the domain, cities further enhance total rainfall over their suburbs by dynamically modifying the intensity and position of moisture convergence. There is a cyclonic structure of flow anomalies around the city induced by urban surface roughness. The rainfall anomaly induced by the interactive impacts of cities and climate warming is 50% larger than by those urban impacts alone. We highlight a need to develop a regional framework by reconciling the emerging urban-rural contrasts in vulnerability and preparedness to hydrometeorological extremes.

Events are rare by definition, and return periods of heavy precipitation events are often calculated assuming a stationary climate. Furthermore, ensembles of climate model projections are not large enough to fully categorize the tails of the distribution. To address this, we cluster the contiguous United States into self-similar hydroclimates to estimate changes in the expected frequency of extremely rare events under scenarios of global mean temperature change. We find that, although there is some regional variation, record events are projected in general to become more intense, with 500-year events intensifying by 10-50% under 2 degrees C of warming and by 40-100% under 4 degrees C of warming. This analysis could provide information to inform regional prioritization of resources to improve the resilience of U.S. infrastructure.

Spatial coherency of the spring flood signal among major river basins of eastern boreal Canada inferred from flood rings	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Fraxinus nigra; Spring floods; Earlywood vessels; Lake Duparquet; Dendrohydrology; Flood ring	MACROCARPA TREE-RINGS; LAKE DUPARQUET; RED-RIVER; EARLYWOOD VESSELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLACK ASH; QUEBEC; RECONSTRUCTION; TRENDS; MANITOBA	In eastern boreal Canada, long-term perspective in water resources and hydroelectric dam management is currently limited by the lack of long-term hydrological records. The research for new paleohydrological proxies would help fill this hydrological data gap and provide regional hydroclimatic predictive trajectories in the context of climate change. The development of long annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area has recently demonstrated a high potential for reconstructing high and low discharges. This study analyzes a network of 10 sites scattered around Lake Duparquet. The region covers an area of about 20 000 km(2) including four river basins characterized by natural and regulated rivers, and unflooded control sites. The objectives were to assess 1) the spatial coherency in flood-rings chronologies among sites and Lake Duparquet, and among hydrological regimes (natural, regulated and unflooded control) and 2) their degree of association with i) annually resolved chronologies of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area and number, ii) a reconstruction of the Harricana River spring discharge and iii) discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area. It was hypothesized that flood rings would be consistent among natural rivers and absent from regulated rivers. Results showed high spatial coherency among natural rivers with flood rings recording the major floods of the last 250 years. Flood ring and earlywood vessel chronologies were strongly correlated to both reconstructed and instrumental discharge data. On regulated rivers, trees were younger than at the other sites and mainly spring floods that occurred prior to dam creation and the few extreme floods after dam creation were recorded by flood rings. One hypothesis is that older trees (before dam) most likely recorded the natural dynamic of the river, while younger trees (after dam) most likely recorded dam management maneuvers and spring flood exceeding dam capacity. Flood rings and earlywood vessel chronologies provided comparable and complementary hydrological evidence. Flood rings were easily identified visually allowing fast determination of major flood years whereas developing earlywood vessel chronologies, while being more tedious and time consuming, allowed capturing a larger spectrum of hydrological conditions	[Nolin, A.

J	Faridatul, MI; Wu, B; Zhu, XL				Faridatul, Mst Ilme; Wu, Bo; Zhu, Xiaolin			Assessing long-term urban surface water changes using multi-year satellite images: A tale of two cities, Dhaka and Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environment; Urbanization; Surface water; Management; Land cover; Local relationships	SPATIALLY VARYING RELATIONSHIPS; LANDSAT TIME-SERIES; URBANIZATION GRADIENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MODEL; RESOURCES	Water is a fundamental component of an urban environment. Management of water resources is important to facilitate a liveable environment and urban sustainability. Several factors affect water resources, including urbanization, climate change and seasons. Moreover, the nature of urban expansion and unsustainable water management practices have been associated with water scarcity, loss of biodiversity and increase of flood risk. Knowledge of the changes in urban surface water in relation to changes in seasons, land covers, anthropogenic activities, and topographical characteristics are important for managing watersheds and urban planning, and developing adaptation strategies to address environmental challenges posed by urbanization. However, existing studies rarely consider all the above factors when monitoring surface water changes in the urban environment. To address this problem, this study uses satellite images from multiple seasons and years, and assess the changes in surface water in relation to changes of several important factors, e.g., seasons, urbanization, land cover and topography. Moreover, this study applies advanced geostatistical tools to assess the local relationship between changes in surface water and the driving factors, and compares the findings in two cities Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Hong Kong with a large contrast in many aspects. First, seasonal influence in the distribution of water area is evaluated. Second, land cover classifications are assigned, and then the contingency matrix and decadal maps are formulated to investigate and evaluate the influence of urbanization on the occurrence and transitions in surface water. Third, an advanced geostatistical regression model is used to investigate the spatially varying relationships for change in surface water in relation to change in other land covers and topography. The investigations confirm that the temporal and seasonal variation, and urbanization induced land cover changes largely affect surface water. In addition, topography influences the nature of the city's expansion, which in turn entails the changes in surface water. The flat terrain of Dhaka facilitates the easy invasion of water bodies and horizontal expansion, in contrast, the steep terrain of Hong Kong prohibits horizontal expansion thus it's surface water is more stable than Dhaka.

The focus of current resilience models is predominantly developed countries, and less is known regarding how they might perform in other contexts. This paper presents a comparative case study in Bangladesh using two established hazard resilience models: the Disaster Resilience of Place (DROP) Model and the Spatially Explicit Resilience-Vulnerability (SERV) model. Using publicly available data, we applied the two models at the district level in the context of flooding, the most extensive hazard in Bangladesh. The results of our model implementations were evaluated by Bangladeshi emergency managers and researchers regarding their potential utility. Whereas emergency managers preferred the SERV model results, researchers thought the DROP model results were preferable. This suggests an opportunity to create a model that would serve the flood resilience needs of managers and researchers.

The goal of such initiatives is to avoid and minimize flooding as well as maintain the UDS's sustainable functionality, which can be analyzed using a stormwater management model (SWMM). In this study, a multiobjective automatic parameter-calibration (MAPC) framework was developed based on the SWMM. It consisted of three steps: sensitivity analysis (Step I), objective selection (Step II), and SWMM parameter calibration (Step III). The proposed MAPC framework was verified using the Yongdap drainage network located in Seoul, South Korea. The resultant MAPC framework demonstrated that the system characteristics (such as percent of impervious area and hillslope) and problems in UDS design, planning, and management can be well reflected by the corresponding model. The MAPC framework proposed in this study can contribute to UDS modeling sustainability.

The evaluations based on gauge-measured and model-simulated streamflow show the reliability of the DRIVE model. The typhoon tracks are divided into five categories for those that landed on or influenced Guangdong province. Generally, the spatial distribution of precipitation and floods differ for different typhoon tracks. Precipitation has a similar spatial distribution to flood duration (FD) but is substantially different from flood intensity (FI). The average precipitation over Guangdong province usually reaches its peak at the landing time of typhoons, while the average FD and FI reach their peaks several hours later than precipitation peak. The lagged correlations between precipitation and FD/FI are hence always higher than their simultaneous correlations.

The provisions about climate change in the area suggest that water stress will increase, so it is necessary to integrated it with spatial planning. This issues is also happens in Caraguatatuba, northern coast of Sao Paulo State in Brazil. There are planning tools developed for assessment the water stress, as Flooding's Risk Management Plan and Alert and Drought Period Special Plan in Jucar's Water Basin and Water's Safety Plan for Caraguatatuba. The main of this paper is to analyze the spanish tools to identify a commum structure for replicated it. Other main is, by the spanish practice, to identify opportunities for improvement the water stress management in Caraguatatuba. As results there are procedures in water stress planning, which deals with land use directives.

The Yahuarcaca Lakes System (YLS), consisting of four large interconnected water bodies situated on the floodplain of Amazon River, was identified as one of the key areas for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in the Colombian ARB. This review aimed to provide a general overview of YLS, present its environmental and biological features, identify main ecological and health threats, and propose mitigation strategies and future research prospects. A systematic search was performed using various databases. In summary, YLS harbors significant biodiversity and provides a number of ecological services for local communities, encompassing fish and drinking water supply and utilization of the floodplain for agriculture. Ensuring its sustainability requires attention from local and international authorities, collaboration with indigenous communities and future interdisciplinary research.

However, the public often does not recognize these problems due to perceptual barriers. The hypothesis of this paper is that such perceptual barriers can be overcome through 'climate revelatory visualizations' that communicate the problems and solutions in an understandable way and can nudge parties into taking action. We created and tested several photorealistic animated visualization styles. The results indicate that urban climate problems and adaptation measures should be presented in photorealistic animations with graphic overlays to overcome perceptual barriers. The climate revelatory visualizations should frame climate adaptation positively, and feature the everyday environments of the target audience. Visualizations that reveal current situations, specifically the risks of particular climate problems, prove to have a warning function, whereas visualizations that reveal adaptation measures can motivate citizens and urban designers to take adaptation action.

Available knowledge on damage mechanisms triggered by inundation phenomena is systematised in a usable and consistent tool, with the main strength represented by the integration of physical damage assessment into the evaluation of its economic consequences on the income of the farmers. This allows AGRIDE-c to be used to guide the flood damage assessment process in different geographical and economic contexts, as demonstrated by the example provided in this study for the Po Plain (north of Italy). The development and implementation of the model highlighted that a thorough understanding and modelling of mechanisms causing damage to crops is a powerful tool to support more effective damage mitigation strategies, both at public and at private (i.e. farmers) levels.

Spatial and seasonal patterns of flood change across Brazil	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						floods; Brazil; trends; seasonality	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; FREQUENCY; DISTRIBUTIONS; PERSISTENCE; DISCHARGE; RAINFALL; AMERICA; GERMANY; EUROPE	Brazil has some of the largest rivers in the world and has the second greatest flood loss potential among the emergent countries. Despite that, flood studies in this area are still scarce. In this paper, we used flood seasonality and trend analysis at the annual and seasonal scales in order to describe flood regimes and changes across the whole of Brazil in the period 1976-2015. We identified a strong seasonality of floods and a well-defined spatio-temporal pattern for flood occurrence. There are positive trends in the frequency and magnitude of floods in the North, South and parts of Southeast Brazil; and negative trends in the North-east and the remainder of Southeast Brazil. Trends in the magnitude (frequency) were predominant in the winter (summer). Overall, floods are becoming more frequent and intense in Brazilian regions characterized by wet conditions, and less frequent and intense in drier regions.	[Bartiko, D.; Oliveira, D.

Drawing on archival sources, geographic information systems and qualitative comparative analysis, it examines the production of high-risk neighbourhoods in Stockton, CA. With significant scholarly and practical implications, the findings reveal how different historical configurations of devalued racialised people and places, adverse housing market incorporation and displacement, and unequal flood protections are associated with elevated risk of exposure to climate-related sea-level rise in Stockton's high-risk neighbourhoods.

However, we have a limited understanding of mechanisms whereby sea level rise (SLR) changes flood drivers and contributes to flood compounding. Additionally, flood mitigation studies for fluvial floodplains near tidal water bodies often overlook the potential future contribution of coastal water levels. This study investigates the role of SLR in inducing high-tide flooding (HTF) and compound flooding in a neighborhood that lies on a fluvial floodplain. Eastwick, Philadelphia, is a flood-prone neighborhood that lies on the confluence of two flashy, small tributaries of the tidal Delaware River. We develop a combined 1D-2D HEC-RAS fluvial-coastal flood model and demonstrate the model's accuracy for low-discharge tidal conditions and the extreme discharge conditions of tropical Cyclone (TC) Isaias (2020) (e.g., Root Mean Square Error 0.08 and 0.13 m, respectively). Simulations show that Eastwick may experience SLR-induced HTF as soon as the 2060s, and the flood extent (34.4%) could become as bad as present-day extreme event flooding (30.7% during TC Isaias) as soon as the 2080s (based on 95th percentile SLR projections). Simulations of Isaias flooding with SLR also indicate a trend toward compounding of extreme fluvial flooding. In both cases the coastal flood water enters Eastwick through a different pathway, over a land area not presently included in some fluvial flood models. Our results show that SLR will become an important contributor to future flooding even in fluvial floodplains near tidal water bodies and may require development of compound flood models that can capture new flood pathways.

We analyze the climate-driven evolution of future levels of unconfined aquifers in the 218 world's major groundwater basins in global climate simulations following the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios, run with models able to capture feedbacks among climate, land use and groundwater. We find a rising of groundwater levels on global average, which is consistent with the projected global intensification of precipitation. This signal presents large regional disparities which mostly match the patterns of precipitation changes. As the climate models we used do not simulate human groundwater withdrawals (irrigation as well as domestic and industrial uses) which represent the other main driver of groundwater levels evolution, we also use Food and Agriculture Organization maps of present-day irrigated areas and projections of population in 2100 to identify regions where groundwater withdrawals could exacerbate the projected depletion, or even reverse a projected rise into a depletion. Depending on the scenario, we then find a rise (respectively a depletion) of groundwater levels in 2100 over 33%[28-39]% to 42%[41-45]% (respectively 26%[25-32]% to 37%[36-40]%) of the area covered by the 218 world's major groundwater basins. And we estimate that 31%[29-36]% to 43%[42-44]% of the world's population could be affected by these groundwater changes, facing either water scarcity issues (for 29%[27-33]% to 40%[39-40]% of the population), or increased risks of flooding (for 1.7%[1.5-2.2]% to 2.2%[2.2-2.4]% of the population).

The recent streamflow decline and more frequent hydroclimatic extremes have raised concerns about the water sustain -ability and water security of the UYRB in a changing climate. Here we examine the hydrological changes in the UYRB during the historical period (1961-2020) and the future period (2021-2070) using a physically-based hydrological model. Based on the simulation results, the future changes in water resources and hydroclimatic extremes in the UYRB were analyzed. The results show that the mean annual runoff volume in the UYRB during the future period will further decrease by 20.4 (SSP1-2.6), 17.7 (SSP2-4.5) and 22.0 (SSP5-8.5) billion m3 compared with the historical mean value. The agricultural drought severity will increase in all sub-regions, which tends to be more severe than the meteorological droughts, and Wujiang is going to experience the largest increase in drought severity. Averaged across the UYRB, the unprecedented agricultural droughts and pluvials will occur more than once per decade on average in the future, indicating that the most extreme events in the historical period would become the new normal in the future. The design floods with different return periods at all major hydrological stations in the UYRB are projected to increase, and in the future there will be more frequent drought-pluvial seesaws at the major hydrological stations. These findings highlight the impor-tance of adaptive water resources management to tackle the elevated risk of water shortage and more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes in the future UYRB.

An explicit link to thermodynamic and dynamic pathways in the climate system that may control water system performance is missing from current operational policies prescribed by regulation manuals within the US. In response, this study contributes an extended version of an existing weather regime (WR)-based stochastic weather generator (SWG) that allows (1) hourly simulation, (2) over the entire year, and (3) with a corrected representation of extremes. A range of climate scenarios is developed to demonstrate the insights that can be gained from linking the impacts of climate change to their thermodynamic and dynamic causal mechanisms, in this case for inflows to the Don Pedro Reservoir within the Tuolumne River Watershed of California. Application of the WR-SWG and water system modeling chain shows that the magnitude of flood events can be heavily influenced by antecedent hydrologic factors such as snow water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture. Our results suggest that, under all climate change scenarios, SWE decreases as temperature increases and contributes more (sometimes up to 2.5 times more than the baseline) inflow as part of rain-on-snow events. The monthly reservoir inflows show the potential to cause extreme floods as the average rate of inflow increases by up to 80% with temperature increases, whereas SWE tends to increase by 50%, adding water to the stream during the high flow season. In addition to the temperature increase, if the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, reservoir inflows are projected to increase. This provides insight for risk-hedging policies: winter storm and spring snowmelt release and storage decisions that drive flood and drought risk, respectively.

The coastal zone of Guinea-Bissau contains significant areas of low elevation and is home to most of the population and economic activity, making it already vulnerable to coastal flooding, especially during spring tides and storm surges (SS). Coastal flooding will tend to intensify with the expected SLR in the coming decades. This study aimed at quantifying and mapping the area exposed to the coastal flooding hazard using SLR scenarios by the years 2041, 2083, and 2100. The study analyzes and discusses the application of a the simple "bathtub" model coupled with a high-precision global digital elevation models (TanDEM-X DEM) to areas where no other data are available. Therefore, three coastal hazards hot-spots of Guinea-Bissau: Bissau, Bubaque, and Suzana, were used as case study. At each site, the area potentially exposed to coastal flooding was evaluated in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment, by estimating the Total Water Levels for each SLR scenario. For all areas, land exposed to coastal flooding hazard increases significantly and progressively with increasing SLR scenarios. Bissau and Suzana, where housing, infrastructure, and agricultural land are low-lying, presented the greatest flood exposure, while Bubaque, where housing and infrastructure are located in relatively high-lying land and rain-fed agriculture is practiced, present lesser flood exposure. The methodology presented is simple to use but powerful in identifying potentially vulnerable places to coastal flooding hazard, and its results can aid low developed countries to assess their exposure to coastal risks, thus supporting risk awareness and mitigation measures.

Therefore, understanding changes in global precipitation is of great importance to comprehend and solve water security problems. This study analyzed the characteristics of drought and flood alternation in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) based on precipitation data, and explored the driving forces of drought and flood alternation by combining relevant meteorological factors (i.e., temperature [Tem], relative humidity [Rh], wind speed [Win], and actual evaporation [ETa]) and teleconnection indices (i.e., Nino 3.4, Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO], Southern Oscillation Indices [SOI], North Pacific Index [NPI], and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation [AMO]). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation in the sub-basins of the YRB varied widely, with significant annual precipitation trends ranging from -5 to 9 mm/year < (p < 0.05). The maximum temporal difference in the rainy season reached 1-2 months; (2) The mutations of precipitation in the period of pre-flood (P-P), precipitation in the period of post-flood (P-N), and long-cycle drought-flood abrupt transition index (LDFAI) in sub-basins of the YRB (e.g., Mintuojiang River Basin [MRB], Wujiang River Basin [WRB], Dongting Lake Basin [DLRB], Yichang-Hukou Reach [YC-HK], Downstream of Hukou [DHKRB], and Taihu Lake Basin [TLRB]) were prominent from 2001 to 2011; and (3) both the single factor (i.e., meteorological factors or teleconnection index) and multiple factors (i. e., meteorological factors and teleconnection index) influenced the LDFAI of each sub-basin in the YRB. Related research is important and useful for studying dry-wet changes and water security issues in the YRB.

The extreme climate events are broadly classified into three categories: temperature and extreme warmth/coldness, precipitation and floods/droughts and western North Pacific typhoons. This commentary briefly summarizes the main findings presented in each paper in this topical collection, and outlines the implications of these findings for monitoring, detecting and modeling of regional climate change and for studying climate change impacts and adaptability. It also assesses the uncertainties of these studies, as well as the remaining knowledge gaps that should be filled in the future. One solid conclusion we can draw from these studies is that there was a marked decadal to multi-decadal variability of extreme climate events in East Asia in recent history, and the extreme events as observed during the last decades of the instrumental era were still within the range of natural variability except for some of those related to temperature. More severe and enduring droughts occurred in the early 20 th century or the earlier periods of history, frequently leading to great famines in northern China. Uncertainties remain in reconstructing historical extreme climate events and analyzing the early instrumental records. Further research could focus on the improvement of methodology in proxy based reconstruction of multi-decadal variations of surface air temperature and precipitation/drought, the recovery, digitization, calibration and verification of the early instrumental records, and the mechanisms of the observed multi-decadal variability of extreme climate in the region.

Least Developed Countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise and storm surges. The Mauritanian coast, West Africa, ranks among the most vulnerable worldwide to sea-level rise, and coastal communities in the National Park of Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) are particularly at risk. Here, we assessed the service of coastal protection in PNBA by (1) mapping the coastal marine ecosystems with Sentinel-2 imagery and determining their spatial wave height attenuation rates; (2) assessing the vulnerability of villages and natural habitats to coastal hazard risk; and (3) assessing the applicability of coastal protection measures in the PNBA. We found that a total of 83% of the populated coastline presents a moderate to high risk of flooding and erosion, with Iwik and R'Gueiba being the most threatened villages in the PNBA. As for the ecological risk, two low-elevated islands, which support breeding colonies of birds, are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. However, in other areas, the rupture in the dune cord created new lagoons that present valuable ecological and economic interests like the Lagoon of Bellaat. Improving the comprehension of wave attenuation provided by coastal habitats, combined with identifying the vulnerability and applicability of coastal protection measures, is essential for achieving the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction goals. In the PNBA, relocation of identified villages at risk is probably the best cost-effective solution with the least disturbance to both breeding and wintering birds. Protection of coastal ecosystems will also ensure a continued provision of other ecosystem services, including food supply for sea dependent populations, and contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.

Assessing the flood damage in the Mediterranean region is of great importance, especially because of its large vulnerability to climate change. Most past floods affecting the region were caused by intense precipitation events; thus the analysis of the links between precipitation and flood damage is crucial. The main objective of this paper is to estimate changes in the probability of damaging flood events with global warming of 1.5, 2 and 3 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and taking into account different socioeconomic scenarios in two western Mediterranean regions, namely Catalonia and the Valencian Community. To do this, we analyse the relationship between heavy precipitation and flood-damage estimates from insurance datasets in those two regions. We consider an ensemble of seven regional climate model (RCM) simulations spanning the period 1976-2100 to evaluate precipitation changes and to drive a logistic model that links precipitation and flood-damage estimates, thus deriving statistics under present and future climates. Furthermore, we incorporate population projections based on five different socioeconomic scenarios. The results show a general increase in the probability of a damaging event for most of the cases and in both regions of study, with larger increments when higher warming is considered. Moreover, this increase is higher when both climate and population change are included. When population is considered, all the periods and models show a clearly higher increase in the probability of damaging events, which is statistically significant for most of the cases. Our findings highlight the need for limiting global warming as much as possible as well as the importance of including variables that consider change in both climate and socioeconomic conditions in the analysis of flood damage.

As a large active rift basin in central China, Weihe Basin subsided and infilled in response to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and Asian monsoon variations. Many rivers drain out the erodible Chinese Loess Plateau with tremendous detritus and then build up considerable fluvial sequences. Scarcity of organic material and potential poor bleaching make the fluvial deposits difficult to date with radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique, and as a result hinder the palaeoflood reconstruction. This study attempts to compare OSL ages resulted from different grain size fractions of quartz, and then cross-checks with independent radiocarbon ages, aiming to choose proper method to reconstruct the chronology of a fluvial sequence from the valley bank of Shichuan River, a tributary of Weihe River. The results show that the coarse quartz grains experienced better bleaching than fine quartz grains, and the comparison with AMS C-14 ages further confirms the efficient bleaching of the coarse quartz grains before burial. The sufficient bleaching of the coarse fraction could be attributed to sediment source from the upstream mountainous areas and long-distance transportation. Finally, five palaeoflood events were identified at the times of approximately 2.3-2.6 ka, 3.7-3.9 ka, 4.1-4.7 ka, 6.2-6.8 ka, and 8.9-9.2 ka, corresponding to the periods with intensified rainstorm and vegetation degradation associated with climatic deterioration. This study provides a regional evidence to improve our understanding of the response of river system evolution to climate change.

We tracked Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000 participants in nine coastal districts of Bangladesh and collected further information in 2015. Our analyses suggest that both transient and permanent shocks induce households to migrate, but the effect is higher for the latter category. Using a difference-in-differences setting, we find that migrants' income and expenditure increase relative to their counterparts, indicating that facilitating migration may improve welfare in disaster-prone countries.

Climate change and global warming increase this risk and require implementing efficient strategies to anticipate the hazard and reduce human and material damage. This paper describes a generic platform called LittoSIM-GEN (a coupling of agent-based and hydrodynamic models), which aims to involve stakeholders in a participatory simulation of land use management to minimize the risks of coastal submersion. An application to the southwest coast of France (Rochefort) demonstrates the features of this platform. We propose several recommendations to improve the generic conception and implementation of models dedicated to participatory simulation.

Field observations however show that scientific knowledge encounters at local level other sources of environmental knowledge which can present resistance to risk management propositions. This special issue adopted a constructivist frame to analyse how natural risks (coastal floods and earthquakes) are locally understood, remembered, and avoided. The comparative fieldwork approach across national contexts (Italy, France and Morocco) in which different natural risks were considered revealed similar local psychosocial dynamics which may be summarised as follows: (1) Knowledge diversity; (2) Local history and trust; (3) Shifting risk rationalisations and (4) Risk objectification.

This challenge calls for new policies and actions at regional and local level having the concept of resilience as their main driver and core component. However in order to prioriotirise and invest in the resilience building, the actors involved in the governance of a territory and in the implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction measures must first recognize the multifacted nature of resilience and the importance of its measurement. Priorities, resilience meaning and metrics are subject to different interpretations, making resilience a societal complex issue. To this end the paper aims to provide a new method for the incorporation of multilevel stakeholders' view in the assessment of the inherent resilience of a place and in the design of a metric based Resilience Index (RI). The new approach integrates the Disaster Resilience of Place (DROP) model and the use of semi-structured interviews with a standpoint in the Grounded Theory Methodology to facilitate both the assessment of resilience in a quantitative manner and an in-depth analysis of the context. The method has been applied in the framework of coastal exposure to flood, by involving 18 municipalites of the Po River Delta (Italy). The interactions of the, physical and anthropogenic processes in the Po River Delta requires a better understanding in terms of resilince to support sustainable management and spatial planning actions in the context of climate change. The analysis spreads across different administrative boundaries and complex and dynamic natural systems that have recreational, residential and economic functions. The results demonstrate the potentiality of the method to guide different local actors in their disaster resilience strategy and in the identification of priorities.

Eroding Land and Erasing Place: A Qualitative Study of Place Attachment, Risk Perception, and Coastal Land Loss in Southern Louisiana	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						coastal land loss; risk perception; place attachment; risk mitigation; community	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; FLOOD EXPERIENCE; COMMUNITY; SENSE; RESIDENTS; BEHAVIOR; LEVEL; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK	Southern Louisiana and its coastal bayous are sites of both frequent flooding and rapid coastal land loss, exacerbated by the increasing effects of climate change. Though much work has examined flood risk perceptions in coastal areas, few studies have considered the qualitative and contextual dimensions of perceptions of coastal land loss and its associated impacts, and how these perceptions relate to local culture, place, and intentions to mitigate personal exposure to risk. We conducted six focus groups in areas with distinct exposure to coastal land loss. Participants expressed strong attachment to community, culture, and place. Personal ties to land loss through family or social connections, experiences with fishing and water-based activities, and indirect impacts on Louisiana's seafood industry and cuisine provided a lens for understanding the immediate impacts of coastal land loss. Participants felt that exposure to the risks of land loss was inevitable and that mitigation was beyond individual efforts, a feeling that manifested both as pessimism and as a resilient focus on collective action. Considering state history with political corruption, participants generally distrusted state-level mitigation initiatives. These findings shed light on the qualitative dimensions of coastal land loss perceptions in southern Louisiana and their relation to place attachment, mitigation intentions, and sources of risk information. While participants with personal ties to risk report feelings of exposure and inevitability, they are also embedded in communities with strong ties to place. This nuance only complicates the meanings that individuals associate with land loss and the actions that they are motivated to take; impacts of coastal land loss on the landscape and distinct place characteristics of southern Louisiana may lead to significant disruption to identity and well-being, but also provide a pathway for risk awareness and potential motivation of collective mitigation actions.

While the two deltas are highly productive regions, they are vulnerable to natural hazards and the effects of human-induced environmental change. To show that the processes and issues affecting food security are reinforcing, interdependent and operating at multiple scales, we used a systems-thinking approach to represent the major linkages between anthropogenic land-use and natural hazards and elaborate on how the drivers and environmental processes interact and influence rice growing area, rice yield and rice quality in the two deltas. On a local scale, demand for aquaculture and alternative crops, urban expansion, dike development, sand mining and groundwater extraction decrease rice production in the two deltas. Regionally, upstream dam construction impacts rice production in the two deltas despite being distally situated. Separately, the localized natural hazards that have adversely affected rice production include droughts, floods and typhoons. Outbreaks of pests and diseases are also common Climate-change-induced sea level rise is a global phenomenon that will affect agricultural productivity. Notably, anthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural productivity or increase economic growth can create many unwanted environmental consequences such as an increase in flooding, saltwater intrusion and land subsidence, which in turn decreases rice production and quality. In addition, natural hazards may amplify the problems created by human activities. Our meta-analysis highlights the ways in which a systems-thinking approach can yield more nuanced perspectives to tackle "wicked" and interrelated environmental challenges. Given that deltas worldwide are globally significant for food production and are highly stressed and degraded, a systems-thinking approach can be applied to provide a holistic and contextualized overview of the threats faced in each location.

J	Lang, A; Mikolajewicz, U				Lang, Andreas; Mikolajewicz, Uwe			The long-term variability of extreme sea levels in the German Bight	OCEAN SCIENCE			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM SURGES; WATER LEVELS; TRENDS; TIME; SIMULATIONS; DEPENDENCE; ENSEMBLE; SCENARIO	Extreme high sea levels (ESLs) caused by storm floods constitute a major hazard for coastal regions. We here quantify their long-term variability in the southern German Bight using simulations covering the last 1000 years. To this end, global earth system model simulations from the PMIP3 past1000 project are dynamically scaled down with a regionally coupled climate system model focusing on the North Sea. This approach provides an unprecedented long high-resolution data record that can extend the knowledge of ESL variability based on observations, and allows for the identification of associated large-scale forcing mechanisms in the climate system. While the statistics of simulated ESLs compare well with observations from the tide gauge record at Cuxhaven, we find that simulated ESLs show large variations on interannual to centennial timescales without preferred oscillation periods. As a result of this high internal variability, ESL variations appear to a large extent decoupled from those of the background sea level, and mask any potential signals from solar or volcanic forcing. Comparison with large-scale climate variability shows that periods of high ESL are associated with a sea level pressure dipole between northeastern Scandinavia and the Gulf of Biscay. While this large-scale circulation regime applies to enhanced ESL in the wider region, it differs from the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern that has often been linked to periods of elevated background sea level. The high internal variability with large multidecadal to centennial variations emphasizes the inherent uncertainties related to traditional extreme value estimates based on short data subsets, which fail to account for such long-term variations. We conclude that ESL variations as well as existing estimates of future changes are likely to be dominated by internal variability rather than climate change signals. Thus, larger ensemble simulations will be required to assess future flood risks.

Relocated beaver can increase water storage and decrease stream temperature in headwater streams	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						beaver; Castor canadensis; climate change; dam; groundwater; hydrology; reintroduction; relocation; salmonid; stream; temperature; wetland	CASTOR-CANADENSIS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; DAMS; RESTORATION; ASSEMBLAGES; HABITATS; SURVIVAL; WETLANDS; TROUT	Many areas are experiencing increasing stream temperatures due to climate change, and some are experiencing reduced summer stream flows and water availability. Because dam building and pond formation by beaver can increase water storage, stream cooling, and riparian ecosystem resilience, beaver have been proposed as a potential climate adaption tool. Despite the large number of studies that have evaluated how beaver activity may affect hydrology and water temperature, few experimental studies have quantified these outcomes following beaver relocation. We evaluated changes in temperature and water storage following the relocation of 69 beaver into 13 headwater stream reaches of the Skykomish River watershed within the Snohomish River basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated how beaver dams affected surface and groundwater storage and stream temperature. Successful relocations created 243 m(3) of surface water storage per 100 m of stream in the first year following relocation. Dams raised water table elevations by up to 0.33 m and stored approximately 2.4 times as much groundwater as surface water per relocation reach. Stream reaches downstream of dams exhibited an average decrease of 2.3 degrees C during summer base-flow conditions. We also assessed how dam age, condition, maintenance frequency, and pond morphology influenced stream temperature at naturally colonized wetland complexes. Our findings demonstrate that dam building can increase water storage and reduce stream temperatures in the first year following successful beaver relocation. Fluvial and floodplain morphology of candidate reaches for relocation is an important consideration because it determines the type and magnitude of response. Relocation to reaches with existing small, abandoned ponds may address thermal criteria by conversion from warming to cooling reaches, whereas relocation within large, abandoned complexes or vacant habitat may result in greater water storage. Although beaver relocation can be an effective climate adaptation strategy to retain more stable hydrologic regimes and water quality in our study area, there appear to be regionally specific environmental and geomorphic factors that influence how beaver affect water storage and temperature. More research is needed to investigate how and why these regional differences affect water storage and stream temperature response in beaver-influenced systems.

The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal (summer & winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999, 2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts, and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of 0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km(2) and 79.90 km(2), respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 % and 50.46 % of the summer and 3.02 % and 13.02 % of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 degrees C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature). This study provides the useful guidelines for agricultural officers, urban planners, and environmental engineers to understand the spatial configurations of built-up area enlargement and provide effective policy measures to conserve farming lands to ensure environmental sustainability.

Soil erosion and sediment dynamics in the Anthropocene: a review of human impacts during a period of rapid global environmental change	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Review						Sediment archives; Paleoenvironmental reconstruction; Sediment-associated contaminants; Cryosphere; Freshwater biota; Climate change	LAND-USE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENT; FRASER-RIVER BASIN; LAST 100 YEARS; SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; NECHAKO RIVER; WATER-QUALITY	Purpose Humanity has been modifying the planet in a measurable way for thousands of years. Recently, this influence has been such that some feel we are in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This review will describe how soil erosion and sediment dynamics have (i) been used to assess the impact of humans on the planet and (ii) affected the global climate and influenced water security. Emphasis is placed on changes since the middle of the twentieth century, as this coincides with what many suggest is the start of the Anthropocene Epoch. Results and discussion The use of sediment archives has been instrumental in our understanding of how environmental systems have developed over time, both naturally and in response to anthropogenic activities. Additional information has come from measurement and monitoring programs, and tracing and fingerprinting studies. In turn, models have been developed that enable forecasting. Some of the main global impacts of enhanced soil erosion and changes in sediment dynamics and sediment composition include: changes in radiative energy balances and impacts on the cryosphere; the global carbon cycle; and greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts on water security include: effects on freshwater biota, including wild salmon populations; fluxes of contaminants, including microplastics; and reservoir and river channel sedimentation, including flooding. Sediment archives and monitoring programs have also been used to document the effect of mitigation measures and environmental policies. Conclusion Sediment archives enable us to assemble information over a variety of timescales (i.e., 10(0) to 10(5) years and longer) and a range of spatial scales (from sub-watershed to continental), in addition to environments ranging from arid to tropical to polar. Often the temporal resolution is better than other paleoenvironmental reconstruction approaches. As such, sedimentary records, when combined with measurement and monitoring approaches and other sources of information, have enabled us to determine changes in atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems, especially over the last 100 years. While soil erosion and sediment dynamics have provided a wealth of information and greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of humanity in modifying the planet, suggestions are given for further research.

Hydropower development in the trans boundary Koshi river basin in the Himalayan region presents an intervention that can support the SDGs whilst meeting the regional commitments to the Paris agreement. This study aims to quantify the benefits of proposed water resource development projects in the transboundary basin (4 storage and 7 run-of-the-river hydropower dams) in terms of hydroelectric power generation, crop production and flood damage reduction. A hydro-economic model is constructed by soft coupling hydrological and crop growth simulation models to an economic optimization model. The model assesses the potential of the interventions to break the vicious cycle of poverty and water, food, and energy insecurity. Unlike previous studies, the model (a) incorporates the possibility of using hydropower to pump groundwater for irrigation as well as flood regulation and (b) quantifies the resilience of the estimated benefits under future climate scenarios from downscaled general circulation models affecting both river flows and crop growth. The results show significant potential economic benefits generated from electricity production, increased agricultural production, and flood damage control at the transboundary basin scale. The estimated annual benefits are around USD 2.3 billion under the baseline scenario and USD 2.4 billion under a future (RCP 4.5) climate scenario, compared to an estimated annual investment cost of USD 0.7 billion. The robustness of the estimated benefits illustrates the climate resilience of the water resource development projects. Contrary to the commonly held view that the benefits of these proposed projects are limited to hydropower, the irrigation and flood regulation benefits account for 40 percent of the total benefits. The simulated scenarios also show substantial irrigation gains from the construction of the ROR schemes, provided the generated power is also used for groundwater irrigation. The integrated modelling framework and results provide useful policy insights for evidence-based decision-making in transboundary river basins around the globe facing the challenges posed by the water-food-energy nexus.

The case study of this research is the urban public space in the coastal city of Quarteira, which is particularly vulnerable. This space between the land and the sea has been recently framed in the inter-municipal climate change adaptation plan PIAAC-AMAL (Plano Intermunicipal de Adaptacao as Alteracoes Climaticas do Algarve). The aim of the article is to explore the natural and anthropogenic process of formation and transformation of the urban space between the land and sea that occurred over time, up to the definition of the seashore street. Interpretative drawing is used as a methodology to understand the form of the public space. This is considered the first step for designing the public space between the land and the sea that deals both with the effects of climate change and the seasonal cycles of summer tourism. Through this analysis, it is argued that the understanding of the form (morphological characteristics) of this continuous space between land and sea is fundamental for consistent and robust adaptation design.

At present, most of these hydroclimatic extreme events are documented by the media as individual events; however, in scientific terms, many are better understood as concurrent events-concurrent extremes of both temperature and precipitation (e.g., drought, floods). This paper considers concurrent changes in hydroclimate extremes, including heatwaves, drought, flooding, and low flows, in six historical-to-future (1970-1999, 2070-2099) Earth System Model (ESM) climate scenarios for the Colorado River basin. Results indicate that temperature-driven Impacts (heatwaves, drought) have the strongest responses while precipitation-driven Impacts have weaker responses. All Impacts exhibit an increase in magnitude from synoptic to annual time scales, with heatwaves increasing in strength about three times at the annual time scale versus the synoptic, while low flows only increase slightly. Critical watersheds in the Colorado were identified, highlighting the Blue River basin, Uncompahgre, East Taylor, Salt/Verde watersheds, locations of important water infrastructures, water resources, and hydrological research. Our results indicate that concurrent extreme hydroclimate events are projected to increase in the future and intensify within critical regions of the Colorado River basin. Considering extreme hydroclimate events concurrently is an important step towards linking economic and social effects of these events and their associated instabilities on a regional scale.

J	Park, K; Yu, I				Park, Kiyong; Yu, Insang			Evaluating the vulnerability of buildings to urban flooding using the fuzzy inferences method	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Urban flood; Building characteristics; Vulnerability; Fuzzy	DAMAGE	The scale of urban flooding has grown recently in size and frequency because of climate change, but it remains difficult even to predict at-risk areas due to various uncertainties including local downpours. Thus, the vulnerability of each building was analyzed to minimize flood damage by classifying the vulnerability of each building to flood damage during flooding events in urban areas. The buildings that need to develop anti-flood measures were identified with priority scoring. To prepare measures for land use and building, non-structural measures, characteristic land use indicators, and buildings were selected. The vulnerability of each building towards flooding was analyzed using the fuzzy model and categorized into five grades. Urban flooding vulnerability analysis of 108,256 buildings in Ulsan City showed that Red Buildings 2,156 (occupied 1.99%), Orange Buildings 927 (occupied 0.86%), Yellow Buildings 97,296 (occupied 89.88%), Yellowish-green Buildings 2,092 (occupied 1.93%) and Green Buildings 5,785 (occupied 5.34%). The analysis indicated that industrial complexes with basements in new towns and slack old sections of the city exhibited high vulnerability. Buildings and areas with higher asset values and higher building densities, in particular, had high vulnerability, and buildings with basements and aged buildings were also potentially vulnerable. The vulnerability analysis of each building to urban flooding can be used to determine the urban spatial appropriateness of each building. Buildings with high vulnerability are significant, as it may provide a sense of direction for preparing preferential measures, enabling improved efficiency and systematic management.

The sequence evolved from a lacustrine phase (between 12,700 cal yr BP and 12,000 cal yr BP) into an ombrotrophic peat bog (12,000-7600 cal yr BP), accumulated in drier climate conditions, with a subdued water table. Subsequently, wetter conditions occurred, with an elevated water table until 6220 cal yr BP, when the peat bog was flooded and peat accumulation paused, a depositional hiatus being marked by a clayey layer. Peat started to accumulate again ca. 100 years ago, under drier conditions. The peat bog records the local and regional responses to rapid climate change events that occurred at 11,400-11,250, 10,500-10,200, 9400-9200, and 8300-8250 cal yr BP. Our quantitative reconstruction of hydrological changes, as well as pre-existing ones for this region, show similar conditions to those that occurred in Central-Eastern Europe between 12,700 and 7600 cal yr BP, but differ from those that occurred between 7600 and 6220 cal yr BP, suggesting a distinct regional character of Middle Holocene climate conditions in Romania.

APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						Climate risk; meteorological disaster; business performance; diversification	TEMPERATURE	Climate change has become the greatest challenge for humanity in the 21st century, and extreme climate risks not only cause substantial direct economic losses, but also affect the operations of micro-enterprises. Based on financial data for Chinese A-share listed companies and meteorological disaster-loss data, this study found that comprehensive meteorological disaster losses significantly reduce firm performance, with rainstorm induced flood (landslide and mud-rock flow) disasters, drought disasters, gale, hail and lightning disasters being the most obvious. Further analysis showed that underperforming and smaller companies are more affected by meteorological disasters and that companies with diversified business operations and more managerial climate attention are less affected by meteorological disasters.

Climate change alters precipitation patterns, which increase a risk for urban drainage systems (UDS) operating above their design limits. Therefore, feasible solutions are needed to retrofit UDSs to new climate conditions. In this study, street storage units (SSU) are coupled with a predictive real-time control algorithm to temporarily accumulate stormwater and thus minimise the risk of UDS surcharge. SSUs are operated in distributive mode and do not directly affect the flow in the pipeline, which makes the system less vulnerable to failures. SSUs are fully usable for citizens in dry periods. The results showed that control of 6% key inflows with SSUs reduced the number of flood nodes by 30% during an extreme weather event. The solution was successfully tested in Rakvere town, Estonia.

THE EXPLOITATION OF THE DECIDUOUS FOREST OF THE PLAIN IN THE OLD DEPARTMENT OF IMPERIAL (ARAUCANIA REGION), 1867-1920	HISTORIA-SANTIAGO			Spanish	Article						Chile; nineteenth century; Araucania; Imperial; timber felling; environmental history	LANDSCAPE	The timber exploitation in the department of Imperial between 1867 and 1920 is analysed for the first time, taking into account the causes of this exploitation, the form in which the wood was harvested, and the environmental consequences of this activity. Primary sources (records and writings from travellers, government officials and naturalists, among others) and secondary sources (primarily historical, archaeological, and paleo-environmental studies) were analysed for this purpose. The results show that i) the forest was exploited due to constructive, ideological, and profit related motives, ii) the wood was extracted using traditional methods, for example, by hand and with the aid of oxen, and iii) the destruction of the forest lead to the loss of biodiversity, to micro-climatic changes and to the unusual flooding of rivers, due to riverbed silting, as a result of the deforestation.

Arguments for a co-production approach to community flood protection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						floods & floodworks; infrastructure planning; social impact	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VALUES; RISK; MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; VULNERABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; ADAPTATION; ENGAGEMENT	With more intense rainfall and sea level rises predicted, an increasing number of people across the UK are vulnerable to flood events. The government has pledged more funding for flood infrastructure planning, design and management. However, schemes tend to focus on technical solutions, with the social impact, including needs and concerns of the local community, seen as secondary. Based on a detailed examination of three case studies in England, this paper identifies the mechanisms through which current processes restrict industry professionals from considering and incorporating the social perspective, often despite seemingly effective community engagement. The paper argues for an approach that incorporates social concerns alongside technical ones. Rather than 'community engagement', it is argued that 'co-production', in which lay communities work alongside technical experts in the design of flood risk alleviation schemes, would enable a final outcome that is both more socially acceptable and more technically successful.

Analysis of maps and satellite images of the Arctic coasts has been a basic method of recognizing these islands. Their origin is the final stage of a process which began in the twentieth century. They appear only on the coasts where bedrock elevations above sea level are surrounded by depressions below this level, filled (at least from the landside) with glaciers. Their recession leads to flooding of the depressions by sea water, thus creating straits which separate the new islands from the mainland. Hence, such new islands appear only in Greenland and the European Arctic. Their ecosystems accommodate to new environmental conditions. In the near future, this process will be intensified in a situation of further warming.

In terms of the current research status in China, there is a lack of thorough investigations on the linkage between extreme precipitation and climate change. This paper aims to determine the dominant climate indices as well as the corresponding significant time scales and periods affecting extreme precipitation over China for dynamic assessments of the upcoming rainstorm risk. Correlations between 15 climate indices and precipitation extremes, as well as the correlations among climate indices, are fully explored to identify potential predictors for non-stationary modeling. Then, 21 non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) models are constructed, and the optimal covariates as well as their lag times with extreme precipitation at 769 stations are ascertained in a Bayesian framework. Finally, a complete predictive process is developed, and the national rainstorm risk under non-stationary conditions is assessed. The results indicate that precipitation extremes remain stationary only at 74 stations (less than 10%). WPI is dominant in modeling the variability in precipitation extremes for nearly 22% of the total stations, ranking first among all the climate indices. The predominant time scale affecting extreme precipitation at the majority of stations is 3 months. Ignoring the non-stationarity of extreme precipitation inevitably leads to misperceptions of rainstorm risks, and the spatial distribution of the maximum case of the design rainstorms under non-stationary conditions differs remarkably from that under stationary conditions. Our findings have important implications for the in-depth understanding of the real drivers of extreme precipitation non-stationary and enable advanced predictions of rainstorm risks for mitigating subsequent disasters.

Despite the growing risk of humid-heat stress (measured by wet-bulb temperature), it has received less attention in East Africa, where arid and semi-arid climatic conditions prevail. Moreover, no consensus has yet been reached across models regarding future changes in rainfall over this region. Here, we screen Global Climate Models (GCMs) from CMIP5 and CMIP6 and use, for boundary conditions, simulations from only those GCMs that simulate successfully recent climatic trends. Based on these GCMs and Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations, we project that annual mean temperature is likely to rise by 2 celcius toward midcentury (2021-2050) at a faster rate than the global average (about 1.5 celcius), under the RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, associated with more frequent and severe climate extremes. In particular, low-lying regions in East Africa will be vulnerable to severe heat stress, with an extreme wet-bulb temperature approaching or exceeding the US National Weather Service's extreme danger threshold of 31 celcius. On the other hand, population centers in the highlands of Ethiopia will receive significantly more precipitation during the autumn season and will see more extreme rainfall events, with implications for flooding and agriculture. The robustness of these results across all GCM and RCM simulations, and for both of CMIP5 and CMIP6 frameworks (CMIP: Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project) supports the reliability of these future projections. Our simulations of near-term climate change impacts are designed to inform the development of sound adaptation strategies for the region.	[Choi, Yeon-Woo; Eltahir, Elfatih A.

However, variations in deposition rates on a centennial-scale over the last 2000 years remain poorly studied for mega-deltas. Based on optically stimulated luminescence and AMS C-14 ages, we calculated deposited sediment volumes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) for 500-year intervals over the last two millennia for the first time. Our results reveal that the 2.0-1.5 and 0.5-0 ka periods had higher sediment deposition rates than in 1.5-1.0 and 1.0-0.5 ka, with maximum value about two times that of the minimum. A comparison with historical records of flooding and drought events indicates that a wetter climate led to a higher sediment deposition, reflecting the role of fluvial discharge in delta growth. However, the highest sediment deposition (205 +/- 29 x 10(6) m(3)/a) over the last 500 years is not only related to the wetter conditions of the Little Ice Age, but also linked to dramatic regional population growth. We suggest that human activities have predominated over natural forcing in determining the deltaic growth over the last five centuries. Taking the Medieval Climate Anomaly with the lowest deposition volume as an analog of current climate warming, and considering the decline in sediment loads due to recent damming and soil conservation, the YRD is likely to face an even more severe deficit in sediment supply and higher risk of delta destruction in the coming centuries.

Besides structural measures to mitigate flood risk, non-structural measures are known to be highly effective and low-cost. Such non-structural measures include Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS). Effective warning creation and dissemination are crucial to successful FEWS. Despite extensive bodies of research that cross the boundaries between disciplines and application domains, systematic understanding of the detailed aspects contributing to the effectiveness of flood warnings is lacking. We systematically review the state-of-the-art in risk perception and warning communication present in academic (and grey) literature for FEWS. We focus on the elements of risk warnings specifically, rather than reviewing the topic of risk communication in general. We start with exploring how personal attributes affect individual risk perception related to flood warnings. We then deconstruct flood warnings into three basic components: content, format and dissemination channel. Most importantly, we found 21 individual elements (options) for these components, each associated with varying levels of support for their effectiveness in literature. Important caveats were identified, such as a lack of research into the speech format and SMS channel. We then describe and visualise the warning creation process, providing a framework for guidance. Accelerating technological advancement necessitates continued research into the effectiveness of novel formats and channels, rendering the currently most widely supported and researched elements increasingly obsolete. Further research is needed to explore the complex interplay between elements, i.e., how do different combinations impact effectiveness? Finally, little is known about the transferability of our findings to Africa, Asia and South America, as industrialised countries dominate the research. We hope our findings will contribute to improved understanding, and support the practice of creating effective flood warnings.

However, this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather, potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures. In the present study, peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the UK are analysed using both stationary and non-stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) framework. Nine candidate covariates are used for non-stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non-stationarity in each flood series. Very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends, which suggests that time-varying non-stationary flood models may not always be suitable, and the use of physically-based covariates can provide better-fitting models. In particular, the non-stationary models using rainfall-related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations, thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding. Moreover, two atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic Pattern, were found to be closely related to the non-stationarity of flooding at a number of stations. Unlike rainfall, however, the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant; hence, they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple-covariate non-stationary model. Besides, a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally. For the majority of stations (70%), the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non-stationary model than the use of a single covariate.

J	Müller, J; Joos, F				Mueller, Jurek; Joos, Fortunat			Global peatland area and carbon dynamics from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present - a process-based model investigation	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							NORTHERN PEATLANDS; HOLOCENE PEATLAND; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2 EMISSIONS; CYCLE CHANGES; SYSTEM MODEL; LAND-USE; ACCUMULATION; AMERICA	Peatlands are an essential part of the terrestrial carbon cycle and the climate system. Understanding their history is key to understanding future and past land-atmosphere carbon fluxes. We performed transient simulations over the last 22 000 years with a dynamic global peat and vegetation model forced by Earth system model climate output, thereby complementing data-based reconstructions for peatlands. Our novel results demonstrate a highly dynamic evolution with concomitant gains and losses of active peatland areas. Modeled gross area changes exceed net changes several fold, while net peat area increases by 60% over the deglaciation. Peatlands expand to higher northern latitudes in response to warmer and wetter conditions and retreating ice sheets, and they are partly lost in midlatitude regions. In the tropics, peatlands are partly lost due to the flooding of continental shelves and are regained through nonlinear responses to the combined changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO2. Large north-south shifts of tropical peatlands are driven by shifts in the position of the intertropical convergence zone associated with the abrupt climate events of the glacial termination. Time slice simulations for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) demonstrate large uncertainties in modeled peatland extent (global range from 1.5 to 3.4 Mkm(2), million square kilometers) stemming from uncertainties in climate forcing. The net uptake of atmospheric CO2 by peatlands, modeled at 351 GtC since the LGM, considers decay from former peatlands. Carbon uptake would be misestimated, in particular during periods of rapid climate change and subsequent shifts in peatland distribution, when considering only changes in the area of currently active peatlands. Our study highlights the dynamic nature of peatland distribution and calls for an improved understanding of former peatlands to better constrain peat carbon sources and sinks.

J	Oh, SG; Sushama, L				Oh, Seok-Geun; Sushama, Laxmi			Short-duration precipitation extremes over Canada in a warmer climate	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Short-duration precipitation extreme; P-T relationship; Climate change; Canada; Global environment multiscale (GEM) model	MULTISCALE GEM MODEL; NORTH-AMERICA; CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; PART I; INTENSITY; FREQUENCY; RAINFALL; WEATHER; SCALE	Short-duration precipitation extremes are widely used in the design of engineering infrastructure systems and they also lead to high impact flash flood events and landslides. Better understanding of these events in a changing climate is therefore critical. This study assesses characteristics of short-duration precipitation extremes of 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-h durations in terms of the precipitation-temperature (P-T) relationship in current and future climates for ten Canadian climatic regions using the limited area version of the global environment multiscale (GEM) model. The GEM simulations, driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis and two coupled global climate models (CanESM2 and MPI-ESM), reproduce the general observed regional P-T relationship characteristics in current climate (1981-2010), such as sub-CC (Clausius-Clapeyron) and CC scalings for the coastal and northern, and inland regions, respectively, albeit with some underestimation. Analysis of the transient climate change simulations suggests important shifts and/or extensions of the P-T curve to higher temperature bins in future climate (2071-2100) for RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, particularly for 1-h duration. Analysis of the spatial patterns of dew point depression (temperature minus dew point temperature) and convective available potential energy (CAPE) corresponding to short-duration precipitation extremes for different temperature bins show their changing relative importance from low to high temperature bins. For the low-temperature bins, short-duration precipitation extremes are largely due to high relative humidity, while for high-temperature bins, strong convection due to atmospheric instability brought by surface warming is largely responsible. The analysis thus addresses some of the key knowledge gaps related to the behavior of P-T relationship and associated mechanisms for the Canadian regions.

However, several of these barriers also align with major floodplains. The Carpentarian Barrier in the Gulf Plains (GUP) - one of Australia's most significant biogeographic barriers - experiences extreme floods on a sub-decadal timescale. These floods rise suddenly, cover thousands of square kilometres to a depth of several metres and can take weeks to subside. We investigated whether these floods have shaped community composition. If this is the case, species that are particularly vulnerable to extreme flooding - understorey animals and woody plants, particularly shrubs - should be under-represented, and grasslands should be over-represented on GUP floodplains. We used Akaike selection of logistic models to assess influence of floodplains and other potential drivers on grassland distribution and shrub abundance, and on representation of understorey fauna. We also compared post-flood faunal records with the bioregional data set to assess influence of the 2009 flood on representation of understorey reptiles. Grasslands and shrub-free vegetation were significantly over-represented and understorey fauna significantly under-represented on floodplains, even when the influences of other factors were taken into account. Understorey Gekkota were absent from - and understorey skinks under-represented in - recently flooded areas. Hence, floods appear to have shaped community composition on GUP floodplains by selectively displacing and/or destroying woody plants - particularly shrubs - and understorey animals. Our findings demonstrate association rather than causality, but show that further examination of the ecological and biogeographic impacts of extreme flooding is warranted. Influence of floods on the Australian biota should be considered an ongoing ecological and evolutionary driver, and one that is likely to intensify as extreme floods are expected to become more frequent under climate change.

However, it is widely recognized that well intended intervention to address one of these sustainability objectives in isolation can undermine other objectives. This paper presents a framework to efficiently identify spatial development strategies that provide the best outcomes against multiple objectives. The framework has been applied to London (UK) to identify strategies that can simultaneously: (i) minimize exposure to future heat wave events; (ii) minimize the risk from flood events; (iii) minimize transport emissions; (iv) minimize urban sprawl; (v) maximize brownfield development; and, (vi) prevent development of greenspace that is recognized as important to wellbeing. Prioritizing,each objective in isolation leads to considerably different spatial planning structures, exposing conflicts between many objectives. These include tradeoffs between urban heat risk and transport emissions; and also previously undocumented conflicts between minimizing flood and heat risks. Allowing greater flexibility in development density is shown to provide benefits in terms of heat risk reduction, whilst not significantly affecting mitigation objectives. The framework is shown to significantly improve upon the London Spatial Development Strategy for the objectives analyzed. Further analysis identifies optimal spatial strategies to achieve a Low Carbon, Low Risk or Low Density city - however, these cannot be simultaneously maximized. This work shows there are difficult, and often irreconcilable, choices to be made in the spatial planning of sustainable cities. Spatial search and optimization tools strengthen the evidence-base for planning. Rapid identification of development strategies that satisfy, and minimize conflicts between, multiple objectives helps planners to develop strategies that simultaneously improve urban sustainability and reduce the risks from natural hazards.

DESIGN OPTIONS, IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND EVALUATING SUCCESS OF ECOLOGICALLY ENGINEERED SHORELINES	OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 57	Oceanography and Marine Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter							SEA-LEVEL RISE; COASTAL-DEFENSE STRUCTURES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; OCEAN SPRAWL; INTERTIDAL BIODIVERSITY; ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES; LIVING SHORELINES; FLOOD PROTECTION; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES	Human population growth and accelerating coastal development have been the drivers for unprecedented construction of artificial structures along shorelines globally. Construction has been recently amplified by societal responses to reduce flood and erosion risks from rising sea levels and more extreme storms resulting from climate change. Such structures, leading to highly modified shorelines, deliver societal benefits, but they also create significant socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The planning, design and deployment of these coastal structures should aim to provide multiple goals through the application of ecoengineering to shoreline development. Such developments should be designed and built with the overarching objective of reducing negative impacts on nature, using hard, soft and hybrid ecological engineering approaches. The design of ecologically sensitive shorelines should be context-dependent and combine engineering, environmental and socioeconomic considerations. The costs and benefits of ecoengineered shoreline design options should be considered across all three of these disciplinary domains when setting objectives, informing plans for their subsequent maintenance and management and ultimately monitoring and evaluating their success. To date, successful ecoengineered shoreline projects have engaged with multiple stakeholders (e.g. architects, engineers, ecologists, coastal/port managers and the general public) during their conception and construction, but few have evaluated engineering, ecological and socioeconomic outcomes in a comprehensive manner. Increasing global awareness of climate change impacts (increased frequency or magnitude of extreme weather events and sea level rise), coupled with future predictions for coastal development (due to population growth leading to urban development and renewal, land reclamation and establishment of renewable energy infrastructure in the sea) will increase the demand for adaptive techniques to protect coastlines. In this review, we present an overview of current ecoengineered shoreline design options, the drivers and constraints that influence implementation and factors to consider when evaluating the success of such ecologically engineered shorelines.

The Clausius-Clapeyron relationship explains the intensification of extreme rainfalls as approximately 7% per one degree warming as atmospheric water holding capacity increases with temperature. Therefore, to prepare for a future warmer climate, we need to develop methodologies to project future rainfall intensities across the range of durations and exceedance probabilities used in engineering design. However, the studies that have investigated changes in extreme rainfalls across Australia have had disparate results and are not spatially or temporally comprehensive - hampering our understanding of changes in extreme rainfalls across different durations and exceedance probabilities.This study investigates the impact of climate change on rainfalls from the annual maximum to the 1 in 100year rainfall across a range of storm durations for the continent of Australia. We find increases in short duration (<1 h) annual maximum rainfall are greater than increases in long duration (>1 h) annual maxima across Australia from 1967 to 2021. These results are consistent regardless of the data period or data set chosen for analysis. We estimate events rarer than the annual maxima through fitting non-stationary Generalize Extreme Value models. We find that events of rarer severity have increased more than frequent events. Further, we identify the parameterisation of a model with non-stationary location and scale parameters to capture the changes in historic design quantiles that are consistent with our physical understanding of rainfall intensification, empirical quantile changes, and historical trends. We conclude that trends in annual maxima are best represented by non-stationary models that incorporate changes in both location and scale parameters, not by solely varying either location or scale parameters.

It is critical for water quality management to understand the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus stratification and its driving forces. In this study, high-frequency total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from January 2017 to October 2019 were estimated using the datasets of high-frequency buoy parameters, including water temperature, pH, chlorophyll-a, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. The results revealed that both nitrogen and phosphorus in water column were periodically stratified. Specifically, the stratification of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred from April to December or January of the following year. Moreover, indices of TN stratification (IC-TN) and TP stratification (IC-TP) were - 0.29 similar to 0.05 and - 0.78 similar to 0.28, respectively. Significant (P < 0.01) positive correlations were observed between RWCS (an index of thermal stability) and IC-TN (or IC-TP), indicating thermal stratification may be the main driving force of nutrient stratification at inter-month scales. Further analysis indicated that the thermal stratification may affect nitrogen and phosphorus stratification though (1) influencing algal growth and (2) affecting the release of internal sources and the material exchange between water columns. Furthermore, precipitation is also suggested as an important factor affecting the stability of nitrogen and phosphorus vertical profile in the flood season. These findings may provide important information for optimizing water quality management efforts in Qiandaohu and other subtropical deep reservoirs. In addition, the knowledge of the effect of temperature and precipitation on nutrient stratification are essential to understand future ecosystem dynamics of deep reservoirs.

A peculiar case was the impact of Medicane Zorbas in September 2018 along the coasts of south-eastern Sicily, where it caused inland flooding and damages to the socio-economic activities. Here, Zorbas effects are reconstructed through post-event geomorphological surveys, interviews with direct witness and analyses of video recorded by surveillance systems or found in social media. These data allowed us to assess the flooding extent on seven coastal sectors located between Thapsos Peninsula and Marzamemi. Flooding caused by Zorbas appears to be greater than those produced by the main seasonal storms affecting the areas from 2015 to 2019; nevertheless, it is comparable with the flooding generated by Medicane Qendresa that impacted south-eastern Sicily in 2014. Wave propagation and extreme water level modelling, performed for the main storm events that occurred in the area since 2005, and analyses of data recorded by tide gauges of Catania, Porto Palo di Capo Passero and Malta since 2008, showed that Medicanes generate greater flooding than seasonal storms because they can induce higher and longer surge along the coastline. Collected data indicated that the surge generated by Zorbas reached a maximum value between about 0.8 m and 1.2 m above mean sea level (msl) along the coast of south-eastern Sicily. Results highlighted the need to better evaluate the coastal hazard related to the propagation of Medicanes, especially in the context of future climate change when these events will probably be characterized by longer duration and greater intensity than at the present.

Submerged macrophytes are prominent components of shallow lakes, predicting their response to WLF is therefore crucial for the management and conservation of these valuable and vulnerable ecosystems. We conducted an experiment in 15 outdoor mesocosms to explore the influence of WLF on the performance ofVallisneria spinulosa. We subjectedV. spinulosato WLF of two amplitudes and two frequencies, with stable water level as a control, and measured variations in 20 traits related with growth, sexual and asexual reproduction and resource allocation. Generally, compared with the control plants, fluctuations in water level adversely affected macrophyte biomass and growth, but increased both height and specific leaf area, which are helpful for adaptation ofV. spinulosato high-water level periods. Changes in the WLF frequency had little effect on the growth and reproduction ofV. spinulosaplants apart from their leaf mass. In contrast, increased amplitude not only inhibited aboveground and root growth ofV. spinulosa, but also decreased investment in sexual reproduction by influencing fruit production.V. spinulosaheld a relatively stable allocation to overwintering asexual propagules in response to both components of WFL, which can maintain a capacity for clonal propagation following WLF. Moreover, as WLF amplitude increased,V. spinulosainvested a higher fraction of resources to belowground mass at the expense of their allocation to leaf mass. Our results suggest that shifts in WFL and especially magnified WLF amplitude due to climate change, may severely affect the growth and reproduction of submerged macrophytes with implications for other biota and the ecological state of shallow lakes.

At global scale there is limited understanding of these issues with respect to the warming targets stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Here we use a well-established hydrological model (Variable Infiltration Capacity [VIC]) forced with a representative ensemble of latest climate projections from four global circulation models (GCMs) to estimate potential future changes in runoff and Terrestrial Ecosystem Water Retention (TEWR), as well as changes in extreme runoff and their impacts on population, and overall gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide. Results suggest that annual runoff generally would have larger increases, while annual TEWR generally would have larger decreases under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario as opposed to 1.5 degrees C warming scenario. Global mean warming of 2 degrees C versus 1.5 degrees C would lead to more distinct spatial patterns in runoff change, with a general shift of the runoff distribution towards more extreme low runoff in Mexico, western United States, Western Europe, southeastern China, West Siberian Plain and more extreme high runoff in Alaska, northern Canada, and large parts of Asia. More people and GDP would be exposed to extreme low runoff decrease, extreme high runoff increase, extreme low runoff decrease as well as extreme high runoff increase under a higher warming scenario. This study differentiates hydrological impacts between the two warming scenarios and illustrates higher runoff, lower TEWR, larger potential drought and flood hazards and adverse impacts on population and GDP under 2 degrees C than 1.5 degrees C.

The hydrologic model DRAINMOD was used to simulate soil water balance with drain spacing of 7 and 14 m, different initial groundwater Table 40, 60 and 80 cm b.s.l., and dates at the beginning of control drainage of 1 March, 15 March, 1 April, and 15 April. The CD restricts flow at the drain outlet to maintain a water table during the growing season. Simulations were made for the periods from March to September for the years 2014, 2017, and 2018, which were average, wet, and dry, respectively. The simulations showed a significant influence of the initial groundwater tables and date blocking the outflow from the drainage network on the obtained results. In the conditions of central Poland, the use of CD is rational only when it is started between 1 and 15 March. In this case, the groundwater table can be increased from 10 to 33 cm (7 m spacing) and from 10 to 41 cm (14 m spacing) in relation to the conventional system (free drainage-FD). In the case of blocking the outflow on 1 March, the reduction is about 80% on average in the period from March to September. With a delay in blocking the outflow, the impact of CDs decreases and ranges from 8% to 50%. Studies have shown that the proper use of the drainage network infrastructure complies with the idea of sustainable development, as it allows efficient water management, by reduction of the outflow and, thus, nitrates from agricultural areas. Furthermore, CD solutions can contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change on agriculture by reducing drought and flood risk.

Simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city. In that light, this study aims to (a) study the 2015 Chennai flood event and (b) simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future, considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects. The baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic (HEC-HMS)-hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models and the results are validated with observed flood-mark data. Historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an Artificial Neural Network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios. The hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs, which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns. The simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely, and that taken together with extreme rainfall, are 20 and 33 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis shows that on an average 1.7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario. This study, therefore, demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl, in addition to changes in rainfall, for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city. Considering the uncertainties involved in the study, the presented results may be considered as "what-if' scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of Chennai.	[Devi, N.

Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) - measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems - for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program - Horizon 2020 - international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally.

Geomorphic control on regional glacier lake outburst flood and debris flow activity over northern Tien Shan	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						GLOF; Debris flow; Cryosphere; Tree rings; Dendrogeomorphology; Tien Shan; Kyrgyzstan	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; MASS MOVEMENTS; WOOD ANATOMY; RECONSTRUCTION; MOUNTAINS; LANDSLIDE; HAZARDS; RETREAT	Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and related debris flows (DF) are significant natural threats in the Tien Shan Mountains. Their occurrence is favoured by the formation of new glacier lakes and the destabilization of moraines and hillslopes due to climate warming. Understanding the frequency-magnitude of these processes is essential for the implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction strategies. Yet, long-term records of past GLOFs or DF in the region are almost completely missing, which renders rational hazard and risk assessments difficult. Here, we present a unique, multi-century dataset of regional GLOF-DF reconstruction for the Tien Shan based on tree ring analyses from six different torrential fans, and provide insights on regional processes activity. Based on this dataset, we also test whether GLOF-DF activity is related to glacier degradation and changes in geomorphic characteristics at the catchment scale. Results from > 430 disturbed trees growing on six different DF fans suggest frequent GLOF-DF activity since the 19th century, which is consistent with available historical records. We also observe an increase in process activity during the mid-20th century coinciding with phases of glacier stagnation or even slight glacier advances. This means GLOF-DF activity in northern Tien Shan is inversely related to moraine-glacier ratios as well as to glacier area shrinkage rates and fan characteristics (such as slope and depositional area). These findings imply that glaciological and geomorphic features could be used for regional susceptibility assessments in the future. Results presented here are the longest, annually resolved GLOF-DF series in the region, if not worldwide, and constitute a unique dataset to understand process variability. As such, they should be used for further climate change adaptation to mitigate natural hazard and risk in the region.

Salt marshes for flood risk reduction: Quantifying long-term effectiveness and life-cycle costs	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Salt marsh; Flood risk; Sea level rise; Nature-based solutions; Life-cycle costs	SEA-LEVEL RISE; WAVE ATTENUATION; TIDAL MARSH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; EROSION; RESILIENCE; PROTECTION; MANAGEMENT; DEFENSES	Flood risks are increasing worldwide due to climate change and ongoing economic and demographic development in coastal areas. Salt marshes can function as vegetated foreshores that reduce wave loads on coastal structures such as dikes and dams, thereby mitigating current and future flood risk. This paper aims to quantify long-term (100 years) flood risk reduction by salt marshes. Dike-foreshore configurations are assessed by coupled calculations of wave energy dissipation over the foreshore, sediment accretion under sea level rise, the probability of dike failure, and life-cycle costs. Rising sea levels lead to higher storm waves, and increasing probabilities of dike failure by wave overtopping. This study shows that marsh elevation change due to sediment accretion mitigates the increase in wave height, thereby elongating the lifetime of a dike-foreshore system. Further, different human interventions on foreshores are assessed in this paper: realization of a vegetated foreshore via nourishment, addition of a detached earthen breakwater, addition of an unnaturally high zone, or foreshore build-up by application of brushwood dams that enhance sediment accretion. The performance of these strategies is compared to dike heightening for the physical boundary conditions at an exposed dike along the Dutch Wadden Sea. Cost-effectiveness depends on three main factors. First, wave energy dissipation, which is lower for salt marshes with a natural elevation in the intertidal zone, when compared to foreshores with a high zone or detached breakwater. Second, required costs for construction and maintenance. Continuous maintenance costs and delayed effects on flood risk make sheltering structures less attractive from a flood risk perspective. Third, economic value of the protected area, where foreshores are particularly cost-effective for low economic value. Concluding, life-cycle cost analysis demonstrates that, within certain limits, foreshore construction can be more cost-effective than dike heightening.

Future hydroclimatological changes in South America based on an ensemble of regional climate models	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Hydroclimate of South America; Climate change; Budyko space; Aridity index; Regional climate models	LA PLATA BASIN; COUPLED MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; RESOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; ARIDITY; TRENDS; CYCLE	Changes between two time slices (1961-1990 and 2071-2100) in hydroclimatological conditions for South America have been examined using an ensemble of regional climate models. Annual mean precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E) and potential evapotranspiration (E-P) are jointly considered through the balances of land water and energy. Drying or wetting conditions, associated with changes in land water availability and atmospheric demand, are analysed in the Budyko space. The water supply limit (E limited by P) is exceeded at about 2% of the grid points, while the energy limit to evapotranspiration (E=E-P) is overall valid. Most of the continent, except for the southeast and some coastal areas, presents a shift toward drier conditions related to a decrease in water availability (the evaporation rate E/P increases) and, mostly over much of Brazil, to an increase in the aridity index (? = E-P/P). These changes suggest less humid conditions with decreasing surface runoff over Amazonia and the Brazilian Highlands. In contrast, Argentina and the coasts of Ecuador and Peru are characterized by a tendency toward wetter conditions associated with an increase of water availability and a decrease of aridity index, primarily due to P increasing faster than both E and E-P. This trend towards wetter soil conditions suggest that the chances of having larger periods of flooding and enhanced river discharges would increase over parts of southeastern South America. Interannual variability increases with ? (for a given time slice) and with climate change (for a given aridity regimen). There are opposite interannual variability responses to the cliamte change in Argentina and Brazil by which the variability increases over the Brazilian Highlands and decreases in central-eastern Argentina.

However, neither traditional descriptive statistics nor curving-fitting methods can fully address its complexity. We selected the Greater Khingan Range in northeastern China as the study area and used parameterized end-member analysis (EMA) of the GSD of four drilling cores to extract different end-member (EM) components. The results show that EM1 (mode particle size (Mo): 1.26-1.66 mu m) originates from weathering and pedogenesis. The EMs with Mo values of 4.37-5.01 mu m represent components transported by the upper westerly wind. EMs with Mo values of 7.58 mu m and 11.48 mu m represent wet dust deposition and dry dust deposition. The wind transport of particles in winter consists of low-level near-source transport and local-source transport (possibly from the flood plain of the Amur River). Due to the limitations of the EM model, the two sources have one or two EM components: AEM3 + AEM4, BEM3 + BEM4, CEM4, and DEM4. DEM5 is the only large particle-size component and may represent coarse-grained detritus generated via rock weathering. The components related to the winter monsoon and the 14C dating data suggest a weak-strong-weak-strong trend of the winter monsoon since the Marine Isotope Stage 3a (MIS 3a). Our results suggest that the strengthening of the winter monsoons in the previous few thousand years has caused the transportation of coarser grain sizes and further exacerbated permafrost degradation, providing a scientific reference for understanding climate change and the formation and evolution of permafrost in the Greater Khingan Mountains since the MIS 3a.

Planning for these changes requires making projections, even in the face of considerable uncertainties, to make informed man-agement and policy decisions. A number of climate change scenarios and projections at global and regional levels are available that can be used to predict the likely range of outcomes. However, there is a need to translate these projec-tions into potential implications for hydrology and water quality. Since there are dozens of hydrologic models, there is a need to evaluate them critically and to develop guidance regarding selecting the appropriate model for a given ob-jective. We conducted a review of 21 different models commonly used for modeling hydrology (8), water quality (6) or both (7) at the watershed scale. Six of the models are strictly water quality models that depend on a separate model or observed data for hydrology. Seven additional models are useful for estimating hydrology and water quality simultaneously. The models were then evaluated based on ten different criteria, including functionality, scope, ability to model extreme events, data requirements, availability, and technical support, among others. The models were ranked Low, Medium or High in each of the criteria. The results indicate that three hydrologic models, MIKE-SHE, HEC-HMS, and MODHMS, as well as two full hydrology and water quality models, SWAT and WARMF, stand out in terms of functionality, availability, applicability to a wide range of watersheds and scales, ease of implementation, and availability of support. Modelers should carefully select the best model for their application, in part guided by the criteria discussed herein.

Carol			Winter runoff events pose an unquantified continental-scale risk of high wintertime nutrient export	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						rain on snow; water quality; climate change; winter; nutrient transport; watershed; runoff	ON-SNOW EVENTS; UNITED-STATES; WATER AVAILABILITY; NITROGEN INPUTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-AMERICA; FROZEN SOIL; PHOSPHORUS; TRENDS; DYNAMICS	Winters in snow-covered regions have warmed, likely shifting the timing and magnitude of nutrient export, leading to unquantified changes in water quality. Intermittent, seasonal, and permanent snow covers more than half of the global land surface. Warming has reduced the cold conditions that limit winter runoff and nutrient transport, while cold season snowmelt, the amount of winter precipitation falling as rain, and rain-on-snow have increased. We used existing geospatial datasets (rain-on-snow frequency overlain on nitrogen and phosphorous inventories) to identify areas of the contiguous United States (US) where water quality could be threatened by this change. Next, to illustrate the potential export impacts of these events, we examined flow and turbidity data from a large regional rain-on-snow event in the United States' largest river basin, the Mississippi River Basin. We show that rain-on-snow, a major flood-generating mechanism for large areas of the globe (Berghuijs et al 2019 Water Resour. Res. 55 4582-93; Berghuijs et al 2016 Geophys. Res. Lett. 43 4382-90), affects 53% of the contiguous US and puts 50% of US nitrogen and phosphorus pools (43% of the contiguous US) at risk of export to groundwater and surface water. Further, the 2019 rain-on-snow event in the Mississippi River Basin demonstrates that these events could have large, cascading impacts on winter nutrient transport. We suggest that the assumption of low wintertime discharge and nutrient transport in historically snow-covered regions no longer holds. Critically, however, we lack sufficient data to accurately measure and predict these episodic and potentially large wintertime nutrient export events at regional to continental scales.

However, many developing countries lack sufficiently detailed data to produce reliable risk maps with existing methods. Thus, improved methods are needed that can help managers and decision makers to combine existing data with more soft semi-subjective data, such as citizen observations of flood-prone and vulnerable areas in view of existing settlements. Thus, we present an innovative approach using the semi-subjective Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which integrates both subjective and objective assessments, to help organize the problem framework. This approach involves measuring the consistency of decision makers' judgments, generating pairwise comparisons for choosing a solution, and considering criteria and sub-criteria to evaluate possible options. An urban flood-risk map was created according to the vulnerabilities and hazards of different urban areas using classification and regression-tree models, and the map can serve both as a first stage in advancing flood-risk mitigation approaches and in allocating warning and forecasting systems. The findings show that machine-learning methods are efficient in urban flood zoning. Using the city Rasht in Iran, it is shown that distance to rivers, urban drainage density, and distance to vulnerable areas are the most significant parameters that influence flood hazards. Similarly, for urban flood vulnerability, population density, land use, dwelling quality, household income, distance to cultural heritage, and distance to medical centers and hospitals are the most important factors. The integrated technique for both objective and semi-subjective data as outlined in the present study shows credible results that can be obtained without complicated modeling and costly field surveys. The proposed method is especially helpful in areas with little data to describe and display flood hazards to managers and decision makers.

Three objectives guide this research: (1) to identify flood prone areas and develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) (e.g., to estimate ecosystem service impacts and economic loss in flood prone areas); (2) to co-develop risk profiles and social vulnerability assessment; and (3) to synthesize assessment outcomes and generate corresponding adaptation plans and recommendations. A knowledge coproduction process was used to link participatory action research (PAR) on social conditions and changes with technical assessments of sea-level rise simulations at 0.5 and 1 m to identify flood prone areas and develop the CVI. Additional data collection and analyses methods include a review of literature and synthesis of expert opinion (n = 5) regarding SLR effects on estimated losses in ecosystem services and community livelihoods, semistructured interviews (n = 50) and focus group discussions (n = 17 people). We find that a co-production process of natural and social science, together with local knowledge, provides a holistic and integrative identification of impacts of sea level rise and community-based adaptation plans and policy. Initial results were synthesized and then presented to multiple stakeholders in a Kohklang community workshop to further clarify findings and confirm insights. This research process has highlighted the significance of transdisciplinary and participatory approaches to developing household- and community-level policy and plans for adaptation to sea level rise. Outcomes of the research include practical recommendations to address vulnerability concerns, as well as a draft adaptation plan for inclusion in the strategy of the sub-district administrative authority.

Egypt, on the southeastern flank of the Mediterranean Sea, is facing many challenges for water and food security, further exacerbated by the arid climate conditions. The Nile River represents the largest freshwater resource for the country, with a minor contribution coming from rainfall and from non-renewable groundwater aquifers. In more recent years, another important source is represented by non-conventional sources, such as treated wastewater reuse and desalination; these water resources are increasingly becoming valuable additional contributors to water availability. Moreover, although rainfall is scarce in Egypt, studies have shown that rainfall and flash floods can become an additional available source of water in the future. While presently rare, heavy rainfalls and flash floods are responsible for huge losses of lives and infrastructure especially in parts of the country, such as in the Sinai Peninsula. Despite the harsh climate, water from these events, when opportunely conveyed and treated, can represent a precious source of freshwater for small communities of Bedouins. In this work, rainfall climatology and flash flood events are presented, together with a discussion about the dynamics of some selected episodes and indications about future climate scenarios. Results can be used to evaluate the water harvesting potential in a region where water is scarce, also providing indications for improving the weather forecast. Basic information needed for identifying possible risks for population and infrastructures, when fed into hydrological models, could help to evaluate the flash flood water volumes at the outlets of the effective watershed(s). This valuable information will help policymakers and local governments to define strategies and measures for water harvesting and/or protection works.

However, relatively lithe is known about the supply and demand of the EFRS at the city scale and about the effect of nature-based solutions on the EFRS. To fill this gap, we present an integrated method to calculate the EFRS supply as the difference between precipitation and runoff using hydrology models and the EFRS demand as the expected flood damages through flood risk analysis. The spatial relationship between the supply and demand of the EFRS is analyzed using spatial statistics. A case study in central Shanghai, China, shows that the total EFRS demand is US$ 1.14 billion for a 100-year pluvial flood, with the demand density decreasing from the west to the east. The total EFRS supply is 2.14 x 10(7)m(3), with the supply density increasing from the center and to the periphery. The EFRS supply and demand are imbalanced, as the demand is relatively higher than the supply in 92 (or 32.86%) catchments. Three of these imbalanced catchments can potentially be satisfied through inter-catchment EFRS sharing from neighboring catchments with abundant supplies of the EFRS. The number of imbalanced catchments can also be reduced to 27-42 by adopting concave green lands. The proposed methods have a broad application in other cities around the world. These findings could facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the EFRS at the city scale and help policy-makers formulate an integrated flood risk management strategy.

Natural hazard threats to pollinators and pollination	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Review						disturbance; ecosystem service; extreme event; extreme weather; natural hazard; pollination; resilience; vulnerability	EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS; FRUIT-SET; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; FLOWERING PLANTS; FIRE; NETWORKS; CONSEQUENCES; AGRICULTURE; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES	Natural hazards are naturally occurring physical events that can impact human welfare both directly and indirectly, via shocks to ecosystems and the services they provide. Animal-mediated pollination is critical for sustaining agricultural economies and biodiversity, yet stands to lose both from present exposure to natural hazards, and future climate-driven shifts in their distribution, frequency, and intensity. In contrast to the depth of knowledge available for anthropogenic-related threats, our understanding of how naturally occurring extreme events impact pollinators and pollination has not yet been synthesized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the potential impacts of natural hazards on pollinators and pollination in natural and cultivated systems. From a total of 117 studies (74% of which were observational), we found evidence of community and population-level impacts to plants and pollinators from seven hazard types, including climatological (extreme heat, fire, drought), hydrological (flooding), meteorological (hurricanes), and geophysical (volcanic activity, tsunamis). Plant and pollinator response depended on the type of natural hazard and level of biological organization observed; 19% of cases reported no significant impact, whereas the majority of hazards held consistent negative impacts. However, the effects of fire were mixed, but taxa specific; meta-analysis revealed that bee abundance and species richness tended to increase in response to fire, differing significantly from the mainly negative response of Lepidoptera. Building from this synthesis, we highlight important future directions for pollination-focused natural hazard research, including the need to: (a) advance climate change research beyond static "mean-level" changes by better incorporating "shock" events; (b) identify impacts at higher levels of organization, including ecological networks and co-evolutionary history; and (c) address the notable gap in crop pollination services research-particularly in developing regions of the world. We conclude by discussing implications for safeguarding pollination services in the face of global climate change.

Modeling residential coastal flood vulnerability using finished-floor elevations and socio-economic characteristics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flood vulnerability; Social sensitivity; Physical exposure; Emergency management	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDEX	Densely populated coastal regions are vulnerable to threats associated with climate change and variability, especially storms. In the United States, millions of people are repeatedly at risk of flooding and because this number will only continue to grow, the identification of the intersection of social vulnerability and physical risk to flood inundation is essential for both coastal planning and adaptation purposes. Although a key tool to identify vulnerable populations, most vulnerability models are built at the county or coarser scales, thereby hindering the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation planning at community scales, which are more socially and physically diverse than what county-scale analyses can reveal. We present an integrated social and physical model of vulnerability at the block-group level of geography using census data to measure social variability based population and housing data and physical exposure based on the intersection of finished floor elevation of all buildings in coastal North Carolina, USA with flood hazards maps. We identify, in a spatially-explicit manner and at multiple levels of governance, areas of high social vulnerability and their intersection with areas of high physical exposure to inundation. We found that in the 28 coastal counties of North Carolina, 45.3% of the structures within the 100-year floodplain were structurally exposed to potential damage from inundation. Supporting our hypothesized patterns of vulnerability to inundation, a significant clustering of highly vulnerable block-groups were located in Albemarle and Eastern Carolina coastal regions, yet high vulnerability outliers were also located at significant distance away from the highly physically-exposed coastline. Our findings suggest that the high-resolution block-group level analysis identified multiple levels of vulnerability to inundation at the sub-county scale and provide essential information for effective hazard mitigation within scales ranging from the community to transboundary governing bodies.

Climate Change and Adaptation in Global Supply-Chain Networks	REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						G15; Q54; G30; F64	TEMPERATURE; SHOCKS; LINKAGES; RISKS	This paper examines how physical climate exposure affects firm performance and global supply chains. We document that heat at supplier locations reduces the operating income of suppliers and their customers. Further, customers respond to perceived changes in suppliers' exposure: when suppliers' realized exposure exceeds ex ante expectations, customers are 7% more likely to terminate supplier relationships. Consistent with experience-based learning, this effect increases with signal strength and repetition and decreases with country-level climate adaptation. Subsequent replacement suppliers show a lower expected and realized but similar projected heat exposure. We find similar results for suppliers' exposure to floods.Authors have furnished an , which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.

Time dependent stored volumes, outflow discharges and mean water depths were computed for a set of 2000 synthetic urban forms, considering various terrain slopes and return periods of the rainfall. An efficient porosity-based surface flow model was used to compute the 2D flow variables. Statistical analysis of the relationship between the flow and urban variables highlights that the flooding severity is mostly influenced by the building coverage.

Major flooding factors in coastal areas can be classified as storm surges, river inundation, and inland submergence. Because previous studies usually applied a linear sum of individual inundation components to predict comprehensive flood phenomena, this approach does not consider weighted effects associated with the simultaneous occurrence of complex flooding. In this study, a series of comprehensive flood simulations were performed using two numerical models: HDM-2D and FLUval Modeling ENgine (FLUMEN). The results revealed that an integrated flood analysis considering the effects of inundation flooding, river flooding, and coastal flooding required evaluation of the risk of flooding in coastal cities.

Drought and Human Mobility in Africa	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate change adaptation; extreme events; human mobility; urbanization	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIGRATION; RISK; EXPOSURE; FLOODS	Human mobility from droughts is multifaceted and depends on environmental, political, social, demographic and economic factors. Although droughts cannot be considered as the single trigger, they significantly influence people's decision to move. Yet, the ways in which droughts influence patterns of human settlements have remained poorly understood. Here we explore the relationships between drought occurrences and changes in the spatial distribution of human settlements across 50 African countries for the period 1992-2013. For each country, we extract annual drought occurrences from two indicators, the international disaster database EM-DAT and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI-12) records, and we evaluate human settlement patterns by considering urban population data and human distance to rivers, as derived from nighttime lights. We then compute human displacements as variations in human distribution between adjacent years, which are then associated with drought (or non-drought) years. Our results show that drought occurrences across Africa are often associated with (other things being equal) human mobility toward rivers or cities. In particular, we found that human settlements tend to get closer to water bodies or urban areas during drought conditions, as compared to non-drought periods, in 70%-81% of African countries. We interpret this tendency as a physical manifestation of drought adaptation, and discuss how this may result into increasing flood risk or overcrowding urban areas. As such, our results shed light on the interplay between human mobility and climate change, bolstering the analysis on the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought risks in a warming world. Prolonged water shortages induced by droughts can have severe consequences on both the environment and society. For instance, the mobility of people can be influenced by drought events. In order to test this assumption, we relate the movement of people to drought occurrences, without considering any additional factor. We focus on Africa, since it is one of the most drought-prone continents and the movement of people is more prominent compared to other areas. We find that people tend to move closer to rivers and to urban centers during droughts, as compared to non-drought periods. This pattern is found for the majority of African countries, which suggests a large-scale signal. The increased movement of people toward rivers during droughts might generate larger human losses if flood events take place in the future. A new methodology integrating satellite data is developed for evaluating drought-induced human displacements in AfricaWe found that 70%-81% of African countries exhibit larger displacements during droughts, as compared to non-drought periodsHuman displacement toward rivers and urban centers is triggered, other things being equal, by drought occurrences	[Ceola, S.] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Bologna, Italy; [Mard, J.; Di Baldassarre, G.] Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Mard, J.; Di Baldassarre, G.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci Air Water & Landscape Sci, Uppsala, Sweden	University of Bologna; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University	Ceola, S (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Bologna, Italy.	serena.ceola@unibo.it	Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/C-7304-2009	Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/0000-0002-8180-4996	European Research Council [D.D. 1243 2/8/2022, PE00000005]; European Union Next-GenerationEU [771678]; European Research Council (ERC)	European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union Next-GenerationEU(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)	This work was developed within the activities of the working group Drought in the Anthropocene of the Panta Rhei research initiative of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences.

The present study determines the implications of the morphological changes that occurred along the Paglia River in the last 200 years on the distribution of Hg along the floodplain and riverbed, which today represent one of the main Hg-reservoirs in the MAMD. Materials and methods The temporal changes of the Paglia riverbed and the extent of its alluvial deposits were reconstructed by a GIS-based analysis of the available maps and aerial photos. The Hg-concentration in soil and sediment samples, collected along five transects transverse to the Paglia River channel, was determined by ICP-MS. Results and discussion Samples along the investigated Paglia River segment typically show Hg-contents exceeding the Italian threshold for residential and public green soil use (1 mg kg(-1)). The distribution of Hg in the Paglia floodplain results from the combination of exceedance of sediment yield to the river during mining activities, that fed the floodplain with large amounts of Hg-contaminated sediments during its braided stage about 100 years ago, and the morphological changes of the river, that led to the evolution from a braided to the present-day single channel river. The magnitude of the extension of Hg-contamination, the river geomorphologic changes, and the processes of transport, deposition, and re-suspension did not allow a natural "clean up" of the river system, which shows a low resilience. Under high flow conditions, and especially in coincidence with intense rain events, large amounts of Hg stored in the overbank sediments are mobilized and redistributed, contributing to make the floodplain a secondary Hg-source. Extreme weather events, expected to intensify as a consequence of climate change, will contribute to the recurrent distribution of Hg-contaminated legacy sediments in the floodplain and along the Paglia river course. Conclusion From a water/land management perspective, the variability of the river flow, associated with an increase of extreme flood events driven by climate change, will affect the distribution of Hg-contaminated particles in the Paglia River, contributing to the Hg input into the Mediterranean Sea in the future.

The swift advancement of glacial lake identification techniques offers a pivotal perspective for forecasting and mitigating the perils of glacial lake outburst disasters.MethodsTo evaluate the thematic evolution, research focal points, and forthcoming directions within the glacier identification domain, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted on glacial lake identification-related literature from 1991 to 2023 in the Web of Science Core Collection database.Results1) The United States, the United Kingdom, and China stand as principal nations propelling the field's advancement. The Chinese Academy of Sciences demonstrates the highest activity in terms of article publications and international collaborations. 2) Climate change, compilation of glacial lake inventories, methodologies for risk assessment, glacial lake outburst floods, comprehensive disaster management strategies, and hydrodynamic models constitute the domain's research hotspots. It is a typical multidisciplinary field. 3) Persistently high-impact topics over an extended period include "hazard", "Late Pleistocene", "environmental change", "ice sheet", and "lake sediments". Keywords indicating the present cutting-edge research encompass "inventory", "glacial lake outburst flood", "risk", "dynamics", "Tibetan Plateau", "evolution", and "high mountain Asia".DiscussionThis paper delves into the current status and pivotal concerns of glacial lake identification techniques, methodologies, and the scale of identification research themes. Further Research should concentrate on avenues like "recognition methods grounded in machine learning and deep learning", "multisource data fusion datasets", "novel algorithms and technologies adaptable to scale transformation and data expansion", as well as "enhancing spatiotemporal data resolution". This will ultimately enable precise, prolonged, and multiscalar identification of glacial lakes. his study provides valuable guidance and reference for future research in the field of glacial lake identification.

After the event, a hydrological assessment and a probabilistic event attribution analysis of rainfall data were initiated and complemented by discussing the vulnerability and exposure context. The global mean surface temperature (GMST) served as a covariate in a generalised extreme value distribution fitted to observational and model data, exploiting the dependence on GMST to estimate how anthropogenic climate change affects the likelihood and severity of extreme events. Rainfall accumulations in Ahr/Erft and the Belgian Meuse catchment vastly exceeded previous observed records. In regions of that limited size the robust estimation of return values and the detection and attribution of rainfall trends are challenging. However, for the larger Western European region it was found that, under current climate conditions, on average one rainfall event of this magnitude can be expected every 400 years at any given location. Consequently, within the entire region, events of similar magnitude are expected to occur more frequently than once in 400 years. Anthropogenic climate change has already increased the intensity of the maximum 1-day rainfall event in the summer season by 3-19%. The likelihood of such an event to occur today compared to a 1.2 degrees C cooler climate has increased by a factor of 1.2-9. Models indicate that intensity and frequency of such events will further increase with future global warming. While attribution of small-scale events remains challenging, this study shows that there is a robust increase in the likelihood and severity of rainfall events such as the ones causing extreme impacts in July 2021 when considering a larger region.

Streamflow originating from precipitation and snowmelt and different tributaries can superimpose and cause high water levels, threatening cities and communities along the riverbanks. For better understanding the mechanisms (origin and composition) of flood events in large and complex basins, we capture and share the story behind major historic and projected streamflow peaks in the Rhine River basin. Our analysis is based on hydrological simulations with the mesoscale Hydrological Model forced with both meteorological observations and an ensemble of climate projections. The spatio-temporal analysis of the flood events includes the assessment and mapping of antecedent liquid precipitation, snow cover changes, generated and routed runoff, areal extents of events, and the above-average runoff from major sub-basins up to 10 days before a streamflow peak. We introduce and assess the analytical setup by presenting the flood genesis of the two well-known Rhine floods that occurred in January 1995 and May 1999. We share our extensive collection of event-based Rhine River flood genesis, which can be used in- and outside the scientific community to explore the complexity and diversity of historic and projected flood genesis in the Rhine basin. An interactive web-based viewer provides easy access to all major historic and projected streamflow peaks at four locations along the Rhine. The comparison of peak flow genesis depending on different warming levels elucidates the role of changes in snow cover and precipitation characteristics in the (pre-)Alps for flood hazards along the entire channel of the Rhine. Furthermore, our results suggest a positive correlation between flood magnitudes and areal extents of an event. Further hydro-climatological research is required to improve the understanding of the climatic impact on the Rhine and beyond.

The recent climatic changes have brought a rise in both flood frequency and intensity making this phenomenon more devastating to people. Especially, the riparian communities of Jamalpur along the Jamuna river suffer at least once every year accounting for this natural hazard. In a scenario like this, precaution is a crucial task to fight against this natural phenomenon. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the flood vulnerable zones of Jamalpur district situating beside Jamuna river with a multi-criteria analysis. Assessment of flood vulnerability included consideration of physical indicators like rainfall, drainage density, distance from river, slope, land use land cover, elevation, soil classes as well as social indicators like population density, female density, literacy rate, number of shelters, unmetalled road and number of health personnel. All these parameters were analyzed in Geographic Information System (GIS) and assigned weightage with a multicriteria decision-making technique namely- Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Finally, a flood vulnerability map was generated for the seven Upazilas of Jamalpur district. Very high, high, moderate and low vulnerable zones were identified after overlaying all physical and social indicator maps under consideration. 45.96% portion of a total of 2115.2 sq. Km. Area was under very high and highly vulnerable zones in the final vulnerability map of Jamalpur. Such type of assessment process is significant for flood mitigation projects with a view to providing the greatest concern to the most vulnerable zones. The vulnerability maps can also help the policymakers to provide emergency aids and other privileges to those who are in most need of it.

These lakes may produce outburst floods and transport the huge amount of debris (debris flow) in downstream settlements. The present study addresses the current knowledge on mass movement activity occurred in the Gangotri glacier area, Garhwal Himalaya Uttarakhand. Temporal response (terminus retreat and frontal area loss) of Meru glacier during 1976-2019 using the images of Landsat (MSS, 1976; TM, 1990, 2011; ETM+, 2001; OLI, 2019) and event of intense mass movement occurred along Meru glacier during 2017 is assessed. Our estimations clearly reveals that the Meru glacier is retreating continuously since 1976 with inconsistent rate. Considering the time span 1976-1990, 1990-2001, 2001-2011, 2011-2019 the terminus receded with 12.42 m y(-1), 7.72 m y(-1), 6.00 m y(-1), 11.50 m y(-1) and vacated the frontal area at the rate of 2330.70 m(2) y(-1), 2185.88 m(2) y(-1), 1425.18 m(2) y(-1), 1452.66 m(2) y(-1) respectively. Field observations and high resolution imagery of LISS IV suggest that the lower area of Meru glacier experienced the event of intense mass movement in July, 2017. This event breached the continuity of left morainic wall of Bhagirathi valley. This mass movement event influenced the initial course of Bhagirathi River (similar to 1559 m length) and also modified the morphology of the Gaumukh region. The precipitation data from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and satellite images of different years suggest that the multiple factors such as intense precipitation, large amount of sediment transport from the upper reaches to lower area, slope failure, collapse of frontal part of Meru glacier were the main causative factors for this event.

Evaluation of natural hazard risk for coastal districts of Bangladesh using the INFORM approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Bangladesh; Coastal districts; Natural hazards; Disaster risk; INFORM	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Coastal districts of Bangladesh are increasingly suffering from climatic hazards (e.g., cyclone, flood, saltwater intrusion). Tropical cyclones and floods particularly affect millions of people almost every year. Massive property damages and life losses are a common scenario when these disasters hit the coastal belt. Moreover, due to climate change impact, saltwater intrusion is increasing significantly in the coastal districts, especially during dry seasons impacting crop production and drinking water sources. The amount of asset and population exposed to natural hazards have increased significantly in the coastal belt, which has exacerbated the risk of natural hazards. Previous studies on the disaster risk of coastal districts of Bangladesh did not explicitly account for the key vulnerability and lack of coping capacity parameters that are crucial for a comprehensive risk assessment. This study assesses the disaster risk of 19 coastal districts of Bangladesh using the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) model. The multi-layered INFORM framework particularly assesses the risk of coastal communities considering socioeconomic vulnerabilities and vulnerable groups as well as institutional and infrastructural coping capacity under multiple hazards. Forty-five core risk indicators are used to evaluate the final risk score of the communities. The outcome of the study shows that 11 districts are facing moderate to very high level of risk in the coastal belt. The island district, Bhola, has the highest level of risk among the coastal districts, whereas Cox's Bazar, Chandpur, and Feni districts fall into the lowest risk region. In addition to hazard susceptibility, poverty & development, vulnerable health condition and access to the health care system are key vulnerable factors that potentially increase the overall risk. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for preparing an effective disaster risk mitigation plan by decision-makers.

The approach is piloted on the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) for a one-hundred-year storm event in 2050 under the IPCCs 85 emission scenario (RCP 8,5). Method: Flooding of individual infrastructure was tested against three different digital elevation models using a GIS-based coastal infrastructure database created specifically for the project using aerial images. Inundation for extreme sea levels is based on dynamic simulations using Lisflood-ACC (LFP). Results: The model indicates transport and utility infrastructure in the USVI are considerably exposed to sea level rise and modeled storm impacts from climate change. Prediction of flood extent was improved with a neural network processed SRTM. versus publicly available SRTM (similar to 30 m) seamless C-band DEM but both SRTM based models underestimate flooding compared to UDAR DEM. The modeled scenario, although conservative, showed significant flood exposure to a large number of access roads to facilities, 113/176 transportation related buildings. and 29/66 electric utility and water treatment buildings including six electric power transformers and six waste water treatment clarifiers. Conclusion: The method bridges a gap between large-scale non-specific flood assessments and single-facility detailed assessments and can be used to efficiently quantify and prioritize parcels and large structures in need of further assessment for regions that lack detailed data to assess climate exposure to sea level rise and flooding caused by waves. The method should prove particularly useful for assessment of Small Island Developing State regions that lack LIDAR data, such as the Caribbean. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study characterized the effects of extreme weather events on dissolved organic matter (DOM) washout from watershed soils and the corresponding contribution to disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors under simulated weather conditions. A laboratory simulation was performed to assess the effects of temperature, drought, rainfall intensity, sea level rise, and acid deposition on the amount of DOM released from soil samples. DBP formation potentials (DBPFPs) were obtained to assess the effect of extreme weather events on DBP formation and drinking water quality. The results demonstrated that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and carbonaceous DBP levels increased with increasing temperature in a dry (drought) scenario. Regardless of the watershed from which a soil sample was obtained and the incubation temperature during rewetting or chlorination processes, the DOC and carbonaceous DBP levels also increased with increasing temperature. Brominated DBP formation was increased when bromide was present during the rewetting of soil, indicating the effect of sea level rise. When bromide was present during the chlorination of water for DBPFP tests, only the level of brominated DBPs increased. Acid deposition had various effects under different weather conditions. The results of heavy rainfall simulations suggested that water quality deteriorates at the beginning of an extreme rainfall event. Abundant DOM was washed out of soil, leading to a peak in the DBPFP level. The level of DOM in seepage water was less than that of the surface runoff water during rainfall. The situation was more severe when the rainfall came after a long drought and the drought-rewetting cycle effect occurred. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Projected changes in extreme precipitation events over various subdivisions of India using RegCM4	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Climate change; Extreme precipitation indices; Regional climate model; RCP8.5 scenario	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MONSOON RAINFALL; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; INDEXES; DRY; UNCERTAINTY; CIRCULATION	Present study attempts to project extreme precipitation indices over 34 different meteorological subdivisions and six homogeneous regions such as Northwest, Central Northeast, Northeast, West Central, Peninsular India and Hilly Region during summer monsoon season in the twenty-first century. For this purpose, the Regional Climate Model version4 (RegCM4) had been run at 50 km horizontal resolution forced with the global model GFDL-ESM2 M, during reference period 1976-2005 for the model validation, and the mid- (2031-2060) and far-future (2070-2099) for projections under RCP8.5 scenario over the South Asia CORDEX domain. In this paper, model simulated precipitation has been validated against IMD, APHRODITE and NCEP/NCAR data sets. The results indicate that RegCM4 captures the important features of seasonal precipitation and various extreme indices over the study area. The RegCM4 has projected an increase in the mean seasonal precipitation by 0.56 mm/day whereas in case of GFDL model the rate is 0.39 mm/day during the far-future relative to the reference period. The heavy precipitation indices are projected to increase more frequently (0.264/decade) than the mean precipitation rate (0.01/decade) over India. The correlations between the extreme precipitation indices and the seasonal mean precipitation are found to be strong. In addition, the consecutive dry days are projected to occur more frequently (3-5 days) over West Central (Telangana, Vidarbha and Marathwada) and west Rajasthan while consecutive wet days are projected to decrease over larger parts of India during far-future. Similarly, 1 day maximum precipitation and the simple daily intensity index are projected to increase consistently from mid- to far- futures over some sub-divisions of West coast, Hilly and Northeast regions. From a spatial probability perspective, model projection indicates more frequent severe drought and flood conditions over India.	[Rai, P. K.; Singh, G.

Despite the importance of protecting coastal urbanised areas from flooding and climate-change-induced sea-level rise, the effects of shallow groundwater fluctuations are rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to determine characteristics of shallow groundwater, including spatial and temporal trends in depths to groundwater and their relationship to natural and anthropogenic stressors. The study uses depth to groundwater measurements from a uniquely extensive and densely spaced monitoring network in Otautahi/Christchurch, New Zealand. Data-driven analysis approaches were applied, including spatial interpolation, autocorrelation, clustering, cross-correlation and trend analysis. These approaches are not commonly applied for groundwater assessments despite the potential for them to provide insights and information for city-wide systems. The comprehensive approach revealed discernible clusters and trends within the dataset. Responses to stresses such as rainfall events and stream flow were successfully classified using clustering analysis. The time series analysis indicated that in areas of shallow groundwater, low variation in levels occurred and this was also found using clustering. However, attributing some clusters to specific hydrogeological attributes or stressors posed challenges. The primary feature in hydrograph classification proved to be the proximity to tidal rivers and their correlation with tidal signals. These results highlight the value of using large datasets to characterise spatial and temporal variability of shallow groundwater in urban coastal settings and to assist with monitoring infrastructure planning in the face of future climate-change hazards.

Flood Risk Management via Risk Communication, Cognitive Appraisal, Collective Efficacy, and Community Action	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						community action; flood risk management; information seeking; protection motivation; risk communication	INFORMATION-SEEKING; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SELF-EFFICACY; SOCIAL MEDIA; PERCEPTION; BEHAVIOR; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS; RESPONSES	Climate change and more frequent severe storms have caused persistent flooding, storm surges, and erosion in the northeastern coastal region of the United States. These weather-related disasters have continued to generate negative environmental consequences across many communities. This study examined how coastal residents' exposure to flood risk information and information seeking behavior were related to their threat appraisal, threat-coping efficacy, and participation in community action in the context of building social resilience. A random sample of residents of a coastal community in the Northeastern United States was selected to participate in an online survey (N = 302). Key study results suggested that while offline news exposure was weakly related to flood vulnerability perception, online news exposure and mobile app use were both weakly associated with flood-risk information seeking. As flood vulnerability perception was strongly connected to flood severity perception but weakly linked to lower self-efficacy beliefs, flood severity perception was weakly and moderately associated with response-efficacy beliefs and information seeking, respectively. Furthermore, self-efficacy beliefs, response efficacy beliefs, and flood-risk information seeking were each a weak or moderate predictor of collective efficacy beliefs. Lastly, flood risk information-seeking was a strong predictor and collective efficacy beliefs were a weak predictor of community action for flood-risk management. This study tested a conceptual model that integrated the constructs from risk communication, information seeking, and protection motivation theory. Based on the modeling results reflecting a set of first-time findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Machine Learning Enhances Flood Resilience Measurement in a Coastal Area-Case Study of Morocco	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						resilience; flooding; composite indicators; machine learning; flood resilience index	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; NATURAL DISASTERS; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; HAZARDS; INDEX; PRECIPITATION	Understanding the characteristics contributing to enhancing flood resilience is a matter of urgency in managing urban areas, especially for developing countries, given the challenges imposed by climate change, social growth and urbanization. Identifying resilience metrics remains challenging, mainly because the concept is relatively new, methodological approaches are almost absent, and many types of resilience-related data are still unavailable. A number of indices for flood resilience have been introduced in the literature, typically based on clustering algorithms that allow complex behaviors to be mapped to specific levels of resilience. Consequently, the qualitative aspects of such indices are highly sensitive to the availability, quality and heterogeneity of data. Historically, this assessment has often been performed using rather simple algorithms such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Whilst they allow reliable resilience metrics in some areas, their use in a complex urban system such as the northern coastal area in Morocco is arguable. In the present study, we introduce an advanced Machine Learning (ML) method, namely the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to build a Flood Resilience Index (FRI). Compared to classical methodologies, this present technique allows an improved assimilation of the complex relationship between data representing the social, economic and physical status of the area and resilience level. The success of this approach is mainly due to the ability of SOM to deal with complex, heterogeneous and sparse datasets. The results demonstrate great potential for such algorithms to shed light on systems that are too complex for classical techniques.

In response, this study aimed to explore the factors that influence the vulnerability of coastal communities in Ketu South Municipality, Ghana, to floods. These communities remain vulnerable to coastal flood events from storm surges, high tidal waves, lagoon overflow and heavy rainfall. However, the local conditions that make these communities vulnerable is poorly understood. The study used data from eight (8) in-depth interviews, nine (9) Focus Group Discus-sions and 354-household survey to explore local vulnerability factors in the study area. Results show that factors such as low land elevation, inadequate sea defence structures, high flood fre-quency, large flood extent, long flood duration, flood impacts, are among the exposure factors in-fluencing vulnerability in the study area. It also shows that socioeconomic factors; such as weak demographic groups, low-income levels, low level of education, and some local adaptation mea-sures plus external flood relief supports from National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) influence the vulnerability of the communities. The result further revealed salt produc-tion activities, and relocating to flood prone areas, as well as rise in coastal water table and rapid shoreline erosion are the observable vulnerability factors in the study area whiles gender was a significant social factor influencing flood preparedness. These results can be useful for flood dis-aster management programs.	[Babanawo, Daystar; Mattah, Precious Agbeko D.; Agblorti, Samuel K.

Above- and belowground linkages are responsible for some of the most important ecosystem processes in unmanaged terrestrial systems including net primary production, decomposition, and carbon sequestration. Global change biology is currently altering above- and belowground interactions, reducing ecosystem services provided by natural systems. Less is known regarding how above- and belowground linkages impact climate resilience, especially in intentionally managed cropping systems. Waterlogged or flooded conditions will continue to increase across the Midwestern USA due to climate change. The objective of this paper is to explore what is currently known regarding above- and belowground linkages and how they impact biological, biochemical, and physiological processes in systems experiencing waterlogged conditions. We also identify key above- and belowground processes that are critical for climate resilience in Midwestern cropping systems by exploring various interactions that occur within unmanaged landscapes. Above- and belowground interactions that support plant growth and development, foster multi-trophic-level interactions, and stimulate balanced nutrient cycling are critical for crops experiencing waterlogged conditions. Moreover, incorporating ecological principles such as increasing plant diversity by incorporating crop rotations and adaptive management via delayed planting dates and adjustments in nutrient management will be critical for fostering climate resilience in row-crop agriculture moving forward.

This exposure is exacerbated by the effects of climate change, in particular sea level rise. To contribute to strategic thinking on the vulnerability of coastal areas, it is essential to develop, share and collectively maintain relevant knowledge on risks. This article will present the thinking behind the setting up of a coastal risks observatory in Brittany, a region located in north-western France. It relies on a conceptual approach to systemic vulnerability based on four components: hazards, assets, management, and social representations. Hazards and assets underpin the notion of risk and tend to increase the vulnerability, management tends to mitigate it, and representations can play a part in increasing or decreasing it depending on the context. To understand and analyse this system of vulnerability, our approach is based on the generation of a set of 62 indicators combined into different types of indices. A web-GIS interface was developed to navigate through and map this system of vulnerability. The difficulties associated with this type of synthetic approach will be discussed, whether they are related to data availability, to the links between scientific research and operational territorial management requirements, or to an understanding of the dynamics of all of the vulnerability components and their interactions. Ultimately, the approach developed has been successful in mobilising scientific and operational stakeholders around the co-construction of a diagnosis of territories with regard to their vulnerability to coastal risks.

RAINS FROM SUCCESSIVE HURRICANES REDUCE NESTING SUCCESS OF THE MARBLED SALAMANDER (<i>AMBYSTOMA OPACUM</i>)	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						amphibian decline; climate change; cyclones; developmental plasticity; developmental rate; egg survival; embryo physiology; nesting behavior	AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITIES; FOREST FROGS; DISTURBANCE; IMPACT; VULNERABILITY; SURVIVAL; EMBRYOS; LOUISIANA; PATTERNS; EXTREMES	Current models predict that the intensity of extreme weather will increase as climate change progresses. Indeed, 2020 brought a record number of tropical storms to the Southeastern U.S. The effect of these storms is a conservation concern for amphibians because they depend on aquatic habitats for reproduction. I studied the effect of three subsequent hurricanes on the nesting success of Marbled Salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. In autumn, females migrate to nesting grounds, lay eggs terrestrially and guard them until seasonal rains flood the nest causing eggs to hatch. Rains from Hurricane Sally brought the salamanders into the breeding grounds, but rains from Hurricane Delta drove them back out, leaving the nesting area flooded before eggs could be laid. Most nests were constructed on the periphery of the semi-flooded nesting grounds, and subsequent seasonal rains flooded nests before the eggs were ready to hatch. Rains from Hurricane Zeta maintained high water levels. Of 28 nests, three were successful. Two nests were never covered in water (i.e., 100% egg mortality), and the rest were flooded prematurely. Concomitant lab studies demonstrated that premature flooding of nests reduces hatching success, indicating that increased hurricane frequency can harm salamander populations even if they are relatively far from the coast. Few studies have focused on the effects of hurricanes on salamanders; thus, additional research is warranted because the Southeastern U.S. is a hotspot for both salamander diversity and hurricane activity.

Low-cost adaptation strategies are required to increase resilience and rice productivity in these flood-prone coastal areas. In this study, enriched Azolla extract (EAE) liquid biofertilizers, combined with selected stress-tolerant rice varieties, were tested in farmers' fields in Pangandaran, West Java from June to October 2020. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of EAE in increasing the yield of different rice varieties. The research was arranged as a split-plot design with five replications. The main plot was the EAE application (T1 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost and T2 = 3 ton ha(-1) compost + 10 L ha(-1) of EAE), and the sub-plots were stress-tolerant rice varieties (V1 = Inpari 43, V2 = Mawar, V3 = Inpari 30, V4 = Inpara 03, V5 = Mendawak). The application of EAE of 10 L ha(-1) significantly affected the rice grain yield, which was 37.06% higher than that of the control plot. The average grain yield of the five varieties under EAE treatment (5.51 ton ha(-1)) was greater than the grain yield of local farmers' fields (3.78-4.97 ton ha(-1)). Inpari 43 had the highest grain yield with 5.90 ton ha(-1), but the yield was not significantly different from the Mendawak variety (4.90 ton ha(-1)). This result suggests that EAE and selected stress-tolerant rice varieties (Inpari 43 or Mendawak) are an effective adaptation strategy to increase rice farms' resilience and productivity in coastal areas prone to flooding.

Estimating impacts of recurring flooding on roadway networks: a Norfolk, Virginia case study	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Recurring flooding; Crowd-sourced data; Data predictive model; Impact analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRANSPORTATION; RESILIENCE	Climate change and sea level rise have increased the frequency and severity of flooding events in coastal communities. This study quantifies transportation impacts of recurring flooding using crowdsourced traffic and flood incident data. Agency-provided continuous count station traffic volume data at 12 locations is supplemented by crowd-sourced traffic data from location-based apps in Norfolk, Virginia, to assess the impacts of recurrent flooding on traffic flow. A random forest data predictive model utilizing roadway features, traffic flow characteristics, and hydrological data as inputs scales the spatial extent of traffic volume data from 12 to 7736 roadway segments. Modeling results suggest that between January 2017 and August 2018, City of Norfolk reported flood events reduced 24 h citywide vehicle-hours of travel (VHT) by 3%, on average. To examine the temporal and spatial variation of impacts, crowdsourced flood incident reports collected by navigation app Waze between August 2017 and August 2018 were also analyzed. Modeling results at the local scale show that on weekday afternoon and evening periods, flood-impacted areas experience a statistically significant 7% reduction in VHT and 12% reduction in vehicle-miles traveled, on average. These impacts vary across roadway types, with substantial decline in traffic volumes on freeways, while principal arterials experience increased traffic volumes during flood periods. Results suggest that analyzing recurring flooding at the local scale is more prudent as the impact is temporally and spatially heterogeneous. Furthermore, countermeasures to mitigate impacts require a dynamic strategy that can adapt to conditions across various time periods and at specific locations.	[Praharaj, Shraddha; Chen, T.

Vegetation dynamics of ephemeral and perennial streams in mountainous headwater catchments	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Ephemeral streams; Herb diversity; Biomass; Mountainous areas; Perennial streams; Sri Lanka	WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERMITTENT; FLOOD; LANDSLIDES; HYDROLOGY	Ephemeral and perennial streams of mountainous catchments in Sabaragamuwa Province of Sri Lanka and Hong Kong of China were studied for two years on vegetation dynamics. Each year, sampling was conducted during a period when ephemeral streams had low surface flows. Sampling was realized contiguously using belt transects. The standing crop biomass (hereafter biomass) of herbaceous vegetation in ephemeral channels was comparatively lower than perennials and so was the herb diversity. Herb diversity showed a peak from 1.5 to 4.5 m from the centerline/thalweg of ephemeral and perennial streams. Out of 24 herbs, only three were common for both. A peak herb biomass zone was observed in perennials in the same region where diversity peaked. In ephemerals, herb biomass increased laterally up to similar to 1.5 m, and was constant thereafter. Seedling experiment results tallied with the field diversity observations of both stream types, and suggested that seed dispersion was the main reason for herb colonization. Furthermore, it showed sapling emergence to be significantly higher in perennials than ephemerals. Return period of annual maximum monthly rainfall was a strong indicator of age of trees in ephemeral streams, and elucidated the possibility of hindcasting past flow episodes. Electrical conductivity was significantly high in ephemeral streams among all the water quality parameters. The contents of the water nutrients were approximately the same in both stream types. While recommending further studies on eco-hydrology of ephemerals, we recognize ephemeral streams to be valuable references in climate change studies due to their responsiveness and representativeness in long term hydrological changes.

Even so, floods can be controlled by appropriate measures to minimize loss and damage. Flood risk assessment is an essential analytic step in preventing floods and reducing losses. Identifying previous flood risk and predicting future features are conducive to understanding the changing patterns and laws of flood risk. Taking the Dongjiang River basin as a study case, we assessed and regionalized flood risk in 1990, 2000, and 2010 from the past perspective and explored dynamic expansion during 1990-2010. Then, we projected land-use type, population, and gross domestic product in 2030 and 2050 and finally assessed and regionalized the risk from a future perspective. Results show that areas with very high risk accounted for 14.98-18.08% during 1990-2010; approximately 13.90% areas of the basin transformed from lower-level risk to higher-level risk whereas 9.07% fell from a higher level to a lower level during the period. For the future scenario, areas with very high and high risk in 2030 and 2050 are expected to account for 21.55% and 24.84%, respectively. Generally, our study can better identify changes in flood risk at a spatial scale and reveal the dynamic evolution rule, which provides a synthetical means of flood prevention and reduction, flood insurance, urban planning, and water resource management in the future under global climate change, especially for developing or high-speed urbanization regions.

The Tides They Are A-Changin': A Comprehensive Review of Past and Future Nonastronomical Changes in Tides, Their Driving Mechanisms, and Future Implications	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS			English	Review						tides; mean sea level; tectonics; flooding; erosion	SEA-LEVEL RISE; EXTREME WATER LEVELS; NORTH-SEA; TIDAL DISSIPATION; RIVER DISCHARGE; SECULAR CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OCEAN TIDES; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SEASONAL VARIABILITY	Scientists and engineers have observed for some time that tidal amplitudes at many locations are shifting considerably due to nonastronomical factors. Here we review comprehensively these important changes in tidal properties, many of which remain poorly understood. Over long geological time scales, tectonic processes drive variations in basin size, depth, and shape and hence the resonant properties of ocean basins. On shorter geological time scales, changes in oceanic tidal properties are dominated by variations in water depth. A growing number of studies have identified widespread, sometimes regionally coherent, positive, and negative trends in tidal constituents and levels during the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. Determining the causes is challenging because a tide measured at a coastal gauge integrates the effects of local, regional, and oceanic changes. Here, we highlight six main factors that can cause changes in measured tidal statistics on local scales and a further eight possible regional/global driving mechanisms. Since only a few studies have combined observations and models, or modeled at a temporal/spatial resolution capable of resolving both ultralocal and large-scale global changes, the individual contributions from local and regional mechanisms remain uncertain. Nonetheless, modeling studies project that sea level rise and climate change will continue to alter tides over the next several centuries, with regionally coherent modes of change caused by alterations to coastal morphology and ice sheet extent. Hence, a better understanding of the causes and consequences of tidal variations is needed to help assess the implications for coastal defense, risk assessment, and ecological change.

This was particularly evident in the UK during the winter of 2013-14 when many coastal areas and infrastructure suffered from unprecedented storms, flooding and erosion. Given the value and importance of urban environments, there is a real need to assess the vulnerability of towns and cities on the United Kingdom (UK) coastline on the basis of the latest projected climate scenarios. Accordingly, a modified Physical Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI) was developed in which beach width and coastal slope are considered the most critical physical parameters. The PCVI can be used to rank spatial coastal cells into four classes of vulnerability (from extremely low to high) and to map coastal vulnerability using GIS. As a case study, this approach was applied to the city of Southampton; one of the key port and trade cities in the UK, with results indicating that 38% of the city's coastline is highly vulnerable, and more than 50% moderately vulnerable. The work demonstrates that the methodological framework can be used as a planning tool for coastal management and, based on the availability of suitable data, can be adapted for estuarine or coastal and port environments without any geographical limits. Newly developed coastal vulnerability maps can be used by coastal engineers, managers and other decision makers to implement rigorous shoreline management planning as well as supporting risk, and disaster management policy and procedures.

The structural effects of scour-induced rotation are unaddressed in literature. In this context, a mechanism-based framework based on limit state principles is developed for masonry arch bridges subjected to scour-induced rotation. Critical collapse mechanisms caused by scour-induced rotation are identified, and analysis framework is developed using rigid-body kinematics. The spectrum of bridges under consideration is classified into subsets, and an assessment scheme is developed using fragility curves as a function of scouring location as well as bridge typology.

This paper examines the effects of city deluge as a result of urban assemblage: complex, distributed and disjunctive relations between the city's amphibious ecologies and landscapes, its dilapidated drainage infrastructure, its varied transport systems, its weather patterns, and the movements of people. During cloudbursts, many of Bangkok's missing masses become plainly and frustratingly, visible. Using ethnographic description as a "material diagnostics," I explore how irritated, perturbed, urban atmospheres emerge out of disjunctive infrastructural constellations. Cloudbursts make perceptible such atmospheres as forms of sentient urbanism, in which distributed sensations are generated by intersecting material itineraries moving across multiple assemblages. As affects and agitations move from street level to social media, rain precipitates matters of urgent, urban concern and critique.

This study attempts to incorporate dryness-wetness transitions into the current hazard assessment framework through bivariate frequency analysis and causal attribution from a teleconnection perspective. In the study, regional dry and wet conditions are monitored using the multivariate standardized drought index (MSDI) which facilitates the integrated evaluation of water deficits/surplus from a combined viewpoint of precipitation (largely denoting the received atmospheric water) and runoff (representing an important source of surface water). On such a basis, a copula-based method is subsequently utilized to calculate joint return periods of dryness-wetness combinations in three (i.e., moderate, severe and extreme) severity scenarios. The changing frequency of diverse dryness-wetness combinations is also estimated under a changing climate using a 25-year time window. Furthermore, the cross-wavelet transform is applied to attribute variations in dry and wet conditions to large-scale climate indices, which benefits the early warning of dryness-wetness combinations by providing predictive information. A case study conducted during 1952-2010 in the Huai River basin (HRB)-a typical climatic transition zone in China-shows that the HRB is subject to prolonged dryness with the highest frequency, followed by the abrupt transition from dryness to wetness. Spatially, abrupt dryness-wetness transitions are more likely to occur in the southern and central parts of the HRB than in the rest of the proportion. The past half-century has witnessed the dominantly higher frequency of occurrence of dryness-wetness combinations under three severity scenarios. In particular, the occurrence of the continued dry/wetness escalates more rapidly than transition events under climate change. Moreover, a preliminary attribution analysis discloses the link of the dry and wet conditions in the HRB with climate indices, such as the El Nino southern oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation and the Arctic oscillation, as well as sunspot activities. The results of the study enrich the current atlas of water-related hazards, which may benefit more effective hazard mitigation and adaptation.

However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001-2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 +/- 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 +/- 0.05 m and 1.52 +/- 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km(2) that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years.

The Mediterranean basin is considered a hot spot in terms of climate vulnerability and risk. The expected impacts of those events are exacerbated by land-use change and, in particular, by urban growth which increases soil sealing and, hence, water runoff. The ultimate consequence would be an increase of fatalities and injuries, but also of economic losses in urban areas, commercial and productive sites, infrastructures and agriculture. Flood damages have different magnitudes depending on the economic value of the exposed assets and on level of physical contact with the hazard. This work aims at proposing a methodology, easily customizable by experts' elicitation, able to quantify and map the social component of vulnerability through the integration of earth observation (EO) and census data with the aim of allowing for a multi-temporal spatial assessment. Firstly, data on employment, properties and education are used for assessing the adaptive capacity of the society to increase resilience to adverse events, whereas, secondly, coping capacity, i.e. the capacities to deal with events during their manifestation, is mapped by aggregating demographic and socio-economic data, urban growth analysis and memory on past events. Thirdly, the physical dimension of exposed assets (susceptibility) is assessed by combining building properties acquired by census data and land-surface characteristics derived from EO data. Finally, the three components (i.e. adaptive and coping capacity and susceptibility) are aggregated for calculating the dynamic flood vulnerability index (FVI). The approach has been applied to Northeast Italy, a region frequently hit by floods, which has experienced a significant urban and economic development in the past decades, thus making the dynamic study of FVI particularly relevant. The analysis has been carried out from 1991 to 2016 at a 5-year steps, showing how the integration of different data sources allows to produce a dynamic assessment of vulnerability, which can be very relevant for planning in support of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.

The probability of the concurrence of these extreme events in the upper reaches of the river network is of particular importance for the lower reaches, which is referred to as the encounter probability of extreme events, and may have even stronger socio-economic impacts. In this study, the Rao River basin in China is selected as an example to explore the encounter probability and risk of future flood and drought based on the encounter probability model. The reference period was 1971-2000, and the future prediction periods were 2020-2049 and 2070-2099. The calibrated and validated statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was used to generate future daily precipitation and daily mean temperature. The calibrated and validated Xin'anjiang model was used to predict future daily mean streamflow in the basin. In addition, the encounter probability model was established using the joint distribution of occurrence dates and magnitudes of daily mean streamflow to investigate the encounter probabilities of flood and drought under future climate change. Results show that, for flood occurrence dates, the encounter probability during the flood season would decrease in the two future periods while the dates would generally be earlier. For flood magnitudes, the encounter probability of the two tributaries' floods and the probability of flood at each tributary would decrease (e.g., the encounter probability with the same-frequency of 100-years would reduce by 53% to 95%), which indicates reduced risk of future major floods in the study area. For drought occurrence dates, the encounter probability during the non-flood season would decrease. For drought magnitudes, the encounter probability would decrease (e.g., the encounter probability with the same-frequency of 100-years would reduce by 18% to 33%), even though the probability of future drought at each tributary would increase. Such analyses provide important probabilistic information to help us prepare for the upcoming extreme events.

In cities, the population and major facilities are concentrated, and to examine flooding issues in these urban areas, different levels of flooding risk are classified on 100 m x 100 m geographic grids to maximize the spatial efficiency during the flooding events and to minimize the following flooding damage. In this analysis, vulnerability and exposure tests are adopted to analyze urban flooding risks. The first method is based on land-use planning, and the building-to-land ratio. Using fuzzy approaches, the tests focus on risks. However, the latter method using the HEC-Ras model examines factors such as topology and precipitation volume. By mapping the classification of land-use and flooding, the risk of urban flooding is evaluated by grade-scales: green, yellow, orange, and red zones. There are two key findings and theoretical contributions of this study. First, the areas with a high flood risk are mainly restricted to central commercial areas where the main urban functions are concentrated. Additionally, the development density and urbanization are relatively high in these areas, in addition to the old center of urban areas. In the case of Changwon City, Euichang-gu and Seongsan-gu have increased the flood risk because of the high property value of commercial areas and high building density in these regions. Thus, land-use planning of these districts should be designed to reflect upon the different levels of flood risks, in addition to the preparation of anti-disaster facilities to mitigate flood damages in high flood risk areas. Urban flood risk analysis for individual land use districts would facilitate urban planners and managers to prioritize the areas with a high flood risk and to prepare responding preventive measures for more efficient flood management.

Mull.Arg, Euphorbiaceae). Thus, we investigated the effects of different substrate water availability treatments on anatomical features of the secondary xylem, and the diameter, density, and proportion of laticifers in saplings of rubber trees. Lower substrate water availability resulted in shorter fibers and higher fiber fraction, lower gelatinous fiber fraction, higher vessel density, and lower laticifer density. Under lower water availability, changes in the secondary xylem favor safety in water transport. In the case of laticifers, which are present in the secondary phloem, their structural characteristics may represent a significant decrease in the latex production capacity, which in large forest plantations may reflect economic losses.

Taking the mountainous area of Daqing River basin as the studied area, this paper reveals the variability point and inconsistency characteristics of rainfall-runoff and rainstorm-flood and presents a new approach using a copula function and geostatistical method to show spatial variability of rainfall-runoff and rainstorm-flood with the proposed virtual runoff and virtual flood. The results demonstrate that rainfall-runoff and rainstorm-flood relationships exist during great changes before and after variation point. Especially after the variation point, rainfall-runoff and rainstorm-flood relationships show more inconsistency with moderate and strong spatial variability, which are mostly in the northern area of the basin. Meanwhile, spatial variability in the rainfall-runoff relationship is similar to that in the rainstorm-flood relationship.

However, their deployment strategy is a challenge because it depends on uncertain short-term weather conditions. The strategies that later proved to be insufficient or underused can have high social and environmental costs. Real options analysis (ROA) provides a mechanism to include flexibility in decision making to adapt the deployment strategies to future conditions and handle the aforementioned challenge in temporary flood defenses planning. To apply ROA principles, we combined multistage stochastic programming and a scenario tree. The methodology provided adaptive and flexible deployment decisions as uncertain future weather conditions were resolved. The proposed formulation was applied to nine flood-affected locations in Carlisle, northwest England, and the implications of the results were investigated. The results showed that there is a value achieved by building ROA in design of temporary defense deployment planning under uncertainty. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This paper tests this basic assumption in the context of the National Flood Insurance Program and flood insurance purchasing in San Francisco Bay, California. Using spatially explicit household survey data, we use mediation models to analyze how an individual's knowledge about which flood zone they live is associated with their flood risk perception and likelihood of purchasing flood insurance. The results suggest that the relationship between risk information, perception, and behavior varies across "risk-informed" who are aware of their flood zone designation versus "risk-uninformed" individuals who are unsure of their flood zone designation. The findings highlight the importance accurately mapping and communicating flood risks in the context of variation in topography, urban structure, and future climate change.

Risk assessment for areas prone to flooding and subsidence: a case study from Bergen, Western Norway	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	30th Nordic Hydrological Conference	AUG 13-15, 2018	Bergen, NORWAY	Norwegian Hydrol Council, Nordic Hydrol Assoc		flooding; groundwater; InSAR; risk assessment; subsidence; surface water	LAND SUBSIDENCE; SAR INTERFEROMETRY; URBAN; IMPLEMENTATION; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; HERITAGE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; CITIES	Bergen city centre is prone to both subsidence and flooding. With a predicted increase in precipitation due to climate change, a higher proportion of rainfall becomes surface runoff, which results in increased peak flood discharges. In addition, it has been predicted that sea-level rise and increasing storm surges will result in coastal flooding. In this study, the dual hazards of flooding and subsidence are analysed to exemplify possible risk assessment maps for areas most prone to the combination of both. Risk assessment maps are a support tool to identify areas where mitigation of subsidence and adaptation for surface water management will be most efficient and measures can be implemented. The results show that dual hazard assessment, like that described in this paper, can be a useful tool for decision-makers when prioritizing areas to implement measures such as Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems.

For example, cladoceran communities in peatland systems in the subarctic region have not been fully investigated. We used paleolimnological and paleoecological methods to study plant and cladoceran assemblages and the community dynamics in two subarctic peatlands, which differ in their hydrological characteristics. At the first site, Iitto, river floods introduce planktonic species to fen pools and the steep topography of the catchment induces rapid but relatively short flooding periods. Fluctuating environmental conditions result in a high amount of cladoceran resting stages in the samples. At the other site, Kaamanen, the cladoceran assemblage goes through clear directional changes, which could be attributed to changes in fen hydrology and ultimately to climatic changes during the past two millennia.

Extreme flows are inherently difficult to model, being infrequent, irregularly spaced, and affected by nonstationary climatic controls. To identify patterns in extreme flows, a quantile regression approach can be used. This paper introduces a new framework for spatiotemporal quantile regression modeling, where the regression model is built as an additive model that includes smooth functions of time and space, as well as space-time interaction effects. The model exploits the flexibility that P-splines offer and can be easily extended to incorporate potential covariates. We propose to estimate model parameters using a penalized least squares regression approach as an alternative to linear programming methods, classically used in quantile parameter estimation. The model is illustrated on a data set of flows in 98 rivers across Scotland.

Recent water level changes across Earth's largest lake system and implications for future variability	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Editorial Material								Water levels on Lake Ontario, the most downstream of the Laurentian Great Lakes, reached a record high in the spring of 2017. This event was accompanied by widespread flooding and displacement of families. Water levels across all of the Great Lakes have risen over the past several years following a period of record low levels. When levels were low, public and expert discussion focused on the possibility that low levels would continue into the future due to climate change, diversions of water from the lakes, and dredging. During the current high water period, variability is being attributed to water management, despite evidence of unusually high precipitation and river flows across the region.

In this study, four RCM simulations driven by different GCMs (CSIRO-Mk3.6.0, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-MR) are used as an ensemble to project changes in extreme high and low temperatures in China as represented by selected Expert Team on Climate Change Detection indices. Each simulation is performed at 25 km resolution from 1980 to 2099 using RegCM4.4 RCM. Results show the following: (a) All four reasonably reproduce climatological maximum daily maximum temperature (TX), warm spell duration, minimum daily minimum temperature (TN), and cold spell duration, but the majority shows relatively weak ability to capture climatological warm day and cold night frequencies. (b) Although the RCM homogenizes much of the variance originally shown between driving GCM simulations, marked dissimilarities are still shown in western China across the four downscaling simulations, implying a dependency on the individual GCM-driven RCM simulation for this region. (c) All of China shows an increase in maximum TX, warm days, warm spell duration, minimum TN, and a decrease in cold nights and cold spell duration, during the near-term, middle-term, and long-term. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent regions show more significant changes in extreme temperature, indicating stronger sensitivity to changes in extremes. RCM downscaling projects less significant change in extreme temperatures than the driving GCM. (d) The ensemble of RCM simulations projects that area-averaged maximum TX, warm days, warm spell duration, and minimum TN increase over China as a whole by 2.5 degrees C, 21.1%, 43.6 days, and 3.3 degrees C, respectively, while cold nights and cold spell duration decrease by 6.8% and 2.0 days, respectively during the long-term under the RCP4.5 scenario relative to 1986-2005. Future episodes of extreme high temperature are likely to require more research as they become more common.

We map the location of historic resources in municipal areas in Colorado (n= 863) and find that 16.8 percent of National Register and State Register properties (n= 145) intersect with a mapped floodplain, as well as 74.0 percent of National Register districts. We then study fourteen case study municipalities that are representative of those with substantial shares of their historic resources in floodplains. We find that most municipalities value their historic resources but very few proactively plan for their protection from hazards.

For this purpose, we firstly quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of heavy rainfalls with various durations (1 h to multiple days) and return periods (2-year to 50-year) for the flood prone country Cambodia, as a case study, during the historical period (1980-2005), mid-century (2040-2065), and late-century (2070-2095), using the latest three hourly climate model datasets under RCP 8.5 and 1 hourly ERA5 reanalysis datasets. A novel conditional artificial neural network (CANN) model is employed for temporal disaggregation to obtain the monthly maximum of 1 hourly rainfall in the future periods and subsequently, a zero-inflated generalized extreme value function (ZIGEV) is applied for extreme value analysis (EVA) to obtain rainfall intensity with different return periods. Secondly, the province-level flood risk change maps are developed based on a novel flood risk change index. The combination of CANN and ZIGEV performs better in EVA than traditional approaches by reducing the uncertainty from the stationarity assumption of temporal disaggregation and bias in the disaggregated rainfall. Rainfall intensity is projected to increase more in higher return periods and shorter durations towards the late-century, predominantly over Southern and Central Cambodia. Projected rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves in the capital city, Phnom Penh, reveal that the occurrence frequency of heavy rainfall in a given duration (e.g., 48 h) is likely to become ~10-fold in the mid-century. Results of province-level flood risk change maps indicate that Southeastern and Northwestern regions should be prioritized for employing adaption strategies. Our results will assist the policy makers in further mapping the flood susceptibility and vulnerability in different spatiotemporal scales across various communities and localities in the country and beyond.

This study aims to provide an in-depth elaboration of the contents discussed in open access literature regarding wind disaster adaptation in cities. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to refine topics and main contents based on 232 publications (1900 to 2019) extracted from Web of Science and Scopus. We conducted a full-text analysis to filter out focal cities along with their adaptation measures. The results show that wind disaster adaptation research in cities has formed a systematic framework in four aspects: 1) vulnerability and resilience of cities, 2) damage evaluation, 3) response and recovery, and 4) health impacts of wind disaster. Climate change is the background for many articles discussing vulnerability and adaptation in coastal areas. It is also embedded in damage evaluation since it has the potential to exacerbate disaster consequences. The literature is strongly inclined towards more developed cities such as New York City and New Orleans, among which New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy ranks first (38/232). Studies on New York City cover all the aspects, including the health impacts of wind disasters which are significantly less studied now. Distinct differences do exist in the number of measures regarding the adaptation categories and their subcategories. We also find that hard adaptation measures (i.e., structural and physical measures) are far more popular than soft adaptation measures (i.e., social and institutional measures). Our findings suggest that policymakers should pay more attention to cities that have experienced major wind disasters other than New York. They should embrace the up-to-date climate change study to defend short-term disasters and take precautions against long-term changes. They should also develop hard-soft hybrid adaptation measures, with special attention on the soft side, and enhance the health impact study of wind-related disasters.

Poverty mitigation through optimized water development and use: Insights from the Volta Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Optimal growth; River basin; Volta; Infrastructure; Poverty; Mitigation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESOURCES; IMPACT; ENERGY; FOOD; IRRIGATION; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; BALANCE; AFRICA	Ongoing challenges from population growth and climate stress on the water resources of the Volta River Basin raise the importance of finding economically sustainable water development and use patterns. Much research has been conducted on the impacts of water supply fluctuations, climate change, and population growth on effective economic access to water resources of the basin. However, no work to date has comprehensively investigated the sustainable economic performance of additional infrastructure development in the basin for handling ongoing challenges of climate water stress at the entire basin scale. The original contribution of this work is to investigate the capacity to mitigate poverty from new reservoir storage capacity if established in a flood-prone region in northern Ghana, using a basin-scale hydro-economic optimization framework, while accounting for five major water uses for six riparian countries. An integrated approach is formulated to link the hydrologic, agronomic, institutional, and economic dimensions of the basin into a unified framework for policy analysis. A dynamic optimization model is developed and applied to discover the level and distribution of economic impacts from the additional storage infrastructure development. Results indicate the potential to increase economic benefits to Ghana and Burkina Faso, with no economic loss to any other riparian, from the development and operation of additional storage infrastructure. Results show considerable potential to secure an Actual Pareto Improvement, by which Ghana and Burkina Faso are better off with the new storage infrastructure than without it, and no other riparian country in the basin is worse off. Additional storage infrastructure in the flood-prone area of the basin in northern Ghana carries the potential to store water during wet seasons and years and release water for use in dry seasons and years, reallocating water among seasons and years, elevating economic development to the Basin's riparian countries. Despite our optimistic findings, considerable stakeholder negotiations and cooperation will be needed to secure the potential welfare gains uncovered.

J	Van Coppenolle, R; Temmerman, S				Van Coppenolle, Rebecca; Temmerman, Stijn			A global exploration of tidal wetland creation for nature-based flood risk mitigation in coastal cities	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Tidal wetlands; Restoration/creation; Cities; Storm surge; Nature-based strategies	MANGROVE FORESTS; STORM-SURGE; MANAGED REALIGNMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESTORATION; MARSH; LAND; IMPACTS; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS	Coastal cities around the world are increasingly exposed to flood risks due to climate change, resulting sea level rise and more intense storm surges as well as due to growing coastal population densities and land subsidence. Nature-based risk mitigation, consisting of conservation or creation of coastal ecosystems that have the natural capacity to adapt to sea level rise and to mitigate storm surges, is increasingly proposed, but real-live implementation is yet limited to specific local cases. Our study presents a global scale analysis of the surface areas available for potential creation or restoration of tidal wetlands (salt marshes and mangrove forests) in front of 135 highly populated, flood-exposed coastal cities, as part of nature-based or hybrid strategies to buffer against coastal flood risks. Our results reveal that 34% (4 600 km(2)) of the total land area within the influence zone of storm surge propagation between the sea and the cities is potentially available for tidal wetlands creation. Those areas mainly correspond to rural areas with a low population density such as croplands, paddy fields or vegetated areas and to water bodies. The key factors influencing the area potentially available for tidal wetlands creation are the geomorphology and the population density, as 60% (8 300 km(2)) of the land area below mean high tide in front of the studied cities is urbanized or densely populated. Cities located along deltas or estuaries and in bays and lagoons (e.g. Hamburg, Guayaquil, Tianjin, Portland or San Jose) have generally larger low-lying coastal zones and consequently larger potentially available areas for salt marshes and mangrove forests restoration or creation for coastal flood risks mitigation. Our results contribute to increasing evidence and awareness of the possibilities of nature-based mitigation of coastal flood risks by restoring and creating tidal wetlands in front of flood-exposed coastal cities around the world.

Climate and ecology in the Rocky Mountain interior after the early Eocene Climatic Optimum	CLIMATE OF THE PAST			English	Article							GREEN RIVER FORMATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS; ATLANTIC IGNEOUS PROVINCE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; THERMAL MAXIMUM; PALEOATMOSPHERIC PCO(2); PALEOBOTANICAL EVIDENCE; PEDOGENIC CARBONATE	As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperatures increase with modern climate change, ancient hothouse periods become a focal point for understanding ecosystem function under similar conditions. The early Eocene exhibited high temperatures, high CO2 levels, and similar tectonic plate configuration as today, so it has been invoked as an analog to modern climate change. During the early Eocene, the greater Green River Basin (GGRB) of southwestern Wyoming was covered by an ancient hypersaline lake (Lake Gosiute; Green River Formation) and associated fluvial and floodplain systems (Wasatch and Bridger formations). The volcaniclastic Bridger Formation was deposited by an inland delta that drained from the northwest into freshwater Lake Gosiute and is known for its vast paleontological assemblages. Using this well-preserved basin deposited during a period of tectonic and paleoclimatic interest, we employ multiple proxies to study trends in provenance, parent material, weathering, and climate throughout 1 million years. The Blue Rim escarpment exposes approximately 100 m of the lower Bridger Formation, which includes plant and mammal fossils, solitary paleosol profiles, and organic remains suitable for geochemical analyses, as well as ash beds and volcaniclastic sandstone beds suitable for radioisotopic dating. New 40Ar / 39Ar ages from the middle and top of the Blue Rim escarpment constrain the age of its strata to similar to 49.5-48.5 Myr ago during the "falling limb" of the early Eocene Climatic Optimum. We used several geochemical tools to study provenance and parent material in both the paleosols and the associated sediments and found no change in sediment input source despite significant variation in sedimentary facies and organic carbon burial. We also reconstructed environmental conditions, including temperature, precipitation (both from paleosols), and the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 from plants found in the floral assemblages. Results from paleosol-based reconstructions were compared to semi-co-temporal reconstructions made using leaf physiognomic techniques and marine proxies. The paleosol-based reconstructions (near the base of the section) of precipitation (608-1167 mm yr(-1)) and temperature (10.4 to 12.0 degrees C) were within error of, although lower than, those based on floral assemblages, which were stratigraphically higher in the section and represented a highly preserved event later in time. Geochemistry and detrital feldspar geochronology indicate a consistent provenance for Blue Rim sediments, sourcing predominantly from the Idaho paleoriver, which drained the active Challis volcanic field. Thus, because there was neither significant climatic change nor significant provenance change, variation in sedimentary facies and organic carbon burial likely reflected localized geomorphic controls and the relative height of the water table. The ecosystem can be characterized as a wet, subtropical-like forest (i.e., paratropical) throughout the interval based upon the floral humidity province and Holdridge life zone schemes. Given the mid-paleolatitude position of the Blue Rim escarpment, those results are consistent with marine proxies that indicate that globally warm climatic conditions continued beyond the peak warm conditions of the early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The reconstructed atmospheric delta C-13 value (-5.3 parts per thousand to -5.8 parts per thousand) closely matches the independently reconstructed value from marine microfossils (-5. As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperatures increase with modern climate change, ancient hothouse periods become a focal point for understanding ecosystem function under similar conditions.

The paleosol-based reconstructions (near the base of the section) of precipitation (608-1167 mm yr(-1)) and temperature (10.4 to 12.0 degrees C) were within error of, although lower than, those based on floral assemblages, which were stratigraphically higher in the section and represented a highly preserved event later in time. Geochemistry and detrital feldspar geochronology indicate a consistent provenance for Blue Rim sediments, sourcing predominantly from the Idaho paleoriver, which drained the active Challis volcanic field. Thus, because there was neither significant climatic change nor significant provenance change, variation in sedimentary facies and organic carbon burial likely reflected localized geomorphic controls and the relative height of the water table. The ecosystem can be characterized as a wet, subtropical-like forest (i.e., paratropical) throughout the interval based upon the floral humidity province and Holdridge life zone schemes. Given the mid-paleolatitude position of the Blue Rim escarpment, those results are consistent with marine proxies that indicate that globally warm climatic conditions continued beyond the peak warm conditions of the early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The reconstructed atmospheric delta C-13 value (-5.3 parts per thousand to -5.8 parts per thousand) closely matches the independently reconstructed value from marine microfossils (-5.

A large number of studies have focused on their impact on dry-season stream discharge due to enhanced transpiration. The impact of invasive trees on stream discharge and flood risk during extreme rain events, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change, has not been addressed adequately. We examined the in-fluence of land-cover, canopy cover, and other catchment morphological characteristics on stream discharges in hilly catchments during light, heavy, and extreme rain events. Three years of rainfall-runoff observations, be-tween January 2014 and December 2016, were collected in eleven neighbouring mountainous catchments in Nilgiris, South India. Each catchment had a distinct land cover, namely shola forests, montane grasslands, and catchments invaded by wattle (Acacia mearnsii). Hourly rain intensities between the percentiles 25-90, 90-95 and over 95 were categorised as light, heavy and extreme respectively, and were used to study hourly peak stream discharge responses. We compared discharge between native grassland catchments and grassland catchments invaded by wattle. Discharge rates were corrected for the catchment area. We found that land cover and canopy-cover influenced the hydrologic response to extreme rain events. Regression models with flood event as the response variable suggested an increase in rainfall-runoff response with an increase in canopy cover. The maximum hourly discharge observed in the reference grassland catchment (0.00098 mm s-1) was lower than the maximum discharge observed in low density (0.00529 mm s-1) and high density (0.00497 mm s-1) wattle catchments. At higher discharges, the flood magnitude in wattle invaded catchments was much greater than that in the grassland catchment for a given flood frequency - indicating a higher risk of severe flooding in wattle-dominated catchments. We attribute the enhanced flood discharges to the effects of spreading wattle roots on the enhancement of rapid, shallow sub-surface flows in invaded catchments. Catchments dominated by shallow sub-surface flows are known to have reduced water retention times in response to high rain intensities. Ante-cedent moisture conditions and drainage density were other factors that influenced the local rainfall-runoff relationships. In the Western Ghats and other parts of India grasslands have been planted with exotic woody trees, and some have become invasive. Our study indicates that replacing grasslands with woody plants at landscape scales, could affect hydrological processes and could increase flood risks during the monsoon, espe-cially in mountainous regions. Management of invaded catchments by regulation of wattle and restoration of semi-natural grassland, combined with the installation of early warning systems in these impacted areas will help reduce flood risk during extreme rain under climate change.

To assess these hydroclimatic risks under high-end emission scenario RCP8.5, this study used the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting (CP) 4 km resolution to dynamically downscale the mean projection of a 19-member CMIP5 ensemble by the end of the 21st century. The CP simulations include a retrospective simulation (CTL, 2000-2015) for verification forced by ERA-Interim and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) for climate change projection forced with climate change forcing (2071-2100 to 1976-2005) from CMIP5 ensemble added on ERA-Interim. The retrospective WRF-CTL's surface air temperature simulation was evaluated against Canadian daily analysis ANUS-PLIN, showing good agreements in the geographical distribution with cold biases east of the Canadian Rockies, especially in spring. WRF-CTL captures the main pattern of observed precipitation distribution from CaPA and ANUS-PLIN but shows a wet bias near the British Columbia coast in winter and over the immediate region on the lee side of the Canadian Rockies. The WRF-PGW simulation shows significant warming relative to CTL, especially over the polar region in the northeast during the cold season, and in daily minimum temperature. Precipitation changes in PGW over CTL vary with the seasons: in spring and late autumn precipitation increases in most areas, whereas in summer in the Saskatchewan River basin and southern Canadian Prairies, the precipitation change is negligible or decreased slightly. With almost no increase in precipitation and much more evapotranspiration in the future, the water availability during the growing season will be challenging for the Canadian Prairies. The WRF-PGW projected warming is less than that by the CMIP5 ensemble in all seasons. The CMIP5 ensemble projects a 10 %-20% decrease in summer precipitation over the Canadian Prairies and generally agrees with WRF-PGW except for regions with significant terrain. This difference may be due to the much higher resolution of WRF being able to more faithfully represent small-scale summer convection and orographic lifting due to steep terrain. WRF-PGW shows an increase in high-intensity precipitation events and shifts the distribution of precipitation events toward more extremely intensive events in all seasons. Due to this shift in precipitation intensity to the higher end in the PGW simulation, the seemingly moderate increase in the total amount of precipitation in summer east of the Canadian Rockies may underestimate the increase in flooding risk and water shortage for agriculture. The change in the probability distribution of precipitation intensity also calls for innovative bias-correction methods to be developed for the application of the dataset when bias correction is required. High-quality meteorological observation over the region is needed for both forcing high-resolution climate simulation and conducting verification. The high-resolution downscaled climate simulations provide abundant opportunities both for investigating local-scale atmospheric dynamics and for studying climate impacts on hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystems.

China is particularly vulnerable to compound events due to the fast warming rate, dense populations, and fragile ecological environment. Recent studies have demonstrated tangible effects of climate change on compound events with mounting impacts on the economy, agriculture, public health, and infrastructure in China, posing unprecedented threats that are increasingly difficult to manage. Here, I synthesize recent progress in studies of compound events and associated impacts in China. Several lines of evidence indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of multiple types of compound events across China. Future directions in studying compound events in China are suggested, including investigating extremes from a compound perspective, modeling compound events in the Anthropocene, quantitative evaluations of risks, and holistic adaptation measures of compound events.

The use of Information and Communication Technologies appears to be an effective way of disaster management worldwide. Shreds of evidence of this statement still lack in Africa, which is considered as the most vulnerable continent. This study empirically analyzes the impact of Information and Communication Technologies on natural disaster management in Africa. The econometric approach is based on the estimation of a panel data model using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Generalized Method-of-Moment (GMM) and Fixed-Effect Poisson estimators (FE). The results strongly suggest that cell phone and internet penetration reduce the negative consequences of natural disasters. Thus, it recommends to the governments of these countries to strengthen the creation and diffusion of ICT capacity.

An interdisciplinary synthesis of floodplain ecosystem dynamics in a rapidly deglaciating watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Glaciers; Climate change; Pacific salmon; River corridor; British Columbia	BRITISH-COLUMBIA; PROGLACIAL LAKES; GLACIER RETREAT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT; SALMON; FUTURE; TEMPERATURE; SUCCESSION; EVOLUTION	Glacier retreat is rapidly transforming some watersheds, with ramifications for water supply, ecological succession, important species such as Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and cultural uses of landscapes. To advance a more holistic understanding of the evolution of proglacial landscapes, we integrate multiple lines of knowledge starting in the early 1900s with contemporary data from the Taaltsuxei (Tulsequah) Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. Our objectives were to: 1) synthesize recent historical geography and Indigenous Knowledge, including glacier dynamics, and hydrology; 2) describe the limnology of a proglacial lake; 3) quantify decadal-scale downstream physical floodplain change; and 4) characterize riverine physical, chemical, and biological differences relative to distance from the proglacial lake. Since 1982, the Tulsequah Glacier has receded 0.07 km/yr, exposing a cold, deep, and growing proglacial lake. The downstream floodplain is rapidly changing; satellite imagery analysis revealed a 14 % increase in vegetation from 2003 to 2017 and Indigenous Knowledge described increases in vegetation and wildlife habitat over the last century. Contemporary measurements of physical-chemical water properties differed across sites representing the upper and lower watershed, and mainstem and off-channel habitats. Catches of juvenile salmonids in the upper watershed (closer to the glacier) were mostly limited to warmer, clearer groundwater-fed channels, whereas in the lower watershed there were salmonids in both groundwater-fed and mainstem habitats. There was limited zooplankton taxa diversity from the proglacial lake and benthic macroinvertebrates in the river. Collectively, our synthesis suggests that the transformation of proglacial landscapes experiencing rapid ice loss can be influenced by interlinked abiotic processes of glacier retreat, lake formation, and altered hydrology, as well as corresponding biological processes such as beaver repopulation, wetland formation, and riparian vegetation growth. These factors, along with expected increases to proglacial lake productivity and salmon habitat suitability, are an important consideration for forward-looking watershed management of glacier-fed rivers.

Agriculture is also recognized as the source and sink of GHGs. The share of agriculture to the global GHG emission records has been widely investigated, but the impact on our food production systems has been overlooked for decades until the recent climate crisis. Livestock production and feed, nitrogen-rich fertilizers and livestock manure application, crop residue burning, as well as water management in flood-prone cultivation areas are components of agriculture that produce and emit most GHGs. Although agriculture produces 72-89% less GHGs than other sectors, it is believed that reducing GHG emissions in agriculture would considerably lower its share of the global GHG emission records, which may lead to enormous benefits for the environment and food production systems. However, several diverging and controversial views questioning the actual role of plants in the current global GHG budget continue to nourish the debate globally. We must acknowledge that considering the beneficial roles of major GHGs to plants at a certain level of accumulation, implementing GHG mitigation measures from agriculture is indeed a complex task. This work provides a comprehensive review of agriculture-related GHG production and emission mechanisms, as well as GHG mitigation measures regarded as potential solutions available in the literature. This review also discusses in depth the significance and the dynamics of mitigation measures regarded as game changers with a high potential to enhance, in a sustainable manner, the resilience of agricultural systems. Some of the old but essential agricultural practices and livestock feed techniques are revived and discussed. Agricultural GHG mitigation approaches discussed in this work can serve as game changers in the attempt to reduce GHG emissions and alleviate the impact of climate change through sustainable agriculture and informed decision-making.

For this purpose, eight indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices have been computed based on an ensemble-mean of simulations from the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling in CLimate Mode (CCLM) regional climate model, under the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario RCP8.5. The ability of CCLM to represent the climatology of considered daily hydroclimatic extreme indices related to both precipitation and temperature was also assessed. The results showed that despite the presence of some biases, the precipitation and temperature indices are satisfactorily represented by CCLM, with some notable improvements compared to the GCMs driving fields. The climate change signals under 1.5 degrees C GWL threshold show mostly increases (decreases) in SDII, CDD, R95PTOT, T10, T90, WSDI, and DTR (RR1) over CA throughout the year, and these effects intensify towards a warmer world. Singularly, the strongest changes in these extreme events are generally recorded during the JJA season over the northern part of CA. The results also show on one hand a widespread decrease in mean precipitation (up to 2 mm center dot day(-1) corresponding to similar to 50%) associated with the increase/decrease in CDD/RR1, and on the other hand an increase in mean temperatures (up to 4 degrees C corresponding to similar to 18%) associated with the increase in both lowest and highest temperatures (T10, T90). This study suggests that the CA region will be prone to droughts and floods as well as heat waves in a warmer world and calls for climate action and adaptation strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the above changes on rain-fed agriculture, water resource, and human health.

J	Jin, HY; Chen, XH; Zhong, RD; Liu, MY; Ye, CX				Jin, Haoyu; Chen, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ruida; Liu, Moyang; Ye, Changxin			Construction of precipitation index based on ensemble forecast and heavy precipitation forecast in the Hanjiang River Basin, China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Extreme precipitation; Precipitation forecasting; TIGGE; BMA; The Hanjiang River Basin	NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION; MODEL	Uncertainty about the occurrence of extreme precipitation events has increased significantly under global climate change. The Hanjiang River Basin (HRB) is located at the junction of the north and the south of China, and extreme precipitation events occur frequently due to the impact of climate change. Extreme precipitation is the leading factor causing flood disasters in the HRB, and effective forecasting of extreme precipitation is of great significance for preventing flood disasters. In this study, we take full advantage of the uncertainty information in THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) ensemble forecasts datasets and perform statistical postprocessing through the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. Then, the extreme precipitation index (EPI) is constructed using the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of historical model precipitation and the forecast precipitation. The research results show that the constructed EPI index can well reflect the occurrence intensity of precipitation in the HRB. According to the Spearman correlation coefficient, the CMA model has the best effect, followed by the control forecast (CF) model, and the JMA model has the worst effect. As indicated by the area under curve (AUC) indicator at the 25 mm precipitation threshold, the forecast effect of CMA model is still the best, followed by the CF model, and the third is the control forecast and perturbed forecast (CFPF) model. The comprehensive effect of the JMA model is significantly worse than other models. Under the precipitation threshold of 50 mm, the prediction effect of the NCEP model is the best, followed by the ECMWF model, and the third is the CF model. The least effective is also the JMA model, followed by the UKMO model. Under the precipitation threshold of 25 mm, the prediction effect of all models is better than that of the precipitation threshold of 50 mm. The prediction stability of NCEP and ECMWF models is the strongest, and the effects of CF and CFPF models integrating multiple models are in the middle. This study provides an important reference for the theory and application of extreme precipitation forecasting in the HRB.

Design/methodology/approachA qualitative study protocol was used, based on pertinent literature that considers how business entities withstand, adapt and/or recover from non-linear climate change impacts, natural hazards and extreme weather. Data was obtained by conducting semi-structured interviews with 82 MSMEs' owners-managers who had recently experienced flooding. FindingsThe study reports limited activities of MSMEs towards flood resilience capacity despite the threat of relevant disasters. Findings suggest that most owners-managers of these enterprises are not adequately preparing their businesses for the impacts of flooding. Research limitations/implicationsThe findings call for multi-level and dynamic perspectives to be examined in assessing MSME resilience capacity to floods. It is attitudinal, managerial, organisational, behavioural and regulatory (as well as other institutional) factors that merit further investigation. Such an investigation would allow a better understanding as to whether these factors hinder or enable conditions for microeconomic flood preparedness and resilience as well as how they may interact with each other or create feedback loops. Practical implicationsThe study carries managerial implications and policy recommendations in terms of nurturing opportunities towards awareness-raising campaigns for reducing deficits in managerial knowledge and competencies. It also encapsulates practical implications in terms of emphasising supporting mechanisms from key institutional stakeholders to allow MSMEs scan available options they have in effectively reinforcing the business premises from the forces of rising waters. Originality/valueMost of the related studies have examined flood impacts, responses and/or resilience capacity at the household- or community-level. Empirical work that is conducted to ascertain how MSMEs cope with flooding remains thin on the ground. In response to this, the current study and the typology of MSMEs' strategic postures that are suggested seek to contribute to this under-researched topic.

These ecosystems are however highly sensitive to Climate Change and changes in the management practices. It is of utmost importance to address relevant ecosystem scales in order to fully understand carbon dynamics in coastal wetlands. In this regard, Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide spatial scales detailed enough to address the fine scale patters of topsoil organic carbon accumulation in coastal wetlands. This study demonstrates the use of multispectral and photogrammetric data derived from UAVs to accurately map plant communities and topsoil organic carbon concentration in coastal wetlands. The overall accuracies from the classification of plant communities ranged from 88% to 97% whereas RMSE for topsoil organic carbon concentration ranged from 2.44% to 0.74%. By combining both models, site-specific variations in topsoil carbon concentrations among plant communities were unveiled. Open pioneer communities consistently showed the lowest topsoil organic carbon concentration, while the concentrations vary considerably across plant communities characterized by denser vegetation coverage. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 radar data was used to assess the spatial patterns of flood frequency. GAMs were used to combine flood frequency with the plant communities and topsoil organic carbon models, as well as an aboveground biomass (AGB) model from a previous study. GAMs revealed a stronger effect than flood frequency on topsoil organic carbon. Regarding flooding, increased flood frequency generally led decreased topsoil organic concentrations across communities and sites. However, the relative contribution of flood frequency to topsoil organic carbon concentration in Baltic coastal wetlands depends strongly on the location of the wetland and the nature of the floods. Higher flood frequencies could lead to increased topsoil organic carbon in wetlands subject to the input of estuarine sediments. Lastly, the integration of remote sensing platforms constitutes an effective tool for revealing spatial heterogeneity of carbon storage in coastal wetlands.

Impact of Extreme Weather on Healthcare Utilization by People with HIV in Metropolitan Miami	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						extreme weather events; climate and health; climate change; healthcare access; HIV		Extreme weather events (EWE) are expected to increase as climate change intensifies, leaving coastal regions exposed to higher risks. South Florida has the highest HIV infection rate in the United States, and disruptions in clinic utilization due to extreme weather conditions could affect adherence to treatment and increase community transmission. The objective of this study was to identify the association between EWE and HIV-clinic attendance rates at a large academic medical system serving the Miami-Dade communities. The following methods were utilized: (1) Extreme heat index (EHI) and extreme precipitation (EP) were identified using daily observations from 1990-2019 that were collected at the Miami International Airport weather station located 3.6 miles from the studied HIV clinics. Data on hurricanes, coastal storms and flooding were collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Storms Database (NOAA) for Miami-Dade County. (2) An all-HIV clinic registry identified scheduled daily visits during the study period (hurricane seasons from 2017-2019). (3) Daily weather data were linked to the all-HIV clinic registry, where patients' 'no-show' status was the variable of interest. (4) A time-stratified, case crossover model was used to estimate the relative risk of no-show on days with a high heat index, precipitation, and/or an extreme natural event. A total of 26,444 scheduled visits were analyzed during the 383-day study period. A steady increase in the relative risk of 'no-show' was observed in successive categories, with a 14% increase observed on days when the heat index was extreme compared to days with a relatively low EHI, 13% on days with EP compared to days with no EP, and 10% higher on days with a reported extreme weather event compared to days without such incident. This study represents a novel approach to improving local understanding of the impacts of EWE on the HIV-population's utilization of healthcare, particularly when the frequency and intensity of EWE is expected to increase and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. More studies are needed to understand the impact of EWE on routine outpatient settings.

However, education's co-influencing effect along with family and society was unclear. This study investigated a three-year disaster education program conducted in schools in Sichuan Province, China. Method: In three pilot counties, we used stratified duster sampling in 2016 and 2018 to separately survey the risk perceptions of 2,105 children (baseline) and 1710 children (post-intervention), respectively, aged 8-12, in 45 primary schools. The Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Propensity Score Matching Method (PSM) were used to assess the effectiveness of classroom education, propaganda poster, professional guidance, social education (television, radio, friends, and internet), and risk-related parent-child interactions. Interaction items and Structure Equation Model (SEM) were performed to identify their co-influencing mechanisms. Finally, the intervention effect was assessed by categorizing different levels of parent-child interactions and left-behind status. Result: The classroom education (Coeff = 0.040; P < 0.05), propaganda poster (Coeff = 0.024; P < 0.05), and professional guidance (Coeff = 0.016; P < 0.1) had significantly positive effects on children's flood risk perception. But these effects were found to be underestimated using PSM. Interaction effects between disaster education and parent-child interaction were statistically significant, and parent-child interaction was a moderating factor for improving risk perception (standardized indirect effect = 0.055, p < 0.001). Additionally, the mean score of risk perception increased by 118% in 2018 compared with the baseline. It was found that the higher the level of risk-related parent-child interaction, the higher the mean scores of risk perception (Coeff = 0.055; P < 0.001) irrespective whether they are left-behind children. Conclusion: To improve disaster resilience and climate change adaptation, risk-related parent-child interaction should be considered in disaster education, which is an effective way to promote children's risk perceptions.

It deals with observed records, noting that flood damage has been increasing. It also tackles projections for the future, related to flood hazard and flood losses. There are multiple factors driving flood hazard and flood risk and there is a considerable uncertainty in our assessments, and particularly in projections for the future. Further, this paper analyses options for flood risk reduction in several spatial dimensions, from global framework to regional to local scales. It is necessary to continue examination of the updated records of flood-related indices, trying to search for changes that influence flood hazard and flood risk in river basins.

Mega-Tidal and Surface Flooding Controls on Coastal Groundwater and Saltwater Intrusion Within Agricultural Dikelands	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						numerical modeling; seawater intrusion; dykes; hydrogeophysics; tidal signals	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SEAWATER INTRUSION; STORM-SURGE; AQUIFERS; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; BAY; TIDES; WAVE	Climate change will increase sea levels, driving saltwater into coastal aquifers and impacting coastal communities and land use viability. Coastal aquifers are also impacted by tides that control groundwater-ocean interactions and maintain an "upper saline plume" (USP) of brackish groundwater. Coastal dikes are designed to limit the surface impacts of high-amplitude tides, but, due to ongoing sea-level rise (SLR), low-lying dikelands and underlying aquifers are becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding from high tides and storm surges. This study combines field observations with numerical modeling to investigate ocean-aquifer mixing and future saltwater intrusion dynamics in a mega-tidal (tidal range >8 m) dikeland along the Bay of Fundy in Atlantic Canada. Field data revealed strong connectivity between the ocean and coastal aquifer, as evidenced by pronounced tidal oscillations in deeper groundwater heads and an order of magnitude intra-tidal change in subsurface electrical resistivity. Numerical model results indicate that SLR and surges will force the migration of the USP landward, amplifying salinization of freshwater resources. Simulated storm surges can overtop the dike, contaminating agricultural soils. The presence of dikes decreased salinization under low surge scenarios, but increased salinization under larger overtopping scenarios due to landward ponding of seawater behind the dike. Mega-tidal conditions maintain a large USP and impact aquifer freshening rates. Results highlight the vulnerability of terrestrial soil landscapes and freshwater resources to climate change and suggest that the subsurface impacts of dike management decisions should be considered in addition to protection measures associated with surface saltwater intrusion processes.

The study area located in SW Spitsbergen, has experienced a warming of 4.5 degrees C in the last 40 years along with a large increase in autumn rainfall. The changes in flow regime were determined based on available hydro-meteorological data and simulations of a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model, which allowed recon-struction of streamflow in the period 1979-2020 and trend analyses for each calendar day. Similar trends of change were detected in all studied catchments. These include earlier onset of snowmelt driven floods (by two weeks over the period of analysis), large increases in autumn flows, prolongation of the hydrologically active season (starts earlier and lasts longer), decrease in flows in the latter half of June and the early part of August (except for the Breelva catch-ment). As a result of increases in autumn precipitation, the flood regime in these catchments has changed from snowmelt-dominated to the bi-modal with peaks in both July/August and September. The results also indicate differ-ences in the magnitude of hydrological response depending on the percentage of glacial coverage in the catchments. The larger the glacierized area is, the larger the changes in the flow regime. The hydrological regime of SW Spitsbergen catchments has undergone dramatic changes over the last four decades. Such a shift in hydro-climatic conditions is larger than that observed in lower latitudes and has significant environmen-tal implications.

The failure of moraine-dammed lakes is associated with hazard for mountain communities due to high velocity and depth with destructive ability of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Therefore, assessment of glacial lake development and downstream flood impacts of critical glacial lakes with their undesirable outcomes is important. This study presents the insight of glacial lake outburst dynamics using detailed inventory of lakes with hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling over the area to be affected. As a result, total 203 glacial lakes are found having surface area > 0.01 km(2) and more than 90% glacial lakes are situated at the high elevation (> 4500 m) zone. In addition, increasing lake size could increase the frequency of outburst and cause socio-economic damages. During the outburst of GL-3 Lake, the flow discharge could be increased by 4-6 times with 100% increase in velocity and depth and the travel time is 1.5-2.5 h to reach the Chugthang habitat. This increasing water level will directly affect the hydropower project at Chugthang, as there is no flat terrain for water spread. The flooding contributed due to lack of awareness of GLOF hazard and non-existence of land-use planning. Therefore, this study anticipated supporting the decision-makers to prepare the management plan in response to futuristic climate scenario and risk measures with inclusive of GLOFs; also suggested to utilize the glacial lakes as reservoir to reduce the risk for mountain communities.

BOTRYTIS; SALT-STRESS; DROUGHT STRESS; HEAT-STRESS	Impacts of climate change like global warming, drought, flooding, and other extreme events are posing severe challenges to global crop production. Contribution of Brassica napus towards the oilseed industry makes it an essential component of international trade and agroeconomics. Consequences from increasing occurrences of multiple abiotic stresses on this crop are leading to agroeconomic losses making it vital to endow B. napus crop with an ability to survive and maintain yield when faced with simultaneous exposure to multiple abiotic stresses. For an improved understanding of the stress sensing machinery, there is a need for analyzing regulatory pathways of multiple stress-responsive genes and other regulatory elements such as non-coding RNAs. However, our understanding of these pathways and their interactions in B. napus is far from complete. This review outlines the current knowledge of stress-responsive genes and their role in imparting multiple stress tolerance in B. napus. Analysis of network cross-talk through omics data mining is now making it possible to unravel the underlying complexity required for stress sensing and signaling in plants. Novel biotechnological approaches such as transgene-free genome editing and utilization of nanoparticles as gene delivery tools are also discussed. These can contribute to providing solutions for developing climate change resilient B. napus varieties with reduced regulatory limitations. The potential ability of synthetic biology to engineer and modify networks through fine-tuning of stress regulatory elements for plant responses to stress adaption is also highlighted.

Such development places an increasing number of people and capital at risk, which calls for public flood management as well as household level adaptation measures that reduce social vulnerability to flooding and climate change. This study explores several private adaptation responses to flood risk, that are driven by various behavioral triggers. We conduct a survey among households in hazard-prone areas in eight coastal states in the USA, of which, some have recently experienced major flooding. While numerous empirical studies have investigated household-level flood damage mitigation, little attention has been given to examining the decision to retreat from flood zones. We examine what behavioral motives drive the choices for flood damage mitigation and relocation separately among property buyers and sellers. Hence, we focus on the drivers that shape demand for future development in flood-prone cities. We find that households' choices to retreat from or to avoid flood zones (1) are highly sensitive to information that provokes people's feelings of fear, and (2) rely on hazardous events to trigger a protective action, which ideally would take place well before these events occur. We highlight that major flooding may cause a potential risk of large-scale outmigration and demographic changes in flood- prone areas, putting more low-income households at risk. Therefore, coordinated policies that integrate bottom- up drivers of individual climate adaptation are needed to increase urban resilience to floods.

Towards multi-objective optimization of large-scale fluvial landscaping measures	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER RESTORATION; BIO-SAFE; MANAGEMENT; RISK; BIODIVERSITY; BASIN; SEDIMENTATION; PERSPECTIVES; NETHERLANDS	Adapting densely populated deltas to the combined impacts of climate change and socioeconomic developments presents a major challenge for their sustainable development in the 21st century. Decisions for the adaptations require an overview of cost and benefits and the number of stakeholders involved, which can be used in stakeholder discussions. Therefore, we quantified the trade-offs of common measures to compensate for an increase in discharge and sea level rise on the basis of relevant, but inexhaustive, quantitative variables. We modeled the largest delta distributary of the Rhine River with adaptation scenarios driven by (1) the choice of seven measures, (2) the areas owned by the two largest stakeholders (LS) versus all stakeholders (AS) based on a priori stakeholder preferences, and (3) the ecological or hydraulic design principle. We evaluated measures by their efficiency in flood hazard reduction, potential bio-diversity, number of stakeholders as a proxy for governance complexity, and measure implementation cost. We found that only floodplain lowering over the whole study area can offset the altered hydrodynamic boundary conditions; for all other measures, additional dike raising is required. LS areas comprise low hanging fruits for water level lowering due to the governance simplicity and hydraulic efficiency. Natural management of meadows (AS), after roughness smoothing and floodplain lowering, represents the optimum combination between potential biodiversity and flood hazard lowering, as it combines a high potential biodiversity with a relatively low hydrodynamic roughness. With this concept, we step up to a multidisciplinary, quantitative multi-parametric, and multi-objective optimization and support the negotiations among stakeholders in the decision-making process.

J	Parsons, M; Nalau, J; Fisher, K; Brown, C				Parsons, Meg; Nalau, Johanna; Fisher, Karen; Brown, Cilia			Disrupting path dependency: Making room for Indigenous knowledge in river management	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Path dependency; Climate change adaptation; Indigenous peoples; New Zealand; River management; Flood risk	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; ADAPTATION; VALUES; VULNERABILITY; POLICY; WATER; GEOGRAPHIES; PERSPECTIVE; RETHINKING	Scholars frequently identify how path dependency serves to constrain the process of climate adaptation and is a key feature of maladaptation. Most studies, however, centre on theoretical, rather than empirical-based discussions of what path dependency is, how it occurs, and what factors assist in breaking path dependency. This paper provides a case study for the creation, maintenance, and attempts to break path dependency within the management of rivers in the Rangitaiki Plains of Aotearoa New Zealand from the 1890s until 2017. We deploy a historical institutionalist theorising on path dependency and institutional arrangements, while also incorporating ideas from indigenous and postcolonial scholarship, which extends current understandings of the factors that contribute towards path dependency at a local level. Through archival research, we demonstrate how successive generations of government policies and actions directed with a specific goal and underpinned by the hegemonic social values created a profoundly path dependent system of managing rivers and flood events. Increased flood vulnerability is one of the direct consequences of the plethora of freshwater engineering interventions which were (and are still) undertaken on the Rangitaiki Plains over the last century. The foundation of this path dependency, we argue, resides with the processes of indigenous dispossession and the marginalisation of Maori values from environmental governance and policy. Efforts to break path dependency, therefore, involve the formal recognition of Maori governance, values, and knowledge within policies, and the translation of Maori values into tangible actions that seek to destabilise Western command-and control approaches to flood risk management.

Landsat sub-pixel land cover dynamics in the Brazilian Amazon	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						land cover; land cover change; Amazon; Landsat; earth engine	CLASSIFICATION; DEFORESTATION; VEGETATION; ACCURACY; CLIMATE	The Brazilian Amazon land cover changes rapidly due to anthropogenic and climate drivers. Deforestation and forest disturbances associated with logging and fires, combined with extreme droughts, warmer air, and surface temperatures, have led to high tree mortality and harmful net carbon emissions in this region. Regional attempts to characterize land cover dynamics in this region focused on one or two anthropogenic drivers (i.e., deforestation and forest degradation). Land cover studies have also used a limited temporal scale (i.e., 10-15 years), focusing mainly on global and country-scale forest change. In this study, we propose a novel approach to characterize and measure land cover dynamics in the Amazon biome. First, we defined 10 fundamental land cover classes: forest, flooded forest, shrubland, natural grassland, pastureland, cropland, outcrop, bare and impervious, wetland, and water. Second, we mapped the land cover based on the compositional abundance of Landsat sub-pixel information that makes up these land cover classes: green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade. Third, we processed all Landsat scenes with <50% cloud cover. Then, we applied a step-wise random forest machine learning algorithm and empirical decision rules to classify intra-annual and annual land cover classes between 1985 and 2022. Finally, we estimated the yearly land cover changes in forested and non-forested ecosystems and characterized the major change drivers. In 2022, forest covered 78.6% (331.9 Mha) of the Amazon biome, with 1.4% of secondary regrowth in more than 5 years. Total herbaceous covered 15.6% of the area, with the majority of pastureland (13.5%) and the remaining natural grassland. Water was the third largest land cover class with 2.4%, followed by cropland (1.2%) and shrubland (0.4%), with 89% overall accuracy. Most of the forest changes were driven by pasture and cropland conversion, and there are signs that climate change is the primary driver of the loss of aquatic ecosystems. Existing carbon emission models disregard the types of land cover changes presented in the studies. The twenty first century requires a more encompassing and integrated approach to monitoring anthropogenic and climate changes in the Amazon biome for better mitigation, adaptation, and conservation policies.

J	Zhang, F; Wang, J; Ma, L; Tuersun, D				Zhang, Feng; Wang, Jiao; Ma, Li; Tuersun, Dilibaier			OSL chronology reveals Late Pleistocene floods and their impact on landform evolution in the lower reaches of the Keriya River in the Taklimakan Desert	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Taklimakan Desert; flood inundation; dunes; MIS3; LGM; Holocene; deglaciation	QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; TARIM BASIN; LUMINESCENCE; GLACIATION; HOLOCENE; CHINA; DELTA; C-14	The impacts of climate change on the relationship between fluvial processes and dune landform evolution have been studied. However, the chronology data used to examine this relationship are deficient. The Keriya River has a glacial origin in the Kunlun Mountains on the south margin of the Tarim Basin. The river flows into the Taklimakan Desert, the second largest shifting-dune desert in the world. The dry channels and shifting dunes in this area provide an ideal opportunity to investigate fluvial and aeolian landform evolution processes and their relationship with climate change. We investigated this area during 2008-2011 and obtained 18 fluvial sediment samples from 16 sections for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The results show that the ages ranged from 3.4-44.1 ka. Most of the samples (13) were Holocene in age, around 11 ka, 8-9 ka, 5-6.5 ka, 4.6 ka, and 3.4-3.7 ka and were distributed along ancient river channels around sites of Yuansha and Karadun. Two samples close to the Hotan River (38-47 ka) fall within the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3). Three samples (from one section) were located near ancient channels flowing towards the Yuansha Site and had ages of around 14.5 ka, i.e., during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The analyses of the sediment samples and OSL ages suggest that the Keriya River flooded in the Holocene, the LGM, and MIS3. Fluvial sediments provided the source material for the dunes, and fluvial processes affected the landform evolution in the lower Keriya River. Our results suggest that most of the dunes covered in fluvial sediments in the lower reaches and the area west of the Keriya River developed since the Holocene. This differs from the results of previous studies, which suggested that they developed since the Han (202BC-220AD) and Tang (618-907AD) dynasties. The OSL ages of the fluvial sediments are consistent with the reported deglaciation (after glacial advance) ages in the alpine mountains surrounding the Tarim Basin. This suggests that climate fluctuations may have affected the occurrence of floods and the formation of dunes in the Taklimakan Desert.

Rural inundation has become an issue of concern in various parts of the world, including Pakistan. Over the past few decades, it has been hard for local institutions and rural populations to recover from the trauma inflicted by these events. The disaster risk management cycle is a well-known tool for coping with disasters and their consequences. Yet, the DRM cycle efficacy has been questioned in various rural settings. Thus, this paper applied a programmatic strategy to understand the challenges disaster management authorities and communities face in managing flood risks through the conventional disaster management cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. The study objective was accomplished by using both qualitative and exploratory research designs. Four communities (namely, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, and Dera Ismail Khan) with a historical record of flooding were chosen for focus group discussion (32 in total) using a purposive sampling method. Additionally, 31 key informant interviews were undertaken from pertinent local disaster risk management institutions. We employed a thematic analysis to classify responses and obstacles into the various stages of the disaster management cycle. The findings of this study from interviews and focus groups provided some new insight into the conventional DRM cycle. The issues and challenges encountered by institutions and the community members were divided into four stages: 1-mitigation, 2-preparedness, 3-rescue and relief (R&R), and 4-rehabilitation and recovery (R&R). Based on the findings, it seems that local disaster management institutions still rely on reactive strategies and deal with flood hazards on an ad hoc basis. Poor governance and a lack of responses for present development trajectories were also highlighted as reasons why flood risk management is still challenging. There is an urgent need to perform susceptibility and risk assessments for multiple hazards and develop specialized plans that follow disaster risk reduction principles and adaptation to climate change. This study recommends incorporating resilience and adaptation to climate change into the current disaster management cycle to prevent or reduce future hazards and risks in rural areas.

This research aims to investigate the temporal variations of six extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) over 2000-2018 at different SEDLs for the selected 525 sites (considering socioeconomic and weather data availability and completeness) in mainland China and to assess the impacts of SEDL on extreme precipitation events. Six EPIs were selected according to the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), which were: consecutive dry days-(CDD); consecutive wet days-(CWD); simple daily intensity index-(SDII); the 95th percentile of precipitation on wet days-(R95p); maximum 1-day precipitation-(Rx1day); Annual total wet-day precipitation-(PRCPTOT), respectively. As important human activity-indicators, population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 were used to classify the SEDLs. The levels of SEDL for the sites were classified as I to VI, in which the population increased from 50 to >= 1000 x 10(4) and the GDP increased from <100 to >= 10,000 x 10(8) RMB. The Pearson correlations between the linear slopes (LS) of population (Popu(LS)) or GDP(LS) and six EPIs at different SEDLs were conducted to show the impacts of human activities on changes of EPIs over 2000-2018. The variations of six EPILS with the SEDLs were further studied with the Pearson correlation. The results showed that: (1) High risks of extreme precipitation events occurred at SEDL VI, which was highly affected by human activity; and SDII, R95p, Rx1day and PRCPTOT were the highest in 2016, being 15.2 mm day(-1), 545.9 mm, 159.8 mm and 1617.9 mm. (2) There were higher risks of drought occurring for SEDL I, which was least affected by human activity; and three EPIs (R95p, Rx1day and PRCPTOT) were the lowest in 2011, being 156.9 mm, 53.1 mm and 601.6 mm. (3) As the SEDL increased from I to VI, the five EPILS (except CWD) increased and implied increasing risks of extreme flooding events. This research provided useful references for assessing comprehensive influences of human activities on extreme precipitation events.

Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial-and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early -mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.

In developing countries, millions of marginal fishers rely solely on wetlands for security of both nutrition and livelihood. The decline in wetland fisheries owing to anthropogenic and climatic changes has made fishers increasingly vulnerable. Pen culture can be an effective climate-resilient technology for enhancing fish production in shallow, macrophyte-choked, and multi-stake floodplain wetlands, especially in eastern and north-eastern India. In this context, pen culture was implemented as an adaptive measure in a tropical Gangetic wetland (Mathura) to enhance fish production and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers. Indian Major Carps, Gibelion catla, Labeo rohita, and Cirrhinus mrigala of initial size 10.4 +/-.21g, 8.2 +/- 0.48g, and 6.5 +/- 0.23g respectively, were stocked at the ratio of 4:4:2 and at the rate of 30 fish m(-2) each in pens of 100 m(2) in duplicate. For purposes of conservation, Labeo bata and Gudusia chapra, 4.3 +/- 0.18g and 3.8 +/-.34g initial size, respectively, were stocked at the rate of 20 Nos.m(-2) each at the ratio of 1:1. The fish were fed with commercial feed at the rate of 4% of body weight. A net survival of 82%, 87%, and 75% was recorded in Indian Major Carps, L. bata and G. chapra. A production of 380 kg IMC was achieved during 120 days of the culture period. L. bata achieved an average weight of 21.40 +/- 0.34g during the 90-day culture period, with a survival rate of 87%. G. chapra attained an average weight of 16.5 +/- 0.42g during the culture period, with a recorded survival rate of 75%. G. chapra was observed to spawn in the pen. The water quality inside pens and reference sites did not differ significantly (p>0.05). The produced fish were released in the wetland for fisheries enhancement. The present communication discusses the technological suitability and economic feasibility of adopting climate-resilient pen culture as an adaptation measure for enhancing the adaptive capacity of wetland fishers in the face of a changing climate.

J	Kim, JB; Bae, DH				Kim, Jeong-Bae; Bae, Deg-Hyo			Intensification characteristics of hydroclimatic extremes in the Asian monsoon region under 1.5 and 2.0 °C of global warming	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; EAST-ASIA; 1.5-DEGREES-C; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; 2-DEGREES-C; MODEL; WATER	Understanding the influence of global warming on regional hydroclimatic extremes is challenging. To reduce the potential risk of extremes under future climate states, assessing the change in extreme climate events is important, especially in Asia, due to spatial variability of climate and its seasonal variability. Here, the changes in hydroclimatic extremes are assessed over the Asian monsoon region under global mean temperature warming targets of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C above preindustrial levels based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Analyses of the subregions classified using regional climate characteristics are performed based on the multimodel ensemble mean (MME) of five bias-corrected global climate models (GCMs). For runoff extremes, the hydrologic responses to 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C global warming targets are simulated based on the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. Changes in temperature extremes show increasing warm extremes and decreasing cold extremes in all climate zones with strong robustness under global warming conditions. However, the hottest extreme temperatures occur more frequently in low-latitude regions with tropical climates. Changes in mean annual precipitation and mean annual runoff and low-runoff extremes represent the large spatial variations with weak robustness based on intermodel agreements. Global warming is expected to consistently intensify maximum extreme precipitation events (usually exceeding a 10 % increase in intensity under 2.0 degrees C of warming) in all climate zones. The precipitation change patterns directly contribute to the spatial extent and magnitude of the high-runoff extremes. Regardless of regional climate characteristics and RCPs, this behavior is expected to be enhanced under the 2.0 degrees C (compared with the 1.5 degrees C) warming scenario and increase the likelihood of flood risk (up to 10 %). More importantly, an extra 0.5 degrees C of global warming under two RCPs will amplify the change in hydroclimatic extremes on temperature, precipitation, and runoff with strong robustness, especially in cold (and polar) climate zones. The results of this study clearly show the consistent changes in regional hydroclimatic extremes related to temperature and high precipitation and suggest that hydroclimatic sensitivities can differ based on regional climate characteristics and type of extreme variables under warmer conditions over Asia.

EJ research regarding water has been predominantly focused on drinking water. This project sought to identify and analyze the breadth of peer-reviewed research on EJ and water beyond drinking water. We conducted a systematic literature review to catalog a representative sample of academic literature on EJ and surface water. We found a focus on freshwater rather than marine EJ research, with the biggest focus on anthropogenic-induced change and management and policy considerations. Distributional and procedural injustices were more commonly investigated than recognitional and capabilities injustices. The most common research efforts were qualitative case studies and larger spatial analyses of disparities. There remains considerable need for research connected to the complex issues of EJ and water.

Rising seas and roadway debris: Microplastic and low-density tire wear particles in street-associated tidal floodwater	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Microplastics; Flooding; Climate change; Rubber; Estuary; Street	SOUTH-CAROLINA; ENVIRONMENT; URBAN	Tidal flooding is increasingly common in low-lying coastal regions as sea levels rise. This type of flooding can occur on sunny days with no rainfall and may transport street-associated debris, such as microplastics (MPs) including tire wear particles (TWPs), to coastal systems. This research aimed to quantify MP abundance in tidal floodwater and investigate their fate. Three locations around Charleston, SC (USA) were sampled during 12 tidal floods, and their adjacent tidal creeks were sampled before and after 5 floods. Floodwater contained an average of 342 +/- 60 MP/L. Most MPs in floodwater were low-density TWP (86.5 %). MP abundance in tidal creek surface water following flooding did not change, suggesting that MPs were not immediately transferred to coastal waterways but deposited in adjacent marsh sediment. Elucidating transport routes of MPs in coastal environments is critical to understanding and preventing this type of contamination in the face of a changing climate.

However, individual differences can also affect risk perception. The present work focused on the link between an individual cognitive mindset (i.e., level of holism) and flood-risk perception. It also assessed the consequences of such a link on public and personal mitigation intentions, taking into account the sense of connection with the environment, the psychological distance from the adverse event, and the role played by previous personal experience with flooding. Our study (N = 191) showed that the individual cognitive style predicted risk perceptions and personal (for both experienced and no-experience groups) and public (only for experienced group) mitigation intentions, through the mediation of the sense of connection with the environment and the psychological distance from the adverse event. Results are discussed in terms of their practical implications for public communication and policies about environmental hazards.

In Glasgow, key hydro-meteorological risks include alluvial and pluvial flooding and overheating. While the need to address these risks are clear, it is equally important to tackle these in a climate just manner. Having understood the benefits Green Infrastructure (GI) can provide in tackling the impact of climate change while ensuring environmental equity for Glasgow, we attempt to assess the equitability of GI distribution in Glasgow especially in relation to the potential for GI to reduce vulnerability and exposure of deprived communities to climate risk in terms of flooding and overheating. We map potential of ecosystem services within urban areas to provide cooling and increase resilience to surface flooding and highlight the geographical mismatch between social deprivation and the preponderance of these ecosystem services. We explore the implications for a 'climate just transition' using GI as a performance indicator.

However, their ability to complement or replace high-resolution local flood maps was not investigated so far. In this paper we compare pan-European estimates of extreme sea levels and coastal flood extents at given return periods with observations and high-resolution reference maps. The analysis is done for two pan-European assessments and one global study. We find that whereas the models have good accuracy in estimating storm surge heights, large disparities exist between the large-scale flood maps and four local maps of flood extents from England, the Netherlands, Poland, and France. Moreover, the accuracy of the underlying digital elevation model and assumptions about flood protection existing in a given area influence significantly the results. In addition, the first pan-European projection of temporal trends in the size of flood zones is presented, with and without assuming flood protection levels.

Changes in climate and land use are anticipated to alter statistical properties of inflow to these infrastructure systems and potentially increase their hydrological failure probability. Because of large socioeconomic repercussions of infrastructure incidents, revisiting dam failure risks associated with possible shifts in the streamflow regime is fundamental for societal resilience. Here we compute historical and projected flood return periods as a proxy for potential changes in the risk of hydrological failure of dams in a warming climate. Our results show that hydrological failure probability is likely to increase for most dams in California by 2100. Noticeably, the New Don Pedro, Shasta, Lewiston, and Trinity Dams are associated with highest potential changes in flood hazard.

Water Use Dynamics in Double Cropping of Rainfed Upland Rice and Irrigated Melons Produced Under Drought-Prone Tropical Conditions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						eddy covariance; seasonally dry tropics; agricultural intensification; drought; water use efficiency; Central America	EDDY-COVARIANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOTPRINT ASSESSMENT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; EFFICIENCY; BLUE; CONSUMPTION; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; L.	Agricultural expansion and intensification is occurring in seasonally dry regions of Central America, while droughts are intensifying due to increasing water demand and climatic change. Empirical measurements of water consumption of major crops in this region are scarce but crucial to assess agricultural water use dynamics in the light of increasing regional water conflicts. We empirically quantify total crop water use (CWU) and water footprints (WFs) of rainfed upland rice (wet season) and groundwater-irrigated melons (dry season) grown sequentially as a double cropping system, one of the major cropping systems in the seasonally dry province of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. Data for this study cover 2years and were measured with a state-of-the-art eddy covariance water and carbon flux station. Upland rice only consumed green water (CWUgreen=383L/m(2)), while melons only consumed blue water (CWUblue=177L/m(2)). Irrigation was found to be 1.5 times larger than the actual melon water consumption, with better irrigation efficiencies than reported for melon farms in Brazil but slightly inferior to farms in Spain. Melon WFblue was 79m(3)/t, a much lower value than global and regional estimates reported but similar to values reported for melons produced in Brazil or Spain. Upland rice WFgreen (681m(3)/t) was reported for the first time and was proven to be much lower than flood irrigated-rice WFblue-green. Our results demonstrated lower overall water demand for upland rice-melon double crop compared to the two other major monocultures of the region (flood-irrigated rice and irrigated sugar cane). Plain Language Summary Agricultural intensification is occurring in seasonally dry tropical areas. At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe due to climate change in many tropical regions. Empirical measurements of water usage in agriculture and water use efficiency are scarce in the tropics but are critical to achieving sustainable water management and resilient agricultural systems. We instrumented a production farm in the seasonally dry Guanacaste province of Costa Rica to measure agricultural water use for a regionally widespread double cropping system composed of irrigated melons and rainfed rice grown sequentially during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. For rice, 681m(3) of rainwater was used per ton of yield, which is much less water than the water used to produce rice in flooded fields. Seventy-nine cubic meters of irrigated water was used per ton of melons, which is similar to values reported for melons produced in Brazil or Spain. Irrigation of melons was found to be 1.5 times larger than crop water consumption during the dry season, and irrigation efficiencies were similar to Brazilian melon farms but slightly inferior to Spanish farms. We showed that the studied system used considerably less water than did two principal monocultures in the region (irrigated rice and irrigated sugar cane). This cropping system seems a competitive option for the Central American wet-dry tropics in terms of water use.

J	Dolan, W; Pavelsky, TM; Yang, X				Dolan, Wayana; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.; Yang, Xiao			Functional Lake-to-Channel Connectivity Impacts Lake Ice in the Colville Delta, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						Arctic deltas; lake connectivity; lake ice; remote sensing of water color	HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; MACKENZIE DELTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ARCTIC LAKE; RIVER; WATER; METHANE; THAW; CLASSIFICATION	Within Arctic deltas, surficial hydrologic connectivity of lakes to nearby river channels influences physical processes like sediment transport and ice phenology as well as biogeochemical processes such as photochemistry. As the Arctic hydrologic cycle is impacted by climate change, it is important to quantify temporal variability in connectivity. However, current connectivity detection methods are either spatially limited due to data availability constraints or have been applied at only a single time. Additionally, the relationship between connectivity and lake ice is still poorly quantified. In this study, we present a multitemporal classification of functional lake connectivity in the Colville River Delta, Alaska. We introduce a connectivity detection algorithm based on remote sensing of high sediment river water recharge that is expandable to other high sediment Arctic deltas. We compare results to three existing data sets, producing 64.4%, 75.8%, and 85.2% lake classification accuracy. Mismatches between the data sets are often due to inconsistencies in methodology or definition of connectivity. Connectivity varies temporally in about 10% of studied lakes and correlates strongly with discharge and lake elevation, supporting the idea that future changes in discharge will be a driver of changes in connectivity. Highly connected lakes start and end ice break up an average of 26 and 17 days earlier, respectively, compared to lakes that are poorly connected. Because spring and summer ice conditions drive Arctic lake photochemistry processes, our research suggests that surface connectivity is an important parameter to consider when studying biogeochemistry of Arctic delta lakes. Plain Language Summary Arctic deltas contain a complex tapestry of channels and lakes. Lakes can be isolated from channels or connected to channels-either by feeder channels, other lakes, or by water movement over land during flooding. This connectivity is important because it impacts the movement of sediment, light penetration through water, and when lake ice forms and disappears. While we anticipate future changes in connectivity due to climate change, our ability to monitor connectivity is limited to individual deltas or single instances in time. Additionally, the relationship between lake ice and connectivity is poorly understood. In this study, we used a method based on satellite observations of sediment in water to examine lake connectivity variations within the Colville River Delta, Alaska. We found that most lakes stay connected or disconnected, but that about 10% of lakes have variable connectivity. These lakes are more likely to be connected when river discharge is high. Additionally, lake ice tends to break up earlier and last for a shorter period of time in connected lakes. Because lake ice conditions drive chemical interaction between sunlight and organic compounds in the water, connectivity is important to consider when studying the biology and chemistry of Arctic delta lakes. Key Points We have developed an algorithm using optical properties of lakes and channels to detect lake-to-channel connectivity in an Arctic delta We show that this algorithm can be used to detect lakes where functional connectivity varies based on maximum summer discharge Differences in functional connectivity drive lake ice phenology, which is likely important for photochemical processes	[Dolan, Wayana; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.; Yang, Xiao] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA	University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill	Dolan, W (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.	whyana@live.unc.edu		Dolan, Wayana/0000-0001-8405-4302	NASA FINESST [80NSSC19K1344]; UNC Preston Jones and Mary Elizabeth Frances Dean Martin Fellowship Fund	NASA FINESST; UNC Preston Jones and Mary Elizabeth Frances Dean Martin Fellowship Fund	The authors thank Dr. Anastasia Piliouras for providing MATLAB files containing connectivity information from Piliouras and Rowland (2020).

This paper investigates the precipitation variability over the whole country of Morocco. To that end, a monthly precipitation dataset of 78 rain gauges with more than 40 years of observation was used to investigate the spatial-temporal variability of precipitation. Moreover, the spatio-temporal trends variation was also assessed through a comparative analysis of the various trend detection methods (both old and new tests). The new methods were used also to identify non-monotonic sub-trends. The results highlighted that (1) Morocco has experienced considerably larger variations regarding the temporal variability of precipitations and their spatial distribution during the last few decades; (2) the greatest variability of precipitation was observed moving latitudinally from humid to arid regions; (3) the annual precipitation exhibited positive and negative trends where there was no clear evidence of upward or downward trends. The significant trends are identified for 5(6,41%), 6 (7,69%), 3 (3,84%), and 65 (83%) stations from the results of the MK test, SR test, Onyutha???s method, and ITA method, respectively. (4) the MK, SR, and Onyutha methods exhibited similar trends which indicate that are in perfect concordance. The ITA method showed also some resemblance with the results of other methods even though it proved to be over-sensitive in determining trend significance; and (5) the highlands with a Mediterranean climate are prone to flooding whereas the regions with desertic and semi-arid climates are prone to drought. Overall, our findings allow policy-makers to properly design adaptation strategies for changing precipitation patterns as well as increasing extreme events (floods and droughts). <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Bouizrou, Ismail; Bouadila, Abdelmounim] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci & Tech, Funct Ecol & Environm Engn Lab, Fes, Morocco; [Aqnouy, Mourad] Moulay Isma l Univ Meknes, Fac Sci & Tech, Appl Geol Res Lab, Appl Geol & Remote Sensing Res Team, Errachidia, Morocco	Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez; Moulay Ismail University of Meknes	Bouizrou, I (corresponding author), Fac Sci & Tech, Route Immouzer 2202, Fes, Morocco.	ismail.bouizrou@usmba.ac.ma	Aqnouy, Mourad/CAI-4060-2022	Aqnouy, Mourad/0000-0003-1633-2870; BOUIZROU, Ismail/0000-0002-9446-0838					119	8	8	1	8	PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD	OXFORD	THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND	1464-343X	1879-1956		J AFR EARTH SCI	J.

However, species growth responses are poorly understood. We measured annual stem growth of 27 different tree species from upland and seasonally flooded forests and woodlands in the Cuiaba Basin and Northern Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Stem growth increment was measured using plastic, spring-loaded dendrometer bands installed on 344 trees. Measurements were made between 2015 and 2019, which encompassed the 2015-16 El Nin similar to o that was one of the warmest and driest on record. Relative stem growth rates (RGR) at both sites increased with higher rainfall and declined with an increase in maximum temperature, but the RGR of trees in the Cuiaba Basin also declined as the length of the dry season increased. RGR, and the response of RGR to climate variation, varied substantially across species. Some species only exhibited a significant RGR response to variations in rainfall, maximum temperature, or dry season length, other species responded to more than one climate variable, and a subset were insensitive to the variation in all three climate variables studied. Rainfall appeared to be a stronger control on RGR in the predominately upland Cuiaba Basin (87% of species exhibited a significant RGR response to rainfall in the Cuiaba Basin vs. 39% in the Pantanal) while temperature was a stronger control on RGR in the seasonally flooded Pantanal (67% of species exhibited a significant RGR response to temperature in the Pantanal vs. 53% in the Cuiaba Basin). While our study period was short, and measurements were done on a small subset of available species, our data indicate that variations in climate affect the growth of tropical forest and woodland tree species differently. These species-specific responses have the potential to alter community diversity and productivity as climate change ensues.

Cities suffer from natural shocks and human-made disturbances due to rapid urbanization and global climate change. The construction of an urban resilient developmental environment is restricted by these factors. Strengthening the comprehensive evaluation of resilience is conducive to identifying high-risk areas in cities, guiding regional risk prevention, and providing a scientific basis for differentiated strategies for urban resilience governance. For this study, taking Shenyang city as a case study, the resilience index system was constructed as an ECP ("exposure", "connectedness", and "potential") framework, and the adaptive cycle model was introduced into the resilience assessment framework. This model not only comprehensively considers the relationship between exposure and potential but also helps to focus on the temporal and spatial dynamics of urban resilience. The results show that the exposed indicators have experienced three spatial evolution stages, including single-center circle expansion, multicenter clustering, and multicenter expansion. The potential index increased radially from the downtown area to the outer suburbs, and the low-value area presented a multicenter pattern. The spatial agglomeration of connectivity indicators gradually weakened. The results reflect the fact that the resilience level of the downtown area has been improved and the resilience of the outer expansion area has declined due to urban construction. The multicenter cluster pattern is conducive to the balance of resilience levels. In terms of the adaptive cycle phases of urban resilience, the first ring has gone through three phases: exploitation (r), conservation (K), and release (omega). The second and third rings have gradually shifted from the exploitation (r) phase to the conservation (K) phase. The fourth ring has entered the exploitation (r) phase from the reorganization (alpha) phase. The fifth ring and its surrounding areas are in the reorganization (alpha) phase. The results provide specific spatial guidance for implementing resilient urban planning and realizing sustainable urban development.

J	Becker, P				Becker, Per			Tightly coupled policies and loosely coupled networks in the governing of flood risk mitigation in municipal administrations	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						flood risk; governance; institutional fit; institutionalism	WATER GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONS	Flood risk is a complex and transboundary issue that is expected to escalate with climate change and requires to be governed by collaborative networks of actors. Municipal administrations have been suggested to have a particularly important and challenging role in such governance. Although collaborative governance has attracted intense scientific attention, empirical studies generally focus either on the macro-level institutions per se, or on the meso-level interaction between organizations, without corresponding attention to the micro-level interactions between the individual actors constituting the organizations and reproducing the institutions. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of how flood risk is governed within municipal administrations, by studying how actors interact within them when implementing tightly coupled policies. The paper draws on comparative case study research of three Swedish municipal administrations (Lomma, Lund, and Staffanstorp). Data were collected through interviews with all 143 actors actively contributing to mitigating flood risk within the municipal administrations, and analyzed structurally and interpretatively using social network analysis and qualitative analysis. Although the Swedish legal framework consists of tightly coupled policies demanding coordination between the actors implementing them, there is a recurrent pattern of relative integration between actors implementing policies for planning and water and sewage, and substantial separation between them and actors implementing policy for risk and vulnerability. This cinderellic fragmentation generates a "problem of fit" between the legal framework and the collaborative networks implementing it, which undermines the effectiveness of flood risk mitigation in municipal administrations. It is not accidental but a consequence of a directional separation of institutionalization, where the more bottom-up and problem-oriented institutionalization of practices in planning and water and sewage, and the more top-down and compliance-oriented institutionalization of practices in risk and vulnerability pull the network of actors apart. I demonstrate how the mechanisms of increasing returns, commitments, and objectification may all operate simultaneously but to various degrees in different practices across any collaborative governance network. Hence, potentially undermining policy coherence, policy integration, and collaborative governance.

New and existing habitats may risk additional SLR-related degradation from non-native species transmission, groundwater pollution, and increased contact with human infrastructure. Despite a worldwide distribution, anchialine ecosystems and biota have been largely omitted from SLR risk assessments for coastal ecosystems. Anchialine pools and caves are composed of brackish groundwater that connects to the marine environment through porous rocky substrate but have no overland connection to the ocean. They support unique endemic biota. The goal of this study was to develop methods to assess potential impacts to anchialine pools from future coastal flooding, using the island of Hawai'i as a case study. Flood predictions incorporated pool surveys, groundwater-level measurements, and statistical analysis of flood frequencies observed in tide gauges combined with regional scenario-based projections of future sea levels. High-resolution geospatial models were then generated to predict anchialine pool location, density, and risk factors for the next 60 years. Along 40 km of coastline, up to 80% of current anchialine pools will be lost by 2080 as pools merge with ocean habitats; however, as groundwater flooding occurs more frequently and new habitats are created inland, the total pool counts will rise from 509 in 2018 to 1,000 by 2080. As a result of extreme water-level events, non-native fishes are predicted to disperse into 42% of pools by 2030. Based on current conditions, development and cesspool risks are quite low for anchialine pools in the study area. Outcomes from this study are guiding conservation actions, including habitat restoration, non-native fish removal, and development planning decisions in coastal areas. This study illustrates methods that can be used to assess the effects of SLR on anchialine pool habitats worldwide.

First Record of White- tailed Deer Depredating Saltmarsh Sparrow Nests	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							PREDATION; SEASIDE; SUCCESS	Ammospiza caudacuta (Saltmarsh Sparrow) is a salt marsh-nesting obligate species of greatest conservation concern due to decreasing populations and probable future threats, such as climate change-induced sea-level rise. Low reproductive success is a limiting factor to population growth for the species due to flooding, habitat loss, and predation. To further understand the effects of predation on nesting Saltmarsh Sparrows, we deployed camera traps at monitored nests in Jacob's Point salt marsh, Warren, RI, during the 2022 breeding period. In 2 instances of observed nest failure, camera traps captured the apparent depredation of eggs by Odocoileus virginianus ( White- tailed Deer). We believe these to be the first documented cases of Saltmarsh Sparrow nest predation by White-tailed Deer. This finding has implications for the conservation of Saltmarsh Sparrows and for future management strategies aimed at increasing breeding success.

To mitigate flood damage, evacu-ation of the area may sometimes be recommended. However, inhabitants' willingness and pre-paredness to evacuate flood-prone areas has yet to be investigated comprehensively. In this study, the factors that determine people's intention to prepare for evacuation in case of urban flood disasters are investigated by a questionnaire survey of people living in the Minato, Shinagawa, Meguro, and Ota wards located in the Jyonan area river basin of Tokyo. The results of the covariance structure analysis reveal that the higher the "interest in flood damage" and the "benefit perception" of evacuation behavior, the more people tend to consider evacuation preparation. Thus, the study results can be used to prepare strategies to mitigate flood damage in the future.

However, studies vary widely in the shocks and type of migration measured, the context, and the strength and direction of environmental effects. In addition, existing theories provide opposing predictions for this relationship. There is a clear need for further theoretical development in the climate-migration literature. This study, in rural Nepal, examines four types of weather shocks, over various time frames, on four types of migration. Results suggest that the most substantial influence of weather shocks is not in a wholesale increase or decrease in migration. Instead, weather shocks are related to changes in the type of migration used, resulting in less long-term and more short-term migrations in the population. We use the ready-willing-and-able perspective to make sense of these patterns.

For many, this includes storm surge flooding fueled by tropical storms and hurricanes. A complex mesh of social, geomorphic, and climatic factors are driving this increase in vulnerability, such as population growth, irresponsible urban development, a decrease in essential service provision, shoreline erosion, sea level rise, and changing storm regimes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the interrelationships between these factors, highlighting the many ways in which they contribute to somewhat unexpected vulnerabilities for coastal settlements. This includes a discussion and several examples of how short-term strategic planning, which dominates political action and economic decision-making, can exacerbate coastal vulnerability.

Building a highresilience social system, an important means of sustainable flood control, can address these flood-related issues. Numerous studies have carried out disaster resilience evaluations and explored the correlation between flood disaster loss and intensity, but neglected to analyze the role of resilience construction in disaster loss reduction. This study proposed a research route for linking flood loss and disaster loss to quantify the relationship between the two. Take Guangdong Province, China as a study case, the mixed-effects (ME) model and multilevel hybrid evaluation model (MHEM) were established to assess disaster loss and resilience of cities, respectively. Subsequently, disaster resilience curves were built to quantitatively evaluate disaster resilience and corresponding disaster loss. The results show that (1) the ME model can concurrently build the disaster intensity-loss curves of multiple cities with high fitting accuracy. The MHEM combines multiple methods to determine the evaluation result with the highest consistency, showing high reliability. (2) The central and southern regions of Guangdong Province have low disaster loss and high resilience, while the northern regions have high disaster loss and low resilience. (3) With the improvement of disaster resistance, the reduction in disaster loss gradually decreases. Disaster loss in low-resilience cities exhibits greater randomness than that in high-resilience cities, and increasing their resilience can more significantly reduce their level of loss. This study provides a quantitative basis and available methods for comprehensive responses to natural disasters and adaptation to global climate change.

Flood impact assessments rely heavily on models, and understanding the effects of uncertainties encompassed in the modelling chain is critical to adequately interpret flood risk and the development of effective flood adaptation measures. Previous research has focused on the effects of processes embedded in models, and flood frequency analysis of flood risk. However, no study has yet evaluated the cascading effects of flood damage assessment methodologies on uncertainty in the estimation of expected annual damage (EAD), optimal flood protection, and residual flood damage (RFD). Here, using an updated global river and inundation model forced by the latest climate data and employing a standard flood methodology, we found that global EAD will increase by $16.2 (USD throughout) and $44.5 billion yr(-1) during 2020-2100 under low- and high-emissions scenarios, respectively. During the same period, despite the adoption of optimal levels of flood protections, global total RFD remained high under both low- and high-emissions scenarios, at $25.8 and $36.2 billion yr(-1), respectively. Our results demonstrate that, under current levels of flood protection, EAD will approximately double with a switch in methodology. Aggregating data at the regional scale revealed conflicting trends between methodologies for developing and high-income countries, driven by existing levels of flood protection as well as the intensity, evolution, and distribution of gross domestic product at the administrative unit scale. Flood damage methodology is the dominant source of uncertainty, followed by unit construction cost and discount rate.

The most devalued lands, such as mangroves and floodplains, were occupied by the low-income population. The proposal highlighted in this project focuses directly on the problem of rising sea levels and flooding in the urban space of Macae, which is of social interest. A simulation of future scenarios with sea level rise above the current one, allowing the identification of areas flooded by marine transgression on a time scale of 100 years (for the year 2100). For this, the rate was chosen for the simulation: the greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.5, as given in IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of 2014. A radiative forcing that corresponds to more than 700 ppm CO2-eq, but less than 1500 ppm, the projected increase is 1 m to more than 3 m (medium confidence) and more than 3 m (medium confidence). This assessment is based on the average confidence in the contribution from thermal expansion and low confidence in the modeled contribution modeled contribution of the ice sheets. Therefore, the climate change-induced global mean sea level rise is caused by thermal expansion of ocean water and ocean mass gain, the latter being mainly due to a decrease in land ice mass. The estimated sea-level rise used for the projection of this study is 2.15, as proposed by Grinsted et al. in 2009.

Nesting loggerhead females do not extend parental protection beyond depositing eggs in sandy, excavated nests in locations that provide a viable range of temperatures, moisture, and respiratory gas exchange. Thereafter, a female's clutches are subjected to the uncertainties of desiccation, predation, flooding, or beach erosion. MethodsHere, we used data from a 1996-2004 study of 94 tagged loggerhead females nesting on a small barrier island off the Gulf Coast of south Florida, United States. We tested the hypothesis that the distribution of nest sites by loggerhead females was a randomized response to unpredictable hatching failure. ResultsWe show that nest site choice accounted for 19.2% of variation in hatching success whereas breeding year and breeding month accounted for the remaining 81.8% of variation in hatching success. We show that the emergence site along the beach-length axis, nest site choice along the beach-width axis, and distances between nest locations did not fit a uniform-random distribution or a normal distribution. Instead, we show that loggerhead females employed a "Goldilocks" distribution in which nest sites were "neither too clustered nor too dispersed." Moreover, loggerhead females selected nest sites with limited overlap with nest sites from previous breeding seasons. DiscussionWe propose that nest site choice by this population of loggerhead females constitutes a significant maternal risk-management adaptation that deserves thoughtful consideration as we continue to assess the impacts of climate change on the future of loggerhead sea turtles.

Exploring trade-offs between SDGs for Indus River Dolphin conservation and human water security in the regulated Beas River, India	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Sustainable development goals; Dams and barrages; Punjab; Floodplain rivers; Indus Dolphin; Conservation planning	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS; WESTERN DISTURBANCES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; 20-1ST CENTURY; HARIKE WETLAND; FUTURE CLIMATE; BASIN; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; PUNJAB	In India's Indo-Gangetic plains, river flows are strongly altered by dams, barrages and water diversions for irrigation, urban supply, hydropower production and flood control. Human demands for freshwater are likely to intensify with climatic and socio-economic changes, exacerbating trade-offs between different sustainable development goals (SDGs) dependent on freshwater (e.g. SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG11 and SDG15). Freshwater ecosystems and endangered aquatic species are not explicitly addressed in the SDGs, but only nested as targets within SDG6 and SDG15. Thus, there is high risk that decisions to advance other SDGs may overlook impacts on them. In this study, we link a water resource systems model and a forecast extinction risk model to analyze how alternative conservation strategies in the regulated Beas River (India) affect the likelihood of survival of the only remaining population of endangered Indus River Dolphins (IRD) in India in the face of climate change-induced impacts on river hydrology and human water demands, explicitly accounting for potential trade-offs between related SDGs. We find that the frequency of low flow released from the main reservoir may increase under some climate change scenarios, significantly affecting the IRD population. The strongest trade-offs exist between the persistence of IRD, urban water supply and hydropower generation. The establishment of ecologically informed reservoir releases combined with IRD population supplementation enhances the probability of survival of the IRD and is compatible with improving the status of relevant SDGs. This will require water managers, conservation scientists, and other stakeholders to continue collaborating to develop holistic water management strategies.

Yet, the lack of regional and local information on marine drivers is a major drawback that coastal decision-makers face to anticipate the impacts of climate change along the Maldivian coastlines. In this study we focus on wind-waves, the main driver of extremes causing coastal flooding in the region. We dynamically downscale large-scale fields from global wave models, providing a valuable source of climate information along the coastlines with spatial resolution down to 500 m. This dataset serves to characterise the wave climate around the Maldives, with applications in regional development and land reclamation, and is also an essential input for local flood hazard modelling. We illustrate this with a case study of HA Hoarafushi, an atoll island where local topo-bathymetry is available. This island is exposed to the highest incoming waves in the archipelago and recently saw development of an airport island on its reef via land reclamation. Regional waves are propagated toward the shoreline using a phase-resolving model and coastal inundation is simulated under different mean sea level rise conditions of up to 1 m above present-day mean sea level. The results are represented as risk maps with different hazard levels gathering inundation depth and speed, providing a clear evidence of the impacts of the sea level rise combined with extreme wave events.

The aim of this study is to analyse the changing protective functions of forests in the upper plain of the Jizera Mts. (North Bohemia, Czech Republic) since the second half of the 19th century. With time, forests have gradually changed from native stands to spruce plantations (Picea antes), introducing exotic conifers (more resistant to air pollution), and, recently, back to more diverse mixed stands. The priority in protective forest functions there shifted from flood protection to integrated control of water resources (quantity and quality). In the 1980s, forest - water interactions were degraded by consequences of extreme acid atmospheric deposition, forest die-back, and extensive clear-cut. In the Jizerka catchment, first signs of recovery were observed in the early 1990s, but, stream waters there are still affected by prolonged acidification. While reconstruction of stream water chemistry at Jizerka follows the drop of the acid deposition in some 5 years, the revival of stream biota takes 10-15 years. In 2071-2100, the projected climate change shows rising annual air temperatures by 3.0-4.6 degrees C, decreasing water yield by 65 -123 mm, 60% drop in 'minimum residual discharge', and 20-30% rise in peak-flows. However, these projected environmental changes cannot substantially decline the high potential in water resource recharge, or, start reverse processes in recent recovery from acidification and radically affect the existence of planned mixed forests in the upper plain of the Jizera Mts.

To identify the main issues that affect crop production and the decisions of farmers, a survey was conducted in three different agro-ecosystems in Bhutan. Our key findings indicate that farming and the decisions of farmers were largely affected by different climatic and non-climatic factors. These were in descending order of importance: irrigation availability > farm labour > crop seasonality > crop damage (climatic) > land holding > crop damage (wildlife) > crop damage (diseases and pests). The most important consequences of climate change impacts were the drying of irrigation sources (4.35) and crop losses due to weather events (4.10), whereas land fallowing, the occurrence of flood and soil erosion, weed pressure and changes in cropping pattern (with mean ratings of 2.53-3.03) experienced lesser consequences. The extreme weather events, such as untimely rains, drought and windstorms, were rated as the 'most common' to 'common' occurrences, thus inflicting a crop loss of 1-19%. These confirm our hearsay knowledge that extreme weather events have major consequences on irrigation water, which is said to be either drying or getting smaller in comparison to the past. Therefore, Bhutan must step up its on-ground farmer-support system towards improving the country's food production, whilst embracing climate smart farm technologies for adapting to the impacts of change.

In contrast, global precipitation and evaporation are constrained by the Earth's energy balance to increase at similar to 2-3%/degrees C. However, this rate of increase is suppressed by rapid atmospheric adjustments in response to greenhouse gases and absorbing aerosols that directly alter the atmospheric energy budget. Rapid adjustments to forcings, cooling effects from scattering aerosol, and observational uncertainty can explain why observed global precipitation responses are currently difficult to detect but are expected to emerge and accelerate as warming increases and aerosol forcing diminishes. Precipitation increases with warming are expected to be smaller over land than ocean due to limitations on moisture convergence, exacerbated by feedbacks and affected by rapid adjustments. Thermodynamic increases in atmospheric moisture fluxes amplify wet and dry events, driving an intensification of precipitation extremes. The rate of intensification can deviate from a simple thermodynamic response due to in-storm and larger-scale feedback processes, while changes in large-scale dynamics and catchment characteristics further modulate the frequency of flooding in response to precipitation increases. Changes in atmospheric circulation in response to radiative forcing and evolving surface temperature patterns are capable of dominating water cycle changes in some regions. Moreover, the direct impact of human activities on the water cycle through water abstraction, irrigation, and land use change is already a significant component of regional water cycle change and is expected to further increase in importance as water demand grows with global population.

The spatial variability of rainfall can affect streamflow and sediment transport volumes and peaks. Yet, the effect of climate change on the small-scale spatial structure of heavy rainfall and subsequent impacts on hydrology and geomorphology remain largely unexplored. In this study, the sensitivity of the hydro-morphological response to heavy rainfall at the small-scale resolution of minutes and hundreds of metres was investigated. A numerical experiment was conducted in which synthetic rainfall fields representing heavy rainfall events of two types, stratiform and convective, were simulated using a space-time rainfall generator model. The rain-fall fields were modified to follow different spatial rainfall scenarios associated with increasing temperatures and used as inputs into a landscape evolution model. The experiment was conducted over a complex topography, a medium-sized (477 km(2)) Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. It was found that the responses of the streamflow and sediment yields are highly sensitive to changes in total rainfall volume and to a lesser extent to changes in local peak rainfall intensities. The results highlight that the morphological components are more sensitive to changes in rainfall spatial structure in comparison to the hydrological components. The hydro-morphological features were found to respond more to convective rainfall than stratiform rainfall because of localized runoff and erosion production. It is further shown that assuming heavy rainfall to intensify with increasing temperatures without introducing changes in the rainfall spatial structure might lead to overestimation of future climate impacts on basin hydro-morphology.

The global rising temperature is supposed to alter climatic patterns like floods and droughts, thereby affecting human life supporting system and global food production. In order to clarify the impact of weather events on agricultural production in karst landforms, this study selected the indices of the growth period of crops (start time and duration), growing season precipitation, intense precipitation, number of consecutive rainless days, and number of drought-flood abrupt alternation events to evaluate the variation trend of future weather events and their impact on crop growth in Guizhou Province, China. The results show that (1) the climate is generally getting warmer. From 2019 to 2050, the sowing period of winter wheat and rice tends to be postponed. The duration of maize and rice's growth period will be shortened, and the life cycle of wheat also emerges as having a decreasing tendency except for those from the southern region. Comparing with the mean value during 1961 to 2018, the average crop cycle length of winter wheat, summer maize, and rice was shortened. The rate of shortening of crop cycle length is faster than the value during 1961 to 2018. (2) In the next 30 years, extreme precipitation concentrates in June and mainly falls in the central and southeast parts of Guizhou Province. In addition, summer is the outbreak period of drought events and drought-flood abrupt alternation events, which has a great impact on crop's growth. This study can provide references for the planting system, structure, layout, and management of crops in the karst region.

The increasing frequency of heat waves and their influence on the rise in mortality in big cities suggest that the thermal hazard (long-term occurrence of high air temperature) is one of the key climatic hazards of present times. The global temperature rise, reinforced in urbanized areas by the anthropogenic heat flux, leads to intensified convection processes and increased precipitation, especially torrential rain. One of the most important hydrological hazards in a big conurbation is the urban flood hazard. In this paper the identified climatic hazards occurring in a big city are analysed: the thermal hazard and the urban flood hazard. The areas currently exposed to thermal and urban flood hazards in Warsaw are identified and assessed in terms of the hazard level. The results obtained are verified with the data from meteorological measuring stations (the thermal hazard) and from the Fire Department interventions connected with rainfall and flooding (the urban flood hazard). A map of hydro-meteorological hazards was created by combining thermal hazard and urban flood hazard maps. The approach combining the exposure to thermal and urban flood hazards, presented in this study, uses widely accessible spatial data and can be applied to any location. It can also play a significant role in assessing the adaptation of urban areas to climate change and be an important source of information on the current exposure to hydro-meteorological hazards as well as their possible increase.

Based on an analysis of urban climate characteristics in 2,264 Chinese cities from 1958 to 2017, this study evaluated urban flood and drought risks. The results demonstrated that the annual average values of precipitation, aridity index, frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and extreme drought events differed significantly in these cities. The values of the above six climatic indicators in the cities ranged from 9.29-2639.30 mm, 0.47-54.73, 1.08-8.79 time, 7.82107.25 mm, 0.76-2.99 time, and 10.30-131.19 days, respectively. The geographical patterns of urban precipitation, aridity index, intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and drought events in China fit well to the Hu-Huanyong Line that was created in 1940s to identify the pattern of population distribution. Extreme precipitation in most cities has upward trends, except for those around the Hu-Huanyong Line. The extreme drought events had upward trends in the cities east of the Hu-Huanyong Line, but there were downward trends in the cities west of the line. The risk assessment indicated that 3.80% cities were facing serious flood and 6.01% cities were facing serious drought risks, which are located in the coast of southern China and northwestern China, respectively, and other 90.19% cities were facing different types of drought and flood risks in terms of their intensity and frequency.

Estuarine salinity extremes: Using the Coastal Salinity Index to quantify the role of droughts, floods, hurricanes, and freshwater flow alteration	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Coastal Salinity Index; Estuary; Salinity; Drought; Hurricane; Flood	SALT-MARSH DIEBACK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MISSISSIPPI DELTA; PERKINSUS-MARINUS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SEA-LEVEL; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; EVENTS; PRECIPITATION	In the face of accelerating climate change, advancing understanding of how extreme climatic events influence estuarine salinities can help to inform resource management. Extreme salinities driven by droughts, hurricanes, floods, and freshwater flow alterations can lead to ecological transformations in estuarine ecosystems. Here, we applied the Coastal Salinity Index (CSI; Conrads and Darby 2017) to 22 years (1998-2020) of salinity data in a Louisiana estuary (Barataria Estuary, USA) to elucidate the impacts of extreme events on estuarine salinities. The CSI is an index to quantify salinity patterns at a specific location through long-term averages and deviations from historical average conditions. We calculated and compared CSI values for four stations distributed along an estuarine salinity gradient. We identified 10 events between 1998 and 2020 that produced extreme salinities, including two droughts, four hurricanes, three floods, and one freshwater diversion. The droughts of 2000 and 2006 caused surface water salinities to increase substantially throughout the estuary. The effects of hurricanes were highly variable, with some storms leading to elevated salinities throughout the entire estuary (e.g., Hur-ricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005), whereas other storms led to elevated salinities for some but not all stations (e. g., Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008 or Hurricane Isaac in 2012). The opening of a freshwater river diversion in 2010 contributed to fresher conditions throughout the estuary and appeared to reduce or eliminate the increases in salinity that normally occur during the summer, although these effects were short-lived. Mississippi River floods in 2008, 2011, and 2019 reduced salinities throughout the estuary, but the effects were most pronounced in the lower estuary compared to the upper estuary. Collectively, our results advance understanding of the in-fluence of extreme events on estuarine salinity regimes. Our analyses also highlight the value of the CSI for identifying periods with extreme salinities (i.e., extreme high or low salinities) via calculations that place salinity levels within and across estuaries within a historical context.

Signa-tures of river chemistry recovery from acid rain since the Clean Air Act and similar legislation have been reported ex-tensively in small streams but are often subdued or masked in large rivers by complex, co-occurring drivers. Here we assess the recovery of river chemistry from acid rain deposition in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the largest river basin in North America. We combine analysis of temporal trends of acid rain indicator solutes with Bayesian statistical models to assess the large-scale recovery from acid rain and characterize effects of anthropogenic activities. We found evidence of river chemistry recovery from acid rain; however, the effects of other anthropogenic activities, including fertilizer application and road salting, and changing climate, are likely intensifying. Trends of pH, alkalinity and SO4 export suggest acid rain recovery at large in the MRB, with stronger evidence of recovery in the historically afflicted eastern region of the basin. The concentrations of acid rain indicators generally correlate positively to NO3 and Cl, in-dicating that N-fertilizer application may have significantly increased weathering, and possibly acidification, and road salt application likely increased cation loss from catchments and contributed to SO4 export. Temperature correlates positively with solute concentrations, possibly through respiration-driven weathering or evaporation. The concentra-tions of acid rain indicators correlate negatively and most strongly to discharge, indicating discharge as a predominant driver and that lower discharge during droughts can elevate concentrations of riverine solutes in a changing climate. Using long-term data, this study represents a rare, comprehensive assessment of the recovery from acid rain in a large river basin, taking into consideration the entangled effects of multiple human activities and climate change. Our results highlight the ever-present need for adaptive environmental management in a constantly changing world.

However, little work has been carried out on the multiforcing-induced hydrological behavior of the Lower Mekong River -delta (LMR) over the past 100 years. Here, the secular variations in water discharge were analyzed for seven gauging stations along the main stream of the LMR from the 1920s-2019, to identify the riverine hydrological mechanisms under different dynamic conditions. The results show that the water discharge delivered by the LMR to the delta decreased on both 50-year and centennial scales. Meanwhile, the daily water discharge of the LMR-delta has become more evenly distributed intra-annually, leading to "no flood in the flood season, no drought in the dry season" in this reach. While regional rainfall dominates the long-term variations in the water discharge in the LMR, episodic tropical cyclones can induce a gradual increase with enlarged spatial divergences in water discharge from the mountainous region to the delta by bringing heavy rainfall. Moreover, although the operation of the mega dams in the Upper Mekong Basin has significantly influenced the distribution of the downstream water discharge in the dry season, minor impacts can also be found in the wet season. The water consumption for irrigation was increased from the upstream to the downstream basin, which may contribute to the severe reduction in the downstream water discharge, even though typhoons induced much more runoff along the downstream reach. Considering future climate change in Southeast Asia with potential upward trends in anthropogenic stressors, it can be expected that the water discharge of the LMR-delta could worsen, and urgent countermeasures that address water resource management should be strongly considered by decision-makers in the affected countries of the Mekong River-delta.

J	VishnuPriya, MS; Agilan, V				VishnuPriya, M.

Understanding climate change impacts on extreme precipitation is vital for sustainable infrastructure development and water resources management. There are different methods to downscale precipitation to local scale from the Global Climate Models' simulations available at coarse resolution. The change factor (CF) method is one of those widely used methods for downscaling extreme precipitation. However, there are many variations in the CF method, and no study is available reporting the best CF method for downscaling extreme precipitation until today. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate different variants of four change factor methods, namely Additive Constant Scaling (ACS), Additive Daily Scaling (ADS), Multiplicative Constant Scaling (MCS) and Multiplicative Daily Scaling (MDS), for simulating extreme precipitation over India. Further, the optimum size of the baseline period for all four change factor methods and the optimum number of change factors for the daily scaling method are also evaluated. A total of 80 variants of four change factor methods, namely ACS, ADS, MCS and MDS, are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method. Change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the Annual Maximum (AM) precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series extracted with Peaks Over Threshold (POT) method. The results indicate that the daily scaling methods (ADS and MDS) are the best change factor method for more than 75% (3713 out of 4948) of IMD grids for downscaling extreme precipitation. It is also observed that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35% (1708 out of 4948) of IMD grids for downscaling extreme precipitation. However, change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors (including constant scaling variants) are consistent compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors.

Despite its importance in the context of global change, little is known about the plant phenology of subtropical regions. In the Argentinean Wet Chaco region, which is currently under high pressure due to land-use intensification, the phenology patterns of its natural land covers are remarkably understudied. This important aspect of vegetation functioning can be effectively monitored through indices based on satellite imagery, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Thus, in this work, we used the NDVI from MODIS imagery to analyse plant phenology in the Argentinean Wet Chaco and discuss its implications in the current context of global change. NDVI time series were analysed for the period 2000-2018 for the following plant categories: riparian forest, forest islet, dense and open palm savanna and flooding grassland. Their seasonality and precipitation marginal response (PMR) were also assessed. The riparian forest presented the highest NDVI annual mean values and lowest PMR, followed by the forest islet. The flooding grassland presented the highest seasonality and palm savannas the highest precipitation dependence, with even higher PMR values in drier years. Climate change models predict an increase in precipitation in the region. If this occurs, palm savannas and flooding grasslands could present a more stable phenology. This would imply better conditions for cattle grazing and would, thus, reinforce the current land-use pressure. On the contrary, this increase in precipitation would not have an impact over the photosynthetic activity of both types of forest, since our results suggest that this parameter is not limited by rainfall. In the current context of climate change and land-use intensification, the results obtained provide key knowledge for a better use, management and conservation of the environments of the Argentinean Wet Chaco.

They suffer from the severe effects of increased frequencies and intensities of coastal hazards, particularly flooding, while oftentimes continuing to sprawl into hazard-exposed areas and grow beyond the pace of sufficient infrastructure development. Even though these problems have been quite well understood for a while, there is still comparatively little knowledge and scientific assessment of the solution space, i.e., on the options available for adaptation and the ways in which they are being perceived, framed and evaluated in the scientific literature. Focusing on Jakarta, this study presents findings from a systematic assessment of peer-reviewed scientific literature on the adaptation solution space with regard to current and future flooding. Jakarta is chosen as a case study since it is among the cities with the highest flood risk and adaptation pressure globally while also being one of the most heavily researched coastal cities in this regard, certainly in the Global South. Based on a structured keyword search, we assess 339 articles. Results indicate that the perceived solution space is skewed towards hard protection against flooding, while measures to accommodate flooding or retreat from exposed areas are less widely considered in the scientific debate. Soft adaptation measures for the reduction of social vulnerability receive less attention in the literature than those measures targeting the taming of flood hazards, often through engineering solutions. Likewise, hybrid adaptation approaches, which combine soft and hard measures in a complementary way, are only rarely considered. Looking into the future, the findings suggest that despite the importance of hard flood protection as a main adaptation solution in Jakarta, other fields of the solution space deserve increased scientific attention. This relates in particular to urgently needed feasibility and effectiveness assessments of ecosystems-based solutions for flood mitigation and adaptation options targeting social vulnerability. While the empirical results are specific to Jakarta, heuristic observations from research on other coastal cities suggest that similar scoping exercises of the predominantly perceived solution space might be of relevance in many cities beyond Jakarta.

J	Cheikh, MI; Momen, M				Cheikh, Mohamad Ibrahim; Momen, Mostafa			The interacting effects of storm surge intensification and sea-level rise on coastal resiliency: a high-resolution turbulence resolving case study	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						storm surge; sea-level rise; turbulent flows; large-eddy simulation; coastal resiliency; mitigation strategies	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE; MODEL; WAVES; INTENSITY; VELOCITY; IMPACTS; HAZARD; SCALE; BAY	Climate change and global warming will increase the risk of coastal floods and storm surges, which can highly jeopardize communities and infrastructures along shorelines. There are two main drivers for this increase: surge amplification, which is caused by the projected hurricane intensification, and global sea-level rise (SLR). Although both factors can simultaneously affect storm surges, current knowledge on their interacting effects on the resiliency of coastal infrastructure is limited. To address this knowledge gap, we investigate the impacts of multiple storm surge scenarios on vehicles and buildings by varying wave heights, periods, and sea levels under current mitigation strategies. These surges are highly turbulent due to their high speed and wave-wave/bathymetry interactions. Large-scale numerical simulations with low-resolution (similar to 1-5 km) and depth-integrated models that do not resolve turbulence cannot assess the thorough impacts of these storm surges on infrastructures accurately. Hence, we employ a high-resolution numerical approach that is capable of resolving turbulent eddies down to similar to 3 cm and capturing fluid-structure interactions. The distribution of hydrodynamic loads is found to vary nonlinearly in all directions with surge amplification and can significantly exceed calculations from classical theories that neglect turbulence. Two approaches from previous experiments are employed in a novel way to evaluate the resiliency of vehicles and infrastructure during storm surges. Our results indicate that vehicle mobility on the considered road will be imperiled by moderate surges (4 m wave height), and the elevated building will fail by surge intensification (8 m waves). We found that some storm-surge wave heights that are relatively safe now (e.g., 2 m waves for vehicles and 6 m for the building) will become hazardous in the future with an SLR. Therefore, road and building safety regulations should account for the interacting effects of hurricane intensification and SLR when devising mitigation strategies.

Hernandez			Extreme Rainfall Associated With Hurricane Maria Over Puerto Rico and Its Connections to Climate Variability and Change	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						hurricane; extreme; precipitation; Puerto Rico; climate; Maria	TROPICAL CYCLONES; HOT SPELLS; SEASON; OSCILLATION; FLOODS	Hurricane Maria was associated with record-breaking rainfall over Puerto Rico and caused unprecedented flooding and landslides. Here we analyze the extreme rainfall produced by Hurricane Maria using 35 stations with daily precipitation data from 1956-2016. A covariate-based extreme value analysis point process approach that accounts for natural climate variability and long-term climate change influences on extreme rainfall is applied. Hurricane Maria produced the single largest maximum rainfall event since 1956 and had the highest total averaged precipitation of 129 storms that have impacted the island since 1956. Return periods for an event of Hurricane Maria's precipitation magnitude decreased in 48.6% of stations across Puerto Rico and at least halved when averaged across the island. Within the most affected areas it is likely that the probability of precipitation of Maria's magnitude has increased by a factor greater than 1 (best estimate 4.85) as a result of long-term climate trends. Plain Language Summary Hurricane Maria was associated with record-breaking rainfall over Puerto Rico, which caused unprecedented flooding and landslides across the island and led to widespread devastation. Here we analyze the extreme rainfall produced by Hurricane Maria using 35 historical weather stations with daily precipitation data from 1956-2016. We use a statistical analysis technique to determine how unusual Maria's rainfall was and if Maria's rainfall can be attributed to climate variability and/or climate change. We find that Hurricane Maria produced the single largest maximum rainfall event since 1956 and had the highest precipitation of 129 storms that have impacted the island since 1956. Our study concludes that extreme precipitation, like that of Hurricane Maria, has become much more likely in recent years and long-term trends in atmospheric and sea surface temperature are both linked to increased precipitation in Puerto Rico. These results place Maria prominently in the context of extreme storms that have impacted Puerto Rico and indicate that such events are becoming increasingly likely.

Land Policy for Flood Risk Management-Toward a New Working Paradigm	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						flood risk management; land management; land policy; scale; process; governance	WATER MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT-WIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; INSTRUMENTS; STAKEHOLDER	Flood risk management (FRM) aims to integrate necessary technical measures with environmental and societal approaches. Focusing on the process and governance of how to plan, implement, and maintain solutions therefore becomes essential. Among the different stakeholders, landowners are a key group to be considered. This contribution elaborates on the interconnections between land policy, FRM and private land ownership. It is based on the European COST Action network LAND4FLOOD, which brings together academics and stakeholders from various disciplines and more than 35 countries. We argue for a less project oriented and more process oriented approach, a focus on land management and more emphasis on small-scale measures. This represents a break with some of the recent working paradigms of FRM.

Milan's run-flow irrigation system, and particularly its flagship water meadows, have been under great admiration by scholars from all over the world since the eighteenth century. Today the traditional irrigation system is in crisis and the water meadows are in sharp decline. Protection is entrusted by the regional parks around Milan, which implement passive to pro-active protection. Some scientific research and empirical evidence show that the combination of these ancient techniques can ensure minimum water quantity in case of drought and water absorption in case of excess rain. Their benefits could potentially expand to large areas, as was the previous meadows extension, and could also be profitable for sustainable peri-urban areas.

Community engagement is critical to getting BGI implementation 'right' and producing more sustainable solutions, yet understandings of approaches differ and remain difficult to harmonize or resolve. A review of the extant literature shows that many guidelines frame communities in the passive 'recipient' mode, and remain quiet about the power relations framing and conditioning engagement. The paper then proposes a set of generic template principles for the development of community engagement frameworks to facilitate and encourage greater community co-production of BGI, with the hope that this could then improve public preferences, accountability, efficacy and sustainability.

Landscape-Hydrological Changes in the Don Basin	WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						watershed; landscape structure; water balance; surface flow; groundwater flow; water-balance stations; climatic and anthropogenic changes	FOREST-STEPPE; RUNOFF	Present-day changes in the landscape structure of the Don Basin are analyzed. Data of water-balance stations are used to determine the contributions of various land types to the formation of spring surface flow. Estimates are given for the present-day anthropogenic and climatic changes in the surface flow and infiltration into soil in plowed lands during spring flood, as well as river flow and its surface and subsurface components. A characteristic formation feature of the annual water balance is shown to be a considerable decrease in the surface flow component along with an increase in its subsurface component. The identified trends in the current changes in the runoff from the Don watershed are stable and have to be taken into account in the forecasting of water resources for the nearest future.

The major incidences of heavy rainfall and the consequent urban flooding and their causes are briefly described. The recent flood disaster management and mitigation measures carried out by the Central, State and Local Government are highlighted. The flood resilience initiatives and challenges are then discussed. The effects of climate change on increased rainfall in shorter durations are now being felt in many Indian cities. The planners are now taking cognizance of this and future flood resilience measures are being planned to incorporate an integrated approach to stormwater management by recommending best management practices in the stormwater manuals. However, a lot still needs to be done to make the cities in India flood resilient. This article is part of the theme issue 'Urban flood resilience'.

Heatwaves, water stress, desertification, flooding, and sea level rise are environmental stressors that increase morbidity, mortality, and poor mental health in Sub-Saharan Africa. While most migration is intra-African, climate change is also affecting migration patterns outside the continent. To tackle the health challenges induced by these events, such as infectious diseases and malnutrition, health care providers in Sub-Saharan Africa and in receiving countries in Europe must adapt their systems to provide appropriate health services to these communities. While health systems differ greatly across the global north and south, adaptation measures are similar and should be integrated. We present recommendations for adaptation of health systems to climate-related migration, including strengthening health systems, providing access to healthcare, culturally-appropriate services, policy-oriented research and training, and inter-sectoral collaboration.

Here, we assessed the capability of a non-stationary framework for modeling seasonal precipitation series using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS), a well-established approach for modeling hydro-meteorological variables under non-stationary conditions. Seasonal precipitation series were considered from 95 stations covering the period of 1970-2021 across Turkey. Four widely used homogeneity tests showed that the seasonal precipitation series were generally reliable, with no obvious anthropogenic influences or errors. The parameters of the fitted distributions were modeled as a function of large-scale oscillation indices known to control precipitation across Turkey, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAOI), North Sea-Caspian Pattern (NCPI), Mediterranean Oscillation (MOI), and Southern Oscillation (SOI). The model with oscillation indices performed better at 85%, 79%, 76%, and 54% of sites for autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively, than the model with no covariates. In particular, the NCPI was seen as a significant predictor during the winter, while the MOI captured precipitation variability well across the country during autumn and summer. The NAOI appeared as another important predictor during all seasons except summer, while the SOI appeared as a significant explanatory variable in certain regions. Using the non-stationary models, we then computed seasonal precipitation estimates for different return periods (i.e., 20, 50, and 100 years) and considered the minimum and maximum possible extreme precipitation scenarios at each site. We show how the use of simple minimum/maximum values derived from the non-stationary models can help provide water resource managers and policy makers with a plausible range of extreme values, rather than the single deterministic value obtained from the traditional stationary approach.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Extreme event; Climate change; Alien species; Elodea nuttallii	GROWTH; PLANT; CLIMATE; BIOMASS	Plant invasion and extreme climate event are both important ecological issues under the background of global climate change. However, how these two incidents interact with each other is still debatable in different ecosystems. In this study we investigated the interaction between the extreme flooding event during the autumn of 2021 in the Han River and the invasion of Elodea nuttallii based on a long-term field survey from 2020 to 2023 and two indoor controlled experiments (propagule bank experiment and decomposition experiment). We hypothesized that two negatives (extreme flooding event and invasive submerged macrophytes) can make an affirmative (macrophyte community consisting of native species). The field survey found that the extreme flooding caused a critical change of transparency until seven months later the water quality turned into the initial condition, and the maximum biomass of E. nuttallii decreased significantly in 2022 after the flooding. Abundant propagule bank of native macrophytes in the sediment contributed to the strong resilience of macrophyte community responding to the extreme flooding; the maximum total biomass of macrophyte community in 2022 did not differ from that in the two years prior to the flooding. Additionally, more species of native macrophyte was found in the field survey after the extreme flooding. Decomposition rates of E. nuttallii fragments was large as 0.69 d-1, and long-time high turbidity lead to a very fast run-out of the only reproduction tissue (fragments) of this alien species in the river, which resulted in the slowing of its recovery. Inspired by this study, we further proposed a cost-effective methodology to control the invasive species E. nuttallii, i.e., the combination of propagule bank of native macrophytes in the sediment and artificially manipulated pulse flooding.

To effectively manage these floods and address this issue, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of return periods and hydroclimatic parameters (such as intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and related coefficients), which are essential for designing stormwater drainage structures. Determining return periods and these parameters requires statistical analysis of extreme events, and this analysis needs to be regularly updated in response to climate change. The objective of this study was to determine the necessary return periods and hydroclimatic parameters to improve stormwater drainage systems in the city and its surroundings areas. This required annual maximum precipitation series of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h for 20 years length (1999-2018) as well as flood record data. The intensity series, derived by dividing the amount of rainfall by its duration, was adjusted using Gumbel's law. IDF curves were constructed based on Montana and Talbot models, and their coefficients were determined according to the corresponding return periods. In 2010, which witnessed devastating floods in the country, the return period for the most intense rainfall events was 40 years, followed by 2013 with a return period of 13.4 years. Consequently, the commonly used 10-year return period for the design of stormwater drainage structures in Cotonou is insufficient. The Talbot model produced the lowest mean square errors for each quantile series and coefficients of determination closest to one, indicating that the parameters obtained from this model are well suited for designing hydraulic structures in Cotonou. The hydroclimatic parameters presented in this study will contribute to the improved design of hydraulic structures in the city of Cotonou.

Furthermore, the optimal level of risk mitigation policy should be determined by public preferences for risk reduction. However, it is difficult to reveal public preferences for coastal flood risk reduction because projections of coastal flood risks inevitably involve uncertainty. This study aims to estimate household preference for coastal flood reduction under ambiguity and multiple projections of coastal flood risks. By coupling storm surge inundation simulations and stated preference experiments with decision models, we estimate the expected loss reduction, risk premium, and ambiguity premium for coastal flood risk mitigation policies. The study shows that ignoring the ambiguity premium causes significant undervaluation of coastal flood risk mitigation. Plain Language Summary Climate change has contributed to more frequent and severe storm tide in coastal areas and enhanced flood risk. Thus, risk mitigation policies are essential to address increasing coastal flood risks from global warming. The policymakers must integrate multiple projections of coastal flood risk to make policy decisions. These decisions should reflect stakeholders' preferences on risk and ambiguity. Risk is uncertainty with a clear probability distribution, and ambiguity is uncertainty without a clear probability distribution. Currently, this key requirement has not yet been met. To fill this gap, this study investigates residents' preference to mitigate flood risk under ambiguity by coupling flood simulation and surveying residents on their willingness to pay for insurance to mitigate risk under average and worst-case scenarios. The ambiguity premium is an additional payment for an individual to reduce flood risk with an unknown probability distribution in comparison to flood risk specified with a well-known probability distribution. We found that ignoring ambiguity premium causes undervaluing coastal flood risk mitigation.

In the current study, primary data was used to analyze the situation. A semi-structured questionnaire was distributed among farmers. We have collected a cross-sectional dataset and applied the PLS-SEM dual-stage hybrid model to test the proposed hypotheses and rank the social, economic, and technological factors according to their normalized importance. Results revealed that farmers' knowledge associated with adaption strategies, food security, risk assessment, and livelihood assets are the most significant predictors. Farmers need to have sufficient knowledge about floods, and it can help them to adopt proper measurements. A PLS-SEM dual-stage hybrid model was used to check the relationship among all variables, which showed a significant relationship among DV, IV, and control variables. PLS-SEM direct path analysis revealed that AS (b = 0.155; p 0.001), FS (b = 0.343; p 0.001), LA (b = 0.273; p 0.001), RA (b = 0.147; p 0.006), and for FKF have statistically significant values of beta, while SD (b = 0.079NS) is not significant. These results offer support to hypotheses H1 through H4 and H5 being rejected. On the other hand, age does not have any relationship with farmers' knowledge of floods. Our study results have important policy suggestions for governments and other stakeholders to consider in order to make useful policies for the ecosystem. The study will aid in the implementation of effective monitoring and public policies to promote integrated and sustainable development, as well as how to minimize the impacts of floods on farmers' lives and save the ecosystem and food.

This possibility contains some main statistical characteristics of future floods. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to extract such statistical characteristics of the future flood series. Moreover, the initial values of the model were assumed to obey the probability distribution derived from historical floods. Hence, a novel full-series ARIMA stochastic model which can simultaneously reflect the statistical characteristics of past and future floods has been built to simulate the possible future extreme floods. Synthetic flood series under different future climate scenarios were randomly generated by the proposed model. Then the flood risks exceeding the design flood and check flood can be obtained. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was used to weight the flood risks projected by each GCM to better incorporate the uncertainty of GCMs. The Yangfanggou Reservoir in Yalong River basin of China was selected as a case study. The future flood risks under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were assessed. The results highlight that future flood risks have an increasing trend. Under future RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the risk rates of exceeding design flood are in the range of 0.63%-0.74%, 1.31%-4.58% and 2.63%-5.23%, respectively. The risk rates of exceeding check flood are in the range of 0.20%-0.25%, 0.41%-2.14% and 0.97%-2.48%, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk and could be useful when planning to fortify existing structures and update design standards.

Taking the Liaohe Delta as an example, the SLAMM (Sea Level Rise Affecting Marsh Model) was used to simulate the medium-term (2010-2050) and the long-term (2010-2100) of the spatiotemporal changes of land use in the four scenarios (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 m) of sea level rise by 2100 and then based on the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Model) to assess and compare the impact of SLR on ecosystem services. The results are as follows. (1) The difference in SLR height greatly influences the transformation of the coastal wetland pattern. In 2100, the core construction land would be affected on a large scale for landward salt marsh migration for 1.5 and 2 m SLR scenarios. (2) Due to inundation, erosion, and vegetation succession, the mean total carbon storage for the four scenarios will decrease by about 0.58 x 10(6) t. The habitat quality is relatively stable, and its value is about 0.7. The nitrogen and phosphorus loads will be reduced by 26.27% and 28.22%, respectively. The region spatial distribution of freshwater marshes will shrink, while the transformation of salt marshes is inconsistent. The large-scale formation of regularly flooded marshes can also provide high levels of ecosystem services as salt marshes. In conclusion, the coastal wetlands show two evolution patterns under the four sea level rise scenarios, the two low ones show a slow change, and the two high ones are large. Quantitative assessment of the effects, scope and intensity of the impact of SLR on the function of ecosystem services in the coastal wetlands can provide reference and indicative significance for wetland development, construction, ecological conservation, and restoration in similar coastal areas under the impact of climate change.

On the other hand, climate variability has caused water scarcity in many countries in recent years. Therefore, it is extremely important to analyze future changes of precipitation data in countries facing climate change. In this study, the Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) method was applied for precipitation trend detection at seven stations located in the Wadi Sly basin, in Algeria, during a 50-year period (1968-2018). In particular, the IPTA method was applied separately for both arithmetic mean and standard deviation. Additionally, results from the IPTA method were compared to the results of trend analysis based on the Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator. For the different stations, the first results showed that there is no regular polygon in the IPTA graphics, thus indicating that precipitation data varies by years. As an example, IPTA result plots of both the arithmetic mean and standard deviation data for the Saadia station consist of many polygons. This result means that the monthly total precipitation data is not constant and the data is unstable. In any case, the application of the IPTA method showed different trend behaviors, with a precipitation increase in some stations and decrease in others. This increasing and decreasing variability emerges from climate change. IPTA results point to a greater focus on flood risk management in severe seasons and drought risk management in transitional seasons across the Wadi Sly basin. When comparing the results of trend analysis from the IPTA method and the rest of the analyzed tests, good agreement was shown between all methods. This shows that the IPTA method can be used for preliminary analysis trends of monthly precipitation.

Such events can impact species survival and species interactions. One of the most ubiquitous symbioses on earth is the nutrient exchange partnership between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and their host plants. While past work has shown that mycorrhizal fungi can help alleviate stress, it is unknown how phosphorus uptake by plants to fungi is affected by extreme weather events, such as flooding and heat waves. To test this response, we grew Medicago truncatula host plants with or without mycorrhizal fungi and then exposed them to extreme weather treatments: increasing soil temperature by 12 degrees C, or by flooding the plant roots for 7 days. We measured plant and fungal performance, and quantified phosphorus (P) uptake before and after extreme weather treatments using a technique in which we tagged apatite, a form of rock phosphorus, with fluorescing quantum-dots (QDs) nanoparticles. We then measured fluorescence in root and shoot tissue at harvest. We found that plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were affected by soil flooding, with plant survival, fungal colonization and QD-apatite uptake decreasing under flooded conditions. We did not see these negative effects in the heat treatment. While the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi affected plant biomass allocation, leading to an increase in shoot biomass, the symbiosis did not increase plant survival, total biomass or QD uptake in either treatment. More generally, we found host tissue contained roughly 80% more QD-apatite from the pre-treatment compared to the post-treatment nutrient injection. Future studies should focus on various plant-fungal combinations to create databases on which predictive models to extreme weather events can be constructed.

The western region of the Gangatic plain is worst affected due to river bank erosion, frequent floods and climate change. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the livelihood vulnerability of the communities of riparian region of Manikchak block of the Gangatic plain by classifying the region into three zones based on the distance from the river. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) was applied by selecting suitable social and biophysical indicators through inductive and deductive approaches. The data for the estimation of LVI was collected by randomly selecting a total of 240 households from the villages of the three zones. The spatial modeling of LVI was achieved by applying spatial cluster and outlier analysis using local Moran's I Index and by hotspot analysis using Getis-OrgG" statistics. Differential vulnerabilities across the three zones was observed with nearer to river zone was highly vulnerable. The villages nearer to river was more vulnerable due to greater exposure to river bank erosion and flood; higher sensitivity to insufficient access to basic amenities and poor adaptive capacity due to low socioeconomic status and poor livelihood security. Moreover, the spatial pattern of hotspot was also identified as high vulnerable, high-low vulnerable and low vulnerable areas in the region. The results signified that the social and biophysical parameters were the main contributors for the differential vulnerabilities in the region. Therefore, the study concludes that the vulnerability of the communities varies with respect to their location to river and the differential approaches based on the social attributes of the communities and spatial characteristics of the location may be useful for addressing the livelihood vulnerability of the communities residing along the bank of the river.

Evaluation of the Climate Extremes Index over the United States using 20th and mid-21st century North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate extremes; extreme events; indices; NARCCAP	DROUGHT SEVERITY INDEX; HEALTH IMPACTS; HEAT WAVES; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; US; PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; PROJECTIONS; MORTALITY; WEATHER	Much of our current risk assessment, especially for extreme events and natural disasters, comes from the assumption that the likelihood of future extreme events can be predicted based on the past. However, as global temperatures rise, established climate ranges may no longer be applicable, as historic records for extremes such as heat waves and floods may no longer accurately predict the changing future climate. To assess extremes (present-day and future) over the contiguous United States, we used NOAA's Climate Extremes Index (CEI), which evaluates extremes in maximum and minimum temperature, extreme one-day precipitation, days without precipitation, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The CEI is a spatially sensitive index that uses percentile-based thresholds rather than absolute values to determine climate "extremeness" and is thus well-suited to compare extreme climate across regions. We used regional climate model data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to compare a late 20th century reference period to a mid-21st century "business as usual" (SRES A2) greenhouse gas-forcing scenario. Results show a universal increase in extreme hot temperatures across all models, with annual average maximum and minimum temperatures exceeding 90th percentile thresholds consistently across the continental United States. Results for precipitation indicators have greater spatial variability from model to model, but indicate an overall movement towards less frequent but more extreme precipitation days in the future. Due to this difference in response between temperature and precipitation, the mid-21st century CEI is primarily an index of temperature extremes, with 90th percentile temperatures contributing disproportionately to the overall increase in climate extremeness. We also examine the efficacy of the PDSI in this context in comparison to other drought indices.

Abiotic stresses such as temperature (cold, heat), water (drought, flooding), irradiance, salinity, nutrients, and heavy metals can strongly affect plant growth dynamics and the yield and quality of horticultural products. Such effects have become of greater importance during the course of global climate change. Different strategies and techniques can be used to detect, investigate, and mitigate the effects of environmental and nutritional stress. Horticultural crop management is moving towards digitized, precision management through wireless remote-control solutions, but data analysis, although a traditional approach, remains the basis of stress detection and crop management. This Special Issue summarizes the recent progress in agronomic management strategies to detect and reduce environmental and nutritional stress effects on the yield and quality of horticultural crops.

In particular for the lower floodplain region, compared with the baseline condition without SLR, the increment in the storm surge height under the SLR condition can be twice the SLR rate as a result of nonlinear amplification. This result highlights the necessity for designing more robust coastal infrastructure to mitigate the effect of storm surge in the context of SLR.

However, the complex hydrogeological attributes of these systems, linked to extremely fast aquifer recharge processes and flow through well-connected conduit networks, often present difficulty in predicting how they will respond to changing climatological conditions. This study investigates the predicted impacts of climate change on a lowland karst catchment by using a semi-distributed pipe network model of the karst aquifer populated with output from the high spatial resolution (4 km) Consortium for Small-scale Modelling Climate Lokalmodell (COSMO-CLM) regional climate model simulations for Ireland. An ensemble of projections for the future Irish climate were generated by downscaling from five different global climate models (GCMs), each based on four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) to account for the uncertainty in the estimation of future global emissions of greenhouse gases. The onedimensional hydraulic/hydrologic karst model incorporates urban drainage software to simulate open channel and pressurised flow within the conduits, with flooding on the land surface represented by storage nodes with the same stage volume properties of the physical turlough basins. The lowland karst limestone catchment is located on the west coast of Ireland and is characterised by a well-developed conduit-dominated karst aquifer which discharges to the sea via intertidal and submarine springs. Annual above ground flooding associated with this complex karst system has led to the development of unique wetland ecosystems in the form of ephemeral lakes known as turloughs; however, extreme flooding of these features causes widespread damage and disruption in the catchment. This analysis has shown that mean, 95th and 99th percentile flood levels are expected to increase by significant proportions for all future emission scenarios. The frequency of events currently considered to be extreme is predicted to increase, indicating that more significant groundwater flooding events seem likely to become far more common. The depth and duration of flooding is of extreme importance, both from an ecological perspective in terms of wetland species distribution and for extreme flooding in terms of the disruption to homes, transport links and agricultural land inundated by flood waters. The seasonality of annual flooding is also predicted to shift later in the flooding season, which could have consequences in terms of ecology and land use in the catchment. The investigation of increasing mean sea levels, however, showed that anticipated rises would have very little impact on groundwater flooding due to the marginal impact on ebb tide outflow volumes. Overall, this study highlights the relative vulnerability of lowland karst systems to future changing climate conditions, mainly due to the extremely fast recharge which can occur in such systems. The study presents a novel and highly effective methodology for studying the impact of climate change in lowland karst systems by coupling karst hydrogeological models with the output from high-resolution climate simulations.

Accurately and quantitatively decomposing the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in large basins with significant spatial heterogeneity remains a challenge. In this paper, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm was used to identify the regional differences in hydrological processes of the Yangtze River Basin (YZRB) based on multiple factors. Then, regional Budyko equations with synthetic parameters were constructed for runoff decomposition using the hierarchical Bayesian model, considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins. Results showed that 44 subbasins in the YZRB can be clustered into five clusters based on 10 factors including precipitation, temperature, precipi-tation seasonality, vegetation coverage, saturated hydraulic conductivity, elevation, slope, topographic wetness index, irrigation water consumption, and proportion of built-up area per unit area. From Cluster 1 to 5, P, T, IRR, and B decreased from about 1400 mm, 17 degrees C, 57.9 mm, and 1.59 % to about 870 mm, 12 degrees C, 15.6 mm, and 0.40 %, respectively, while ELEV and SLP increased from about 300 m and 3 degrees to about 3500 m and 10 degrees, respectively. Hierarchical Bayesian models can improve the performance of Budyko equations by better-simulating n, compared with linear regression models. Their R2, RB, and RMSE for the whole YZRB were as follows: 0.9104 versus 0.7591, 4.33 % versus 8.21 %, and 0.06 versus 0.11, respectively. Runoff decomposition from 1982 to 2018 showed that precipitation led to more than 34 % change in runoff in Cluster 2, while the influence of potential evapotranspiration on runoff changes was less than 3.00 % in each cluster. Rising temperature caused runoff to decrease by more than 7.90 % in Cluster 1, 3, and 4. In addition, precipitation seasonality, vegetation, and irrigation water consumption had different influences in different clusters. This study improves the ability of the Budyko equation to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on regional runoff changes and provides more reasonable suggestions for water resource management.

The European Forest Condition Monitor: Using Remotely Sensed Forest Greenness to Identify Hot Spots of Forest Decline	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						MODIS NDVI; drought; late frost; phenology; water stress; ice storm; windthrow	DROUGHT TOLERANCE; VEGETATION INDEX; NORWAY SPRUCE; SPRING FROST; GROWTH; IMPACT; TREES; HEAT; FLUORESCENCE; ECOSYSTEMS	Forest decline, in course of climate change, has become a frequently observed phenomenon. Much of the observed decline has been associated with an increasing frequency of climate change induced hotter droughts while decline induced by flooding, late-frost, and storms also play an important role. As a consequence, tree mortality rates have increased across the globe. Despite numerous studies that have assessed forest decline and predisposing factors for tree mortality, we still lack an in-depth understanding of (I) underlying eco-physiological mechanisms, (II) the influence of varying environmental conditions related to soil, competition, and micro-climate, and (III) species-specific strategies to cope with prolonged environmental stress. To deepen our knowledge within this context, studying tree performance within larger networks seems a promising research avenue. Ideally such networks are already established during the actual period of environmental stress. One approach for identifying stressed forests suitable for such monitoring networks is to assess measures related to tree vitality in near real-time across large regions by means of satellite-borne remote sensing. Within this context, we introduce the European Forest Condition monitor (EFCM)-a remote-sensing based, freely available, interactive web information tool. The EFCM depicts forest greenness (as approximated using NDVI from MODIS at a spatial resolution of roughly 5.3 hectares) for the pixel-specific growing season across Europe and consequently allows for guiding research within the context of concurrent forest performance. To allow for inter-temporal comparability and account for pixel-specific features, all observations are set in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) records over the monitoring period beginning in 2001. The EFCM provides both a quantile-based and a proportion-based product, thereby allowing for both relative and absolute comparison of forest greenness over the observational record. Based on six specific examples related to spring phenology, drought, late-frost, tree die-back on water-logged soils, an ice storm, and windthrow we exemplify how the EFCM may help identifying hotspots of extraordinary forest greenness. We discuss advantages and limitations when monitoring forest condition at large scales on the basis of moderate resolution remote sensing products to guide users toward an appropriate interpretation.

Sustaining United States reservoir storage capacity: Need for a new paradigm	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Reservoir sedimentation; Sustainable management	SEDIMENT DISCHARGE; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; CALIFORNIA; BENEFITS; DAMS	Although the hydrologic cycle is a continuously renewable resource, the natural rate of water delivery is highly variable. Water is made available to our society on a consistent and reliable basis largely due to flow regulation by storage reservoirs. However, under current management, the reservoir storage capacity needed for flow regulation is a non-renewable resource because this capacity is steadily being lost to sedimentation. Today's reservoirs occupy unique sites and may be considered largely irreplaceable, making the nation dependent on a non-sustainable resource. Sedimentation is steadily depleting storage capacity and progressively degrading the ability of reservoirs to fulfill their designated purposes. Sedimentation is also causing environmental impacts upstream and downstream of reservoirs. In the United States, the combined impacts of sedimentation and population growth have resulted in an estimated 35% decline in storage capacity per capita since this value peaked around 1970. In absolute terms, the estimated total reservoir storage capacity in the U.S. has dropped from a peak of 850 Gm(3) in the late 1980s to 810 Gm(3) today. Yet, sustaining the nation's long-term reservoir storage capacity has not been a priority for many public or private dam owners, especially when they lack a reservoir sedimentation monitoring policy. In many regions, future reservoir storage will have to serve an important role in the mitigation of climate change to help ensure water, food, and energy, and the reduction of flood risk. There is an imperative need to preserve existing reservoir storage capacity due to rising demands associated with population growth, and increasing hydrologic variability associated with climate change, and the challenges and costs associated with either expanding existing capacity or decommissioning and developing new storage capacity. The trapping of sediment behind dams has also contributed to the decline of freshwater and coastal environments downstream of dams. Reversing these dangerous trends in storage capacity and environmental integrity will require increased monitoring of reservoirs, application of both established and emerging sediment management technologies, and a new paradigm for sustainable reservoir design and management. It requires moving from the traditional design life (reservoir life expectancy) approach to the adoption of sustainable use as the appropriate criteria for reservoir design and operation, achieving a sediment balance across reservoirs to permit the indefinite operation of this critical infrastructure.

GEOCHIMICA; STABLE-ISOTOPE; STRONTIUM ISOTOPE; SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY; PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE; PALUSTRINE CARBONATES; LACUSTRINE CARBONATES	The identification and distinction of fluvial from lacustrine deposits and the recognition of catchment changes are crucial for the reconstruction of climate changes in terrestrial environments. The investigated drill core succession shows a general evolution from red-brown claystones to white-grey marlstones and microcrystalline limestones, which all have previously been considered as relict deposits of an impact ejecta-dammed lake, falling within the mid-Miocene Climate Transition. However, recent mammal biostratigraphic dating suggests a likely pre-impact age. Indeed, no pebbles from impact ejecta have been detected; only local clasts of Mesozoic formations, in addition to rare Palaeozoic lydites from outside of the study area. Lithofacies analysis demonstrates only the absence of lacustrine criteria, except for one charophyte-bearing mudstone. Instead, the succession is characterized by less diagnostic floodplain fines with palaeosols, palustrine limestones with root voids and intercalated thin sandstone beds. Carbonate isotope signatures of the mottled marlstones, palustrine limestones and mud-supported conglomerates substantiate the interpretation of a fluvial setting. Low, invariant delta O-18(carb) reflects a short water residence time and highly variable delta C-13(carb) indicates a variable degree of pedogenesis. Carbonate Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the entire succession show a unidirectional trend from 0.7103 to 0.7112, indicating a change of the solute provenance from Triassic to Jurassic rocks, identical to the provenance trend from extraclasts. The increase in carbonate along the succession is therefore independent from climate changes but reflects a base-level rise from the level of the siliciclastic Upper Triassic to the carbonate-bearing Lower to Middle Jurassic bedrocks. This study demonstrates that, when information on sedimentary architecture is limited, a combination of facies criteria (i.e. presence or absence of specific sedimentary structures and diagnostic organisms), component provenance, and stable and radiogenic isotopes is required to unequivocally distinguish between lacustrine and fluvial sediments, and to disentangle regional geological effects in the catchment and climate influences.

Here, we studied the fate of nitrate (NO3-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the microbial characteristics at different sediment depths in response to water levels (i.e., 5 or 2.5 cm) above the sediment surface and in the presence or absence of plants (Phragmites communis Trin) for four months in three wetland mesocosms. Results showed that mesocosm A (MA) with a high water level (5 cm above the surface) and plants had significantly higher DOC concentrations (17.57 +/- 8.22 mg/L) in sediment that were actively consumed by microorganisms than other mesocosms with low water level (MB) and without plant (MC) (8.77 +/- 2.38 mg/L and 7.87 +/- 2.72 mg/L in MB and MC, respectively). Consequently, the most of influent NO3- (20 mg-N/L) dramatically reduced in the vicinity of plant roots (-20 to -15 cm sediment depth) where active denitrification was expected in MA. Moreover, the functional genes involved in denitrification such as narG (2.4 x 10(8) -3.5 x 10(8) copies.g(-1)) and nirS (5.6 x 10(6)-1.1 x 10(7) copies.g(-1)) were more abundant in this mesocosm. The profile of the microbial community structure at the class level revealed that Alphaproteocbacteria (MA: 14.19 +/- 1.19%; MB: 14.01 +/- 0.51%; MC: 15.21 +/- 2.76%) and Actinobacteria (MA: 8.21 +/- 1.91%; MB: 13.91 +/- 2.13%; MC: 11.75 +/- 3.43%) were predominant in all three mesocosms. Interestingly, the clustered heatmap supported the obvious difference in microbial composition of MA from other mesocosms showing relatively more abundant Clostridia (6.71 +/- 1.54%) and Deltaproteobacteria (7.05 +/- 0.68%). These results can provide an insight to understand the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle associated with climate change in wetland systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Severe Continental-Scale Impacts of Climate Change Are Happening Now: Extreme Climate Events Impact Marine Habitat Forming Communities Along 45% of Australia's Coast	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						extreme climate events; kelp; coral; seagrass; mangrove; marine heat wave; modeling; ecosystem	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; KELP FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; HORIZON OIL-SPILL; RANGE SHIFTS; GLOBAL VALUE; CORAL-REEFS; RESPONSES; HEAT; TERRESTRIAL; TEMPERATURE	Recent increases in the frequency of extreme climate events (ECEs) such as heatwaves and floods have been attributed to climate change, and could have pronounced ecosystem and evolutionary impacts because they provide little opportunity for organisms to acclimate or adapt. Here we synthesize information on a series of ECEs in Australia from 2011 to 2017 that led to well-documented, abrupt, and extensive mortality of key marine habitat-forming organisms - corals, kelps, seagrasses, and mangroves - along >45% of the continental coastline of Australia. Coral bleaching occurred across much of northern Australia due to marine heatwaves (MHWs) affecting different regions in 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2017, while seagrass was impacted by anomalously high rainfall events in 2011 on both east and west tropical coasts. A MHW off western Australia (WA) during the 2011 La Nina extended into temperate and subtropical regions, causing widespread mortality of kelp forests and seagrass communities at their northern distribution limits. Mangrove forests experienced high mortality during the 2016 El Nino across coastal areas of northern and north-WA due to severe water stress driven by drought and anomalously low mean sea levels. This series of ECEs reflects a variety of different events - MHWs, intense rainfall from tropical storms, and drought. Their repeated occurrence and wide extent are consistent with projections of increased frequency and intensity of ECEs and have broad implications elsewhere because similar trends are predicted globally. The unprecedented and widespread nature of these ECE impacts has likely produced substantial ecosystem-wide repercussions. Predictions from ecosystem models suggest that the widespread mortality of habitat-forming taxa will have long-term and in some cases irreversible consequences, especially if they continue to become more frequent or severe. The abrupt ecological changes that are caused by ECEs could have greater long-term impacts than slower warming that leads to gradual reorganization and possible evolution and adaptation. ECEs are an emerging threat to marine ecosystems, and will require better seasonal prediction and mitigation strategies.	[Babcock, Russell C.; Bustamante, Rodrigo H.; Haywood, Michael D.

The paper explores arid compares the formal-legal as well as the perceived roles and responsibilities of key actor groups in the context of adaptation to urban pluvial flooding in the Dutch city Arnhem. The concluding section questions the assumed power of formal-legal rules and institutions in motivating key stakeholders to take action. It poses that, in order to stimulate participation and collaboration in local climate adaptation, more attention should be paid to the informal institutional context, in particular to the perception of responsibilities.

Evaluating the impact of different spatial linkages on forum outcome interdependencies in polycentric systems	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW			English	Article							COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; URBAN SUSTAINABILITY; ACTOR PERFORMANCE; NETWORK STRUCTURE; ACTION SITUATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; ECOLOGY; MANAGEMENT	In complex polycentric systems, decisions regarding the governance of certain subsystems (e.g., watersheds) are often determined by networks of diverse actors who participate across a range of forums tackling interconnected collective actions issues (e.g., water quality, biodiversity, flood management). Compounding this structural complexity are the multifaceted interdependencies that exist between forums across a system. Drawing on the Ecology of Games Theory (EGT), this article investigates the impact of different types of network linkages on outcome interdependence between forums. Using a series of spatial autoregressive models on data collected in a Tampa Bay water governance system, I find evidence that co-membership and organizational networks serve as pathways for outcome spillovers between forums. Building theory that helps elucidate how different types of network relationships may influence outcomes across a system is critical for the continued development of EGT and the governance of polycentric systems.

Qualitative data for the study were gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 25 local Black women from Inanda, Ntuzuma, KwaMashu and Umlazi. Five key informants from the eThekwini (Durban) metropolitan municipality were also interviewed. Findings from the study showed that although there is improved economic development in the selected settlements, which constitute informal settlements designated for Black South Africans during the apartheid era, such an economic development approach has not significantly improved the livelihoods and adaptive capacity of the local women. The article suggests a multidimensional approach to development that is practical, inclusive and equitable, and addresses local women's challenges associated with climate adaptation and sustainable livelihoods.

This paper assesses the environmental impact of sand extraction and the problems associated with its illegal exploitation. The analysis indicates that extracting sand at a greater rate than that at which it is naturally replenished has adverse consequences for fauna and flora. Further, illicit mining activities compound environmental damages and result in conflict, the loss of taxes/royalties, illegal work, and losses in the tourism industry. As sea-level rise associated with climate change threatens coastal areas, sand in coastal areas will play an increasingly greater role in determining the amount of damage from floods and erosion. The present analysis points to the need for swift action to regulate sand mining, monitoring, law enforcement, and international cooperation.

The training database was produced from simulations of a nonhydrostatic wave model calibrated using a subset of experimental overtopping data and covered a wide range of hydrological conditions, reef morphologies, and seawall heights. The ANN configuration was optimized through sensitivity analysis and overfitting was prevented using thek-fold cross-validation technique. The generalization ability of the ANN tool was tested against the remaining subset of the experimental data. The ANN tool provided reliable predictions using deep water wave parameters as input rather than parameters for waves at the toes of structures. This made it a practical predictor for use in the preliminary design of vertical seawalls and real time forecasting of wave-induced flooding in coral reef environments.

To better constrain these changes and their impacts on the Fennoscandian subarctic, we investigated molecular and inorganic proxies as well as plant wax D/H isotopes (D-C28) in a Holocene sedimentary record from Lake Tornetrask (Sweden). These data indicate a thermal maximum c. 8100 to 6300cal. a BP with reduced soil organic matter input, followed by a long-term cooling trend with increasing soil erosion. D data suggest a stable atmospheric circulation with predominance of westerly flow and North Atlantic moisture sourcing during the Early and Middle Holocene. Asubstantial depletion in D followed by increased flood frequency starting at c. 5300cal. a BP and intensifying c. 1500cal. a BP suggests a reorganization of the atmospheric circulation from zonal towards meridional flow with predominantly Arctic Ocean and Baltic Sea moisture sourcing.

Humid and semi-humid areas suffer from frequent flood events, whereas semi-arid areas suffer from flash floods because of urbanization and climate change, which contribute to an increase in runoff. This study applied -Support Vector Machine (epsilon-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the simulation and forecasting streamflow of three different catchments. The Evolutionary Strategy (ES) optimization method was used to optimize the ANN and SVM sensitive parameters. The relative performance of the two models was compared, and the results indicate that both models performed well for humid and semi-humid systems, and SVM generally perform better than ANN in the streamflow simulation of all catchments.

The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau features the most active crustal dynamics on earth, the strongest coupling effects of endogenic and exogenic dynamics, and the environment most sensitive to global climate change. The project area is characterized by extremely cold climate, high elevation and relief, high seismic in-tensity, high geothermal activity, and high tectonic stress. Consequently, the threat of various disaster risks is ever-present at different stages of the entire life cycle of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. There is urgent need to systematically study these problems at various levels from the fundamental science to the development of key technologies. This article investigates the different disaster risks recognized during the various stages of con-struction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway project, and summarizes the scientific challenges and technical problems faced in relation to disaster risk prevention and control. This work also introduces the scientific deployment and relevant research progress of the Sichuan-Tibet Fund special project initiated by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Here, we also aim to solve the major fundamental scientific challenges in terms of long-term risk prevention and control during the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, and lay a theoretical foundation to promote breakthroughs in the bottleneck of key technologies. The scientific challenges addressed in the study of disaster risk associated with the Sichuan-Tibet Railway include the following: The quantitative assessment of the activity of deep-large faults and strong earthquake prediction, the evolution of physical fields in areas of strong tectonic activity, the development mechanisms of tunnel hazards, the slope evolution processes under coupled endogenic and exogenic dynamics in alpine gorges, the impact of climate change on the formation and evolution of surface hazards, and the evolution of extreme wind fields in deep-cut canyons. The technical problems faced in disaster risk prevention and mitigation in relation to the Sichuan-Tibet Railway are as follows: Advanced identification, monitoring, and early warning of geological disasters in mountainous areas with steep and complex terrain; risk analysis, prevention, and control of railway engineering disasters based on their dy-namic processes; tunnel engineering hazard monitoring, early warning, risk analysis, prevention, and control technologies; key technologies for emergency response; and the green and resilient railway system and lifecycle risk management. The Sichuan-Tibet Fund special project will include five key research topics: (1) the interior geological structure and dynamic evolution of the eastern plateau; (2) the hazard-inducing mechanisms of coupled internal and external forces in canyons and gullies within plateaus; (3) the cataclysm mechanics of deeply buried long-distance tunnel engineering; (4) risk identification and projection of major disasters affecting the railway; and (5) the integrated management of scientific innovations and super large-scale railway con-struction. Systematic research is expected to reveal the evolution of earth surface movements and coupled engineering-disturbance related disasters. It will also enable the formation of a comprehensive risk analysis method for major engineering disasters, and promote the development of green, safe, efficient, and resilient engineering disaster risk reduction technologies that will support the disaster risk management during the entire lifecycle of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway.

J	Carvalho, P; Spataru, C				Carvalho, Priscila; Spataru, Catalina			Gaps in the governance of floods, droughts, and heatwaves in the United Kingdom	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Review						climate adaptation; equitable resilience; governance; risk reduction; sdgs; sendai framework	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and equitable resilience have cross-cutting challenges relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sendai Framework (SF) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). The capacity of governments to assess, prevent, prepare, respond, and recover from disasters depends on effective laws, planning, policies, governance instruments, equity indicators, harmonized standards, and a holistic approach to cross-sectoral issues and multi-scalar challenges. The principle of subsidiarity guides the United Kingdom (UK) approach to disaster governance, with decisions taken at lowest level and coordinated at different scales (national, sub-national, local). Cross-scale work needed to address large-scale issues and enable the pooling of resources, happens at a sub-national tier created especially for this purpose. At national level, there is a government lead department for each risk identified in the National Risk Assessment, with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) serving as the lead for floods and droughts, while the Department of Health and Social Care is the lead for heatwaves. In this paper we present the current state of the art of the governance of floods, droughts, and heatwaves in the UK, with a focus on pre-emergency phases and the shortage of indicators for assessment of the effectiveness of adaptation for all three disasters, which also compromise the realization and monitoring of targets across all three agendas. The governance of floods counts with the most developed legal framework of the three. Droughts are mainly dealt by the water sector, while heatwaves are treated exclusively as a health issue, leaving gaps with regards to the multiple risks these disasters pose to livelihoods and other sectors. Gaps and challenges that remain are related to siloed institutional approaches, lack of adaptation indicators, lack of cross-sectoral resilience standards, and lack of policy instruments and metrics to promote equitable resilience. Commonly, actions have mainly focused on the response and recovery strategies instead of risk reduction and adaptation to address rising vulnerabilities and exposure.

Drought risk assessment plays an important role in the Mun River Basin's agricultural sustainable development. The objective of this study was to identify the tempo-spatial variation in dryness and wetness patterns; the drought intensity, frequency, and duration; and the potential causes behind drought using the methods of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), correlation analysis, and the Pettitt test over the basin. Results showed that the Mun River Basin underwent a drying climate pattern, which is explained by the significant decreasing trend of SPEI_12M during the study period. In addition, the downstream area of the Mun River Basin was subjected to more intense, extreme dryness and wetness events as the decreased amplitude of SPEI_12M and SPEI_3M was higher than that over the upper and middle reaches. Drought intensity presented a remarkable decadal variation over the past 36 years, and an average 7% increase per decade in the drought intensity was detected. Besides, there have been more mild and moderate droughts frequently appearing over the Mun River Basin in recent decades. For the underlying causes behind the drought condition, on the one hand, the shortened precipitation day over the rainy season accounted more for the intense drought events than the precipitation amount. On the other hand, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-brought sea surface temperature anomalies aggravated the potential evapotranspiration (ETr), which might be closely related to the drought intensity and frequency variation. These tempo-spatial maps of dryness and wetness and drought occurrence characteristics can be conducive to local stakeholders and agricultural operators to better understand the agriculture industry risks and vulnerabilities and properly cope with pre-disaster planning and preparedness and post-disaster reconstruction over the Mun River Basin.

The present study is focused on the recent flood disaster in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin, which mainly affected the regions of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam in India and neighboring Bangladesh during July, August, and September 2020. Using the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, the flood extent was derived in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The composite area under flood inundation for July-September was estimated to be 25,889.1 km(2) for Bangladesh, followed by Bihar (20,837 km(2)), West Bengal (17,307.1 km(2)), and Assam (13,460.1 km(2)). The Copernicus Global Land Cover dataset was used to extract the affected agricultural area and flood-affected settlement. Floods have caused adverse impacts on agricultural lands and settlements, affecting 23.68-28.47% and 5.66-9.15% of these areas, respectively. The Gridded Population of the World (GPW) population density and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) population dataset were also employed to evaluate flood impacts, which revealed that 23.29 million of the population was affected by floods in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin. The highest impacts of floods can be seen from the Bihar state, as people reside in the lower valley and near to the riverbank due to their dependency on river water. Similarly, the highest impact was from Bangladesh because of the high population density as well as the settlement density. The study provided a holistic spatial assessment of flood inundation in the region due to the combined impact of the Ganga-Brahmaputra River basin. The identification of highly flood-prone areas with an estimated impact on cropland and build-up will provide necessary information to decision-makers for flood risk reduction, mitigation activities, and management.

However, these changes are still rather uncertain, with only limited high-resolution results available and a lack of fundamental knowledge on the processes leading to sub-daily extremes. Here, we study the response of hourly extremes in a convection-permitting regional climate model (CPRCM) for an idealized warming experiment-repeating present-day observed weather under warmer and moister conditions. Ten months of simulation covering summer and early autumn for two domains over western Central Europe and western Mediterranean are performed. In general, we obtain higher sensitivities to warming for local-scale extreme precipitation at the original grid-scale of 2.5-3 km than for aggregated analyses at a scale of 12-15 km, representative for currently conventional regional climate models. The grid-scale sensitivity over sea, and in particular over the Mediterranean Sea, approaches 12%-16% increase per degree, close to two times the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation. In contrast, over the dry parts of Spain the sensitivity is close to the CC rate of 6%-7% per degree. For other land areas, sensitivities are in between these two values, with a tendency for the cooler and more humid areas to show lower scaling rates for the most intense hourly precipitation, whereas the land area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea shows the opposite behaviour with the largest increases projected for the most extreme hourly precipitation intensities. While our experimental setup only estimates the thermodynamic response of extremes due to moisture increases, and neglects a number of large-scale feedbacks that may temper future increases in precipitation extremes, some of the sensitivities reported here reflect findings from observational trends. Therefore, our results can provide guidance within which to understand recent observed trends and for future climate projections with CPRCMs.	[Lenderink, Geert; van Meijgaard, Erik; van Ulft, Bert; de Vries, Hylke] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Belusic, Danijel; Kjellstrom, Erik; Lind, Petter] SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Fowler, Hayley J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England	Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Newcastle University - UK	Lenderink, G (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands.	geert.lenderink@knmi.nl	Belusic, Danijel/E-5672-2012; Lenderink, Geert/ACB-1808-2022; Fowler, Hayley J/A-9591-2013; Kjellström, Erik/AAF-5947-2020	Belusic, Danijel/0000-0002-5665-3866; Kjellstrom, Erik/0000-0002-6495-1038; Fowler, Hayley/0000-0001-8848-3606	European Union Horizon 2020 IMPREX project [641811]; INTENSE project from the European Research Council [ERC-2013-CoG-617329]; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society [WM140025]; Swedish research program MSB-HazardSupport; NERC [NE/R01079X/1] Funding Source: UKRI	European Union Horizon 2020 IMPREX project; INTENSE project from the European Research Council; Wolfson Foundation; Royal Society(Royal Society); Swedish research program MSB-HazardSupport; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))	GL, BvU, PL, DB, EK, and EvM acknowledge financial support from the European Union Horizon 2020 IMPREX project, Grant agreement No 641811 (http://imprex.eu) and GL and HJF were supported by the INTENSE project from the European Research Council (Grant ERC-2013-CoG-617329).

Extreme flooding and its discharge are highly sensitive to regional climate change. Presently, its discharge can be reconstructed by a geological archive or record along the river valley. Two units of typical extreme flooding deposits (EFDs) carrying long-term information preserved in the Holocene loess-palaeosol sequence were found at Xipocun (XPC), which is located in Chengcheng County. China. It is situated in the downstream section of the Beiluohe (hereafter BLH) River. Based on multiple sedimentary proxy indices (grain-size distribution (G5D), magnetic susceptibility (MS), and loss-on-ignition (LOI), etc.), EFDs were interpreted as well-sorted clayey silt in suspension. They were then deposited as a result of riverbank flooding in a stagnant environment during high water level. Through the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating technique and stratigraphic correlations, chronologies of two identified extreme flooding periods were 7600 7400 a B.P. and 3200-3000 a B.P. Two phases of extreme flooding occurrence under climate abnormality scenarios were characterized as having high frequencies of hydrological extremes in river systems. According to simulation and verification using the Slope-Area Method and Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model, the extreme flooding discharges at the XPC site were reconstructed between 9625 m(3)/s and 16,635 m(3)/s. A new long-term flooding frequency and peak discharge curve, involved gauged flooding, historical flooding at Zhuangtou station and in situ reconstructed extreme flooding events, was established for the downstream BLH River. The results improve the accuracy of low-frequency flooding risk assessment and provide evidence for predicting the response of fluvial systems to climate instability. Thus, this improves the analysis of the BLH River watershed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Dunkerley, DL				Dunkerley, David L.			Rainfall intensity bursts and the erosion of soils: an analysis highlighting the need for high temporal resolution rainfall data for research under current and future climates	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; DAILY TEMPERATURE; WATER EROSION; OVERLAND-FLOW; FOWLERS GAP; FLASH-FLOOD; IMPACTS; INDEXES; EVENTS; MODELS	Many land surface processes, including splash dislodgment and downslope transport of soil materials, are influenced strongly by short-lived peaks in rainfall intensity but are less well accounted for by longer-term average rates. Specifically, rainfall intensities reached over periods of 10-30 min appear to have more explanatory power than hourly or longer-period data. However, most analyses of rainfall, and particularly scenarios of possible future rainfall extremes under climate change, rely on hourly data. Using two Australian pluviograph records with 1 s resolution, one from an arid and one from a wet tropical climate, the nature of short-lived "intensity bursts" is analysed from the raw inter-tip times of the tipping bucket gauges. Hourly apparent rainfall intensities average just 1.43 mm h(-1) at the wet tropical site and 2.12 mm h(-1) at the arid site. At the wet tropical site, intensity bursts of extreme intensity occur frequently, those exceeding 30 mm h(-1) occurring on average at intervals of < 1 d and those of > 60 mm h(-1) occurring on average at intervals of < 2 d. These bursts include falls of 13.2 mm in 4.4 min, the equivalent of 180 mm h(-1), and 29 mm in 12.6 min, equivalent to 138 mm h(-1). Intensity bursts at the arid site are much less frequent, those of 50-60 mm h(-1) occurring at intervals of similar to 1 month; moreover, the bursts have a much shorter duration. The aggregation of rainfall data to hourly level conceals the occurrence of many of these short-intensity bursts, which are potentially highly erosive. A short review examines some of the mechanisms through which intensity bursts affect infiltration, overland flow, and soil dislodgment. It is proposed that more attention to resolving these short-lived but important aspects of rainfall climatology is warranted, especially in light of possible changes in rainfall extremes under climate change.

To help understand and manage climate risks to food security in Southern Africa it is essential to quantify the present-day likelihood and magnitude of climate extremes in South Africa's maize-growing region and explore the potential for unprecedented climate conditions which would likely result in record low maize yields. We analyse a large ensemble of initialised climate model simulations, which provides almost 100 times as many plausible present-day summers as the equivalent observational dataset. We quantify the risk of unprecedented climate extremes affecting maize production in South Africa and examine the role of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. We find that the South African maize region is at risk of experiencing record-breaking hot, cold, dry or wet events under current climatic conditions. We find that the annual chance of unprecedented high temperatures in South Africa is approximately 4%, increasing to 62% during very strong El Nino years. We also find that the chance of exceeding the present day seasonal high temperature record has increased across the 1979-2018 period, being five times more likely now than it was in 1980. These extreme events could result in a record-breaking number of days above the optimum, or even the maximum, temperature for maize production, and lead to more severe floods or droughts. Under climate change scenarios, the magnitude and frequency of climate extremes is projected to increase meaning that the unprecedented extremes studied here could become commonplace in the future. This suggests that significant investment is needed to develop adaptations that manage the climate-related risks to food systems now and build resilience to the projected impacts of climate change.

In this study, the heavy rainfall and flash flood processes were studied as a system. Taking the driving factors of the heavy rainfall causing the flash floods as the main focus, the key factors of the heavy rainfall causing typical flash flood processes were identified, and the driving mechanism by which the heavy rainfall caused flash floods was revealed. Through comparative analysis of the rainfall related to 13 floods with peak discharges of greater than 2000 m(3)/s since measurements began at Baijiachuan hydrological station, it was found that different rainfall factors played a major driving role in the different flood factors. The factor that had the largest impact on the peak discharge was the average rainfall intensity; the factor that had the largest impact on the flood volume was the rainfall duration; and the factor that had the largest impact on the sediment volume was the maximum 1 h rainfall. The ecological construction of soil and water conservation projects on the Loess Plateau has had obvious peak-cutting and sediment-reducing effects on the flood processes driven by medium- and low-intensity rainfall events, but for high-intensity flash floods, the flood-reducing and sediment-reducing effects of these projects have been smaller. Therefore, despite the background of continuous ecological improvement on the Loess Plateau, the possibility of floods with large sediment loads occurring in the middle reaches of the Yellow River still exists.

In South Africa, rural areas and small towns generally depend on a limited and climate-sensitive economic base (e.g., farming), and they have a limited capacity and are located in areas where transport challenges can increase WASH access risks. Climate change shifts hydrological cycles, which can worsen WASH access and increase susceptibility to the interlinked impacts of droughts and flooding in already vulnerable regions. We adopted a transdisciplinary approach to explore the needs, barriers, and vulnerabilities with respect to WASH in rural areas and small towns in South Africa-using two case studies to explore climate risk and vulnerability assessment (CRVA) in one rural village in the northern Limpopo province and a small town in the Western Cape province. This holistic approach considered natural (environment and climate) and socio-economic (economic, social, governance, and political) factors and how they interplay in hampering access to WASH. Extreme weather events characterized by frequent and intense droughts or floods aggravate surface and groundwater availability and damage water infrastructure while threatening agriculture-dependent livelihoods. The lack of reliable transport infrastructure increases risks posed by flooding as roads to vital supplies are prone to damage. High inequality linked to rising unemployment and the Apartheid legacy of a segregated service delivery system result in inequitable access to WASH services. The intertwined ways in which natural elements and historical, social, economic, governance, and policy aspects are changing in South Africa increase WASH vulnerability in rural areas and small towns.</p>	[Abrams, Amber L.; Carden, Kirsty; Teta, Charles; Wagsaether, Katinka] Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa	University of Cape Town	Abrams, AL (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Future Water Res Inst, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.	amber.abrams@uct.ac.za; Kirsty.Carden@uct.ac.za; Charles.teta@uct.ac.za; katinka.l.w@gmail.com	Abrams, Amber L/AAC-7533-2022; Carden, Kirsty/G-2678-2015	Abrams, Amber L/0000-0003-1416-7891; Teta, Charles/0000-0002-0732-0272; Carden, Kirsty/0000-0003-2760-2418	University of Bristol using quality-related research (QR); UK Research and Innovation; Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)	University of Bristol using quality-related research (QR); UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)	Funding This research was funded through a collaboration agreement with the University of Bristol using quality-related research (QR) funding from the UK Research and Innovation (see www.ukri.org, accessed on 24 February 2020) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) on a project entitled: Understanding Vulnerability and Health Impacts of Climate Change in South Africa.		58	13	13	6	23	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	OCT	2021	13	20							2810	10.3390/w13202810	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13202810			20	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WP5CV		gold, Green Published			2024-04-22	WOS:000713150500001

In order to assess potential future changes in flood seasonality in the Rhine River basin, we analyse changes in streamflow, snowmelt, precipitation and evapotranspiration at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 degrees C global warming levels. The mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) forced with an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (five general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways) is used to simulate the present and future climate conditions of both pluvial and nival hydrological regimes. Our results indicate that future changes in flood characteristics in the Rhine River basin are controlled by increases in antecedent precipitation and diminishing snowpacks. In the pluvial-type sub-basin of the Moselle River, an increasing flood potential due to increased antecedent precipitation encounters declining snowpacks during winter. The decrease in snowmelt seems to counterbalance increasing precipitation, resulting in only small and transient changes in streamflow maxima. For the Rhine Basin at Basel, rising temperatures cause changes from solid to liquid precipitation, which enhance the overall increase in precipitation sums, particularly in the cold season. At the gauge at Basel, the strongest increases in streamflow maxima show up during winter, when strong increases in liquid precipitation encounter almost unchanged snowmelt-driven runoff. The analysis of snowmelt events for the gauge at Basel suggests that at no point in time during the snowmelt season does a warming climate result in an increase in the risk of snowmelt-driven flooding. Snowpacks are increasingly depleted with the course of the snowmelt season. We do not find indications of a transient merging of pluvial and nival floods due to climate warming. To refine attained results, next steps need to be the representation of glaciers and lakes in the model set-up, the coupling of simulations to a streamflow component model and an independent validation of the snow routine using satellite-based snow cover maps.

The influence of anthropogenic climate change on wet and dry summers in Europe	SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Attribution; Hydrological extremes; Anthropogenic climate change; European droughts; European floods	TEMPERATURE IMPACTS; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; ATTRIBUTION; FLOOD; 21ST-CENTURY; PROJECTIONS; WEATHER; EVENTS	Understanding the role of anthropogenic forcings in regional hydrological changes can help communities plan their adaptation in an informed manner. Here we apply attribution research methods to investigate the effect of human influence on historical trends in wet and dry summers and changes in the likelihood of extreme events in Europe. We employ an ensemble of new climate models and compare experiments with and without the effect of human influence to assess the anthropogenic contribution. Future changes are also analysed with projections to year 2100. We employ two drought indices defined relative to the pre-industrial climate: one driven by changes in rainfall only and one that also includes the effect of temperature via changes in potential evapotranspiration. Both indices suggest significant changes in European summers have already emerged above variability and are expected to intensify in the future, leading to widespread dryer conditions which are more extreme in the south. When only the effect of rainfall is considered, there is a distinct contrast between a shift towards wetter conditions in the north and dryer in the south of the continent, as well as an overall increase in variability. However, when the effect of warming is also included, it largely masks the wet trends in the north, resulting in increasingly drier summers across most of the continent. Historical index trends are already detected in the observations, while models suggest that what were extremely dry conditions in the pre-industrial climate will become normal in the south by the end of the century.

On the use of synthetic tropical cyclones and hypothetical events for storm surge assessment under climate change	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Natural hazards; Public policy; Risk management; Risk atlas; Hurricanes	FLOOD-RISK; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HURRICANE RISK; HAZARD; SIMULATION; FREQUENCY; MODEL; WAVES; IMPACT; WIND	This study presents a new approach to assess storm surge risk from tropical cyclones under climate change by direct calculation of the local flood levels using a limited number of events with an associated probability. The approach is based on the near-worst-case flood scenario, associated with a known tropical cyclone wind intensity probability (return period). We applied the method for the locality of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, using synthetic tropical cyclones derived from six different general circulation models for the present and future climates under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The synthetic events allowed the characterization of the wind intensity for the present and future climates for a given return period, as well as to determine the key tropical cyclones parameters related to storm surge. For Hurricane Patricia (2015), the strongest tropical cyclone to impact the region, we determined that its 95 m/s winds have a return period above 4000 years for the present climate and 198 years in a future climate scenario. Using Hurricane Patricia's peak wind intensity, we created hypothetical events representing all possible approaches of tropical cyclones (211 events) to Manzanillo. We forced a hydrodynamic model with the hypothetical events over a mesh created with LiDAR-derived topography and then calculated the storm surge to create the near-worst-case flood scenario based on the maximum envelopes of water (MEOWs) and the maximum of MEOWs. Using those results, we created flood risk maps at city block level based on the combination of flood hazard and socioeconomic vulnerability maps. The presented method provides a tool for tropical cyclones storm surge hazard and risk assessment by generating near-worst-case flood maps under projected climates using a limited set of hypothetical events.

J	Jamshed, A; Birkmann, J; Feldmeyer, D; Rana, IA				Jamshed, Ali; Birkmann, Joern; Feldmeyer, Daniel; Rana, Irfan Ahmad			A Conceptual Framework to Understand the Dynamics of Rural-Urban Linkages for Rural Flood Vulnerability	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						disaster risk; holistic approach; rural-urban relationships; regional development; vulnerability dynamics; rural flooding	CLIMATE-CHANGE VULNERABILITY; SOCIAL NETWORKS; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; CITY SIZE; RISK; MIGRATION; COMMUNITIES; DISASTER; DETERMINANTS; LIVELIHOODS	Rural areas are highly vulnerable to floods due to limited social, economic, and physical resources. Understanding rural vulnerability is vital for developing effective disaster risk reduction strategies. Even though rural areas and cities are intrinsically linked, rural vulnerability was assessed without considering its relation to cities. Numerous theoretical frameworks on systemizing and assessing vulnerability were developed with varying level of scope and depth in terms of scale, dimensions, and components. Nevertheless, these frameworks did not explicitly mention the impact of flood or other hazards on the linkages between spatial units i.e., rural and urban. This study aims to understand and conceptualize the rural vulnerability with respect to the dynamics of rural-urban linkages in the case of flood events. To do so, current literature on rural-urban linkages, vulnerability, as well as factors that influence them were critically reviewed. Taking into account the main elements of rural-urban linkages (flow of people, information, finances, goods and services), components of vulnerability (exposure, susceptibility, and capacity), and factors (social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, spatial, and environmental), a unified framework is proposed. The framework underscores that the role of rural-urban linkages is essential to fully understand rural flood vulnerability. Moreover, the framework highlights the role of spatial factors-city size and proximity to the city-as crucial to comprehend rural vulnerability. This framework can be used as a tool for understanding multifaceted rural vulnerability for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction considering spatial development perspective. In this context, empirical investigations can be made to validate the proposed framework and policies can be introduced accordingly. Overall, the proposed framework can help recognize concepts and links of vulnerability, rural-urban dependencies, and rural development dynamics.

J	Rosas, MA; Vanacker, V; Viveen, W; Gutierrez, RR; Huggel, C				Rosas, Miluska A.; Vanacker, Veerle; Viveen, Willem; Gutierrez, Ronald R.; Huggel, Christian			The potential impact of climate variability on siltation of Andean reservoirs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Soil Erosion; Sediment transport; Climate change; Andes; Hydroelectric projects; Storage dams; Extreme Events	FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; SEDIMENT YIELD; SPATIAL VARIATION; DENUDATION RATES; EROSION RATES; RIVER; CALIBRATION; BASIN; CHALLENGES	Recent changes in global climate, and especially changes in precipitation patterns, may negatively impact on siltation of Andean storage reservoirs, thereby putting at risk the provision of resources to the local population. The extent to which this may happen is poorly understood. We therefore studied the catchment of the Canete River in the western Peruvian Coastal Range as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region. It houses the 220 MW El Platanal hydroelectric plant and the Capillucas reservoir that provide the surrounding areas with water and energy. We used a hydrological model (HEC-HMS) coupled with a sediment transport model (HEC-RAS) to simulate future changes in river discharge and sediment load. This information was then used to calculate the siltation of the Capillucas storage reservoir. Ten scenarios were developed, a combination of two different precipitation patterns and five different precipitation rates. The precipitation patterns differed in the distribution of the precipitation change during the rainfall season, and the precipitation rates differed in the extent of change in precipitation amounts. The average sediment load of the Canete River was estimated at 981 kTon/yr upstream of the Capillucas reservoir and showed that the calculated life span of the Capillucas reservoir is about 17 years. The most pessimistic scenario suggested a reduction in the life span of the reservoir to 7 years and the most optimistic scenario to 31 years. Even under the most optimistic scenario, the life span of the reservoir is shorter than its officially expected functionality of 50 years. As such, our results demonstrated the vulnerability of Andean hydroelectric reservoirs against future climate change.

Sea level rise scenario for 2100 AD for the archaeological site of Motya	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI			English	Article						Motya archaeological site; Sea level rise; UAV survey; Digital surface model; GPS; Tide gauge; Flooding scenarios	FLOODING SCENARIO; COAST	In this study, we analyze the impact of the sea level rise induced by climate change on the coastal cultural heritage site of Motya, the Phoenician colony (IV-III millennium B.P.) located in the San Pantaleo island, NW corner of Sicily (southern Italy). In particular, we assessed the effects of this phenomenon on the human settlement in the past 2400 years and the expected sea level rise scenario for the next decades. A detailed flooding scenario for 2100 from direct observations and two models, taking into account the contribution of Vertical Land Movements (VLM), is provided. The surface topography is derived from a novel high-resolution/high-accuracy digital surface model (DSM), which was performed through an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) survey, whereas the rate of VLM was estimated by the analysis of geodetic data at three Continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) stations located close to the island. To estimate the local mean sea level and to correct the tide level (TL) at the epoch of UAV survey, the hydrometric recordings of the nearest sea level gauge station located at Porto Empedocle (Sicily), were used. Two flooding scenarios for 2100 were then represented on the high-resolution DSM, using the regional sea-level projections of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the Mediterranean region. According to the RCP 8.5 climatic model, a difference of about + 59 cm above the local mean sea level between the current and the expected coastline positions at 2100 A.D., was found. In addition, by adding the average half amplitude of the daily tide, equal to about 30 cm, a maximum flooding scenario was determined. Finally, in the maximum condition of sea level rise, a significant flooding on the archaeological structures is expected for the Kothon area and along the North-West coast of the island.

J	Lal, A; Fearnley, E; Wilford, E				Lal, Aparna; Fearnley, Emily; Wilford, Emily			Local weather, flooding history and childhood diarrhoea caused by the parasite <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp.: A systematic review and meta-analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Climate; Children; Infectious; Health; Spatial	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH-RISKS; DISEASE; CHILDREN; IMPACTS; BURDEN; TRENDS; SANITATION; MORTALITY; WATER	Scientists have long predicted the impacts of climate-related infectious disease emergence. Yet, the combined effect of local socioeconomic and demographic factors and weather variation on child health is poorly understood. With a focus on childhood diarrhoea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium spp., - an infection easily controlled by public health interventions but also strongly linked to environmental conditions through waterborne spread, we systematically review and empirically model the effects of local weather and flooding history, after controlling for seasonality, publication bias, access to improved sanitation, health resources and population density at a global scale. We examined 1588 papers on childhood cryptosporidiosis and identified 36 studies representing a range of geographic locations and climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. Local rainfall and population density were related with cryptosporidiosis across latitudes as shown by mixed effects, spatio-temporal models for equatorial, subtropical and temperate climates. In equatorial (0-20 degrees) latitudes, the previous month's rainfall and population density were inversely related with childhood cryptosporidiosis with a significant random effect for flooding history. In tropical-subtropical (20-35 degrees) latitudes, rainfall in December was inversely related with cryptosporidiosis, compared to rainfall in April (the wet season). In temperate latitudes (>35 degrees), there was a significant negative association of reported disease with population density. This global empirical analysis indicates differential spatio-temporal patterns of childhood cryptosporidiosis in low, mid and high latitude regions. Models that couple weather conditions with demographic factors are needed to assess disease distributional shifts and risks due to environmental change. These results may provide impetus to develop environment-focused public health policies to manage disease risks associated with climate change for future generations.

J	Greenwalt, D				Greenwalt, Dustin			Becoming Flood: Composing Anxious Assemblages in Flood Wall Street	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Climate justice; anxiety; affect; assemblages; protest		This essay identifies anxious assemblages as a powerful rhetorical strategy used by organizers of the 2014 Flood Wall Street protest in New York City's financial district. Anxious assemblages may disrupt the reduction of protest to acts of individual expression while promoting intra-movement solidarity. Drawing together literatures about assemblages and anxiety, I show how circulating signs and images on social media can propel protests that repeat and modulate pre-existing expressions of anxiety. I then use visual and textual methods to demonstrate how Flood Wall Street emerged from a Twitter campaign to transform protestors into a flood or bodies that predicted global climate chaos and spurred participants' ongoing agitation against the causes of climate change. This essay provides an important analytical tool for analyzing the repetitive and collective tactics now popular among climate justice organizations, explaining how they promote intragroup solidarity and elicit further agitation.

However, this is being lost due to natural decay but also climatic changes and natural hazards. To preserve it, it is important to understand the influence of such actions. Timber joints significantly affect the mechanical performances of timber-framed buildings, being the weakest element. In this paper, results are presented from cyclic pull-out test conducted on traditional timber joints subjected to wind driven rain and flood, both unreinforced and retrofitted, and a comparison is made with those obtained from sound specimens.

J	Marvuglia, A; Koppelaar, R; Rugani, B				Marvuglia, Antonino; Koppelaar, Rembrandt; Rugani, Benedetto			The effect of green roofs on the reduction of mortality due to heatwaves: Results from the application of a spatial microsimulation model to four European cities	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Nature-based solutions (NBS); Individual-based models; Heatwave mortality; Green roofs; Climate change adaptation	AGENT-BASED MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT WAVES; TEMPERATURE; RISK; QUALITY; HEALTH; ACCLIMATIZATION; INFRASTRUCTURE; EXPOSURE	Embedding nature-based solutions (NBS) in cities is expected to bring quantifiable benefits, including resilience to flooding, drought, and heatwaves, and air quality improvement. Among NBS, green roofs have an important role in temperature regulation in buildings and in lowering the damaging effects of heatwaves on human health. In this paper a spatial microsimulation model is implemented to simulate temperature impacts of green roofs installations in cities and their capacity to attenuate the effects of heatwave episodes. Particularly vulnerable to heatwaves are elderly people with limited mobility, who have limited means to seek cooling and create cooler indoor environments. The model, implemented using the Netlogo platform (version 6.0.4), considers as agents the elderly citizens in a city area and simulates the heatwave-related health impacts, which are measured in mortality likelihood. In particular, the model simulates a generalised 1.5 degrees C to 3 degrees C indoor temperature reduction range induced by green roofs (based on inferences from green roof literature) in four different European cities: Szeged (Hungary), Alcal'a de Henares (Spain), Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy) and Cankaya municipality (Turkey). The simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach, meaning that the relationships of the observed phenomenon (mortality induced by heatwaves) with other possible influencing factors (e.g. level of sport and physical activities practiced by people) are not taken into account. In the case of Szeged, Alcal'a de Henares, and Cankaya municipality a substantial reduction in mortality is found to occur associated with green roofs roll out. In the case of the Metropolitan city of Milan, green roofs installations show a low mitigation effect in some scenarios. The underlying factor is the temperature threshold parameter of the model, above which heatwave mortality occurs. This parameter was inferred from the literature (Baccini M., et al., 2008) and it resulted to be substantially higher in the Metropolitan city of Milan (31.8 degrees C) than in the other cities. The simulation helps in obtaining results which are specific to a given city and particular scenarios therein, and provides additional insights, such as expected temperature mitigation effect induced by green roofs under climate change conditions, or the indoor temperature reduction targets that are needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired heatwave mitigation impact. However, the model parameters have to be carefully selected, after an accurate study of the domain literature.

Therefore, they contribute to the local adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Mangroves have different characteristics that origin mangrove ecological types. There are few studies on mangroves in karstic environments, where there is spatial heterogeneity associated with topography-hydroperiod-nutrient interactions. To estimate the total carbon stock in mangroves and determine whether carbon storage differs according to the mangrove ecological type in a natural protected area in the karstic region of the Yucatan Peninsula (northern Ria Celestun Biosphere Reserve), a study was conducted following the recommendations of the IPCC Good Practice Supplement for wetlands and standardized methods used in mangroves studies around the world. According to the results, mangroves associated with springs, called "petenes" or hammock mangroves, showed higher total ecosystem carbon stock (683.7 Mg C ha(-1)) than fringe, basin, and dwarf mangrove ecological types (429, 385, and 214 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). Above- and below-ground carbon stock was different between mangrove ecological types. Carbon stock variation was related to environmental hydrology variables (flooding level, interstitial water salinity, and redox potential). According to the delta C-13 analysis from the surface soil, carbon accumulated in mangrove sediments in a karstic scenario is mainly autochthonous and predominantly originates from mangrove leaves. Carbon stock in mangroves in the northern Ria Celestun Biosphere Reserve was 9.7 Tg C, of which 40.7% comes from dwarf mangroves due to their extension. These results could be used as a tool for developing specific management actions at regional or local scales for mangrove restoration and conservation.

This study provides comprehensive scenarios of current and future ESLs at the local scale along the bay to understand the evolution of the phenomenon and promote local adaptation. The methodological steps involve first reconstructing historical storm tide and wave run-up data using a hydrodynamic model (D-flow FM) and the empirical model of Stockdon et al. Second, the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) model fitted to the Peaks-Over-Thresholds (POT) method is applied to the data to calculate extreme return levels. Third, we combine the extreme storm tide and wave run-up using the joint probability method to obtain the current ESLs. Finally, the current ESLs are integrated with recent SLR projections to provide future ESL estimates. The results show that the current ESLs are relatively high, with 100-year return levels of 4.37 m +/- 0.51, 4.97 m +/- 0.57, and 4.48 m +/- 0.5 at Vridi, Petit-Bassam, and Sogefiha respectively. By end-century, under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the future SLR is expected to increase the current ESLs by 0.49 m, 0.62 m, and 0.84 m, respectively. This could lead to a more frequent occurrence of the current 100-year return period, happening once every 2 years by 2100, especially under SSP5-8.5. The developed SLR scenarios can be used to assess the potential coastal flood risk in the study area for sustainable and effective coastal management and planning.

Alluvial fans at Cala Gonone (Sardinia), a fast developing touristic village: origins, hazards and potential risks	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Climate change; Debris flows; Sheet flood; Glacial stadial; Late Quaternary	STRATIFIED SLOPE DEPOSITS; PRECIPITATING EVENTS; COASTAL EVOLUTION; HUMAN IMPACT; SYSTEM; PLEISTOCENE; FACIES; COLLUVIUM; CANYON; SEA	The study area of Cala Gonone in NE Sardinia (Italy) consists of a wide terraced re-entrance/valley crowned inland by carbonate hills and, near the coast bounded laterally and partly floored by thin basaltic lava lying over carbonate bedrock. In this re-entrance, several inland alluvial fans (500 m length by 700 m wide) have developed, and a local similar to 30 m high, about 10 m wide (thick), 400 m long scarp body-remnant of semi-consolidated alluvial fan deposits is exposed along the coast. The fans experience depositional events mostly developed during the late Pleistocene. They although nowadays dormant may be reactivated by major rainstorms during strong climate changes. In these last few decades, the touristic village of Cala Gonone has been rapidly expanding over the mid to lower parts of two coalescing alluvial fans (Stadium and Gustui) and along the coastal marine scarp edge (Palmasera alluvial fan system). The village thus may become exposed to natural hazards if extreme climatic conditions may re-occur. Moreover, rock falls and the instability of the costal scarp due to wave erosion may add addition hazards for habitations built near the scarp crest and visitors to the frontal replenished beach. As commonly occurring elsewhere since antiquity, the risk perception of such events is low because of the centennial, millennial of longer recurrence. Such perception does not negate the hazards but a long event recurrence may be accepted as a reasonable risk for the human's activity. Nevertheless, serious consideration should be given to potential problems and plan and build for amelioration and defense. The evidence of what environmentally did and could still happen in the Cala Gonone and similar other area is in part clearly imprinted on the landscape: geology, geomorphology, and relative details in the stratigraphy and sedimentology of the deposits.

However, even in low-lying, flood prone countries like the Netherlands, climate change, weather extremes, economic growth, urbanization, land subsidence and increased food production will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors. Furthermore, the frequency and amplitude of extremely dry and wet weather conditions is expected to increase. The current Dutch water management system is not designed to anticipate these extremes. Over the last decades, drained Dutch agricultural fields, land consolidation and urbanization resulted in declining groundwater tables. Additionally, the fresh water demand of different sectors (agriculture, industry, drinking water) increased, causing an increased pressure on the regional groundwater system. As a consequence, the annual groundwater table in sandy soil areas dropped over time with the effect that, nowadays, fresh water is becoming scarce in dry periods. In this paper we provide insight in the shifting water management strategy in the Netherlands (1950-2020), with the corresponding drainage systems, developing from conventional drainage (approx. 1950-1990), to controlled drainage (1990's onwards), climate adaptive drainage (2010 onwards) and subirrigation systems (2018 onwards). Furthermore, we provide insight in the effect of subirrigation on groundwater levels and crop yields, based on both international literature and measurements of Dutch field pilots. Although subirrigation can contribute to improved soil moisture conditions for crop growth on field scale, we show that the water volume needed for subirrigation can be large and could put a significant pressure on the available regional water sources. Therefore, efficient and responsible use of the available external water sources for subirrigation (e.g. surface water, treated waste water, or groundwater) is required. Finally, the implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation asks for correct implementation in the regional balance: it requires an integral, catchment-wide approach.	[de Wit, J. A.

J	Luque, P; Gómez-Pujol, L; Marcos, M; Orfila, A				Luque, Pau; Gomez-Pujol, Lluis; Marcos, Marta; Orfila, Alejandro			Coastal Flooding in the Balearic Islands During the Twenty-First Century Caused by Sea-Level Rise and Extreme Events	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal flooding; beach erosion; sea-level rise; Western mediterranean; Balearic islands	CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION; SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT; CHOICE EXPERIMENT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; BEACHES; MODEL; CONSEQUENCES; SCENARIOS; SHORELINE	Sea-level rise induces a permanent loss of land with widespread ecological and economic impacts, most evident in urban and densely populated areas. Potential coastline retreat combined with waves and storm surges will result in more severe damages for coastal zones, especially over insular systems. In this paper, we quantify the effects of sea-level rise in terms of potential coastal flooding and potential beach erosion, along the coasts of the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean Sea), during the twenty-first century. We map projected flooded areas under two climate-change-driven mean sea-level rise scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), together with the impact of an extreme event defined by the 100-year return level of joint storm surges and waves. We quantify shoreline retreat of sandy beaches forced by the sea-level rise (scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and the continuous action of storm surges and waves (modeled by synthetic time series). We estimate touristic recreational services decrease of sandy beaches caused by the obtained shoreline retreat, in monetary terms. According to our calculations, permanent flooding by the end of our century will extend 7.8-27.7 km(2) under the RCP4.5 scenario (mean sea-level rise between 32 and 80 cm by 2100), and up to 10.9-36.5 km(2) under RCP8.5 (mean sea-level rise between 46 and 103 cm by 2100). Some beaches will lose more than 50% of their surface by the end of the century: 20-50% of them under RCP4.5 scenario and 25-60% under RCP8.5 one. Loss of touristic recreational services could represent a gross domestic product (GDP) loss up to 7.2% with respect to the 2019 GDP.

However, an advanced synthesis that characterizes the existing studies is lacking. In this review, we used citation network analysis and a text mining approach to identify research trends and extract common research topics and the emerging domains in urban climatology. Based on the clustered networks, we found that aerosols and ozone, and urban heat island are the most popular topics. Together with other clusters, four emerging topical fields were identified: secondary organic aerosols, urban precipitation, flood risk and adaptation, and greenhouse gas emissions. The city case studies' geographical information was analyzed to explore the spatial-temporal patterns, especially in the emerging topical fields. Interdisciplinary research grew in recent years as the field of urban climatology expanded to interact with urban hydrology, health, energy issues, and social sciences. A few knowledge gaps were proposed: the lack of long-term high-temporal-resolution observational data of organic aerosols for model validation and improvements, the need for predictions of urban effects on precipitation and extreme flooding events under climate change, and the lack of a framework for cooperation between physical sciences and social sciences under urban settings. To fill these gaps, we call for more observational data with high spatial and temporal resolution, using high-resolution models that adequately represent urban processes to conduct scenario analyses for urban planning, and the development of intellectual frameworks for better integration of urban climatology and social-economical systems in cities.

J	Avni, Y; Avni, G; Porat, N				Avni, Yoav; Avni, Gideon; Porat, Naomi			A review of the rise and fall of ancient desert runoff agriculture in the Negev Highlands - A model for the southern Levant deserts	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Review						Desert agriculture; Climate fluctuations; Resilience; Negev Highlands; Southern Levant	SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENT; DESERTIFICATION; PALEOCLIMATE; PLEISTOCENE; TRANSITION; INCISION; CLIMATES	The rise and fall of desert agriculture in the southern Levant has been debated among scholars for the last 200 years, in the chronological, the socio-political and the environmental context. Based on c. 31 OSL ages of sediments from agricultural terraces in various sites in the Negev Highlands, the main phase of ancient desert agriculture was dated to between the 3rd-4th centuries CE and the 10th-11th centuries CE (Avni et al., 2013). Within this longue duree process of agricultural activities, no significant environmental or climatic change was observed coinciding with the Byzantine-Islamic transition in the 7th century CE. Our research, which focused on the natural processes that influenced the rise and fall of the Negev desert agriculture, found that the agricultural installations were sustainable for at least 700 years and parts of these agricultural constructions are still in use today. This long period of usage is a clear indication of their robust design and their good adaptation to the desert environment, despite possible short-term climatic fluctuations. However, continuous flooding, gulling, soil erosion and siltation required constant maintenance of agricultural systems by the local farmers. In addition, the political and economic changes that followed the Byzantine-Islamic transition triggered a gradual decrease in the economic value of the products of desert agriculture, followed by a disruption of the social-political balance between local farmers and herders. These made the desert runoff agriculture less viable, leading to its final demise after the 10th century CE. Therefore, a direct link between the rise and fall of desert runoff agriculture and the claimed climatic changes in the southern Levant seems unlikely.

The age of the sediments and morphological features was based on radiocarbon datings, on the presence of archaeological settlements and ancient artefacts and on historical data. The aerial photographs of the GAI 1954 flight of the Italian Air Force were used because in the year 1954, some low terraces were still clearly visible, while today are almost completely obliterated because of the works for the improvement of the rice fields. A succession of nine fluvioglacial and fluvial terraces and many abandoned riverbeds have been identified: the interpretation of the morphological features made it possible to identify the Po and Dora Baltea evolution during the late Holocene. The study established that during the last 3000 years, the confluence of the Dora Baltea into the Po has constantly migrated to the west and that this migration occurred during alluvial phases dating back to the Iron Age, 2nd century BC-1st century AD, 5th century AD, 6th-8th century AD and 15th-19th century AD. The alluvial phases occurred during periods of increased floods in northern Italy and advances of the Alpine glaciers in northwestern Italy and Switzerland. Neither tectonic deformations nor anthropic actions seem to have influenced fluvial evolution in the last 3000 years. The westward migration of the confluence between the rivers was therefore triggered by climatic changes, but caused by the different responses of the catchments of the Dora Baltea and the Po rivers to climatic changes, and by the greater slope of the Dora Baltea flood plain.

J	Wannewitz, M; Garschagen, M				Wannewitz, Mia; Garschagen, Matthias			The role of social identities for collective adaptation capacities- general considerations and lessons from Jakarta, Indonesia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban diversity; Social identity; Group formation; Risk culture; Social capital	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; COMMUNITY; MULTICULTURALISM; DETERMINANTS; PSYCHOLOGY; MIGRATION; CULTURE; HAZARD	Cities worldwide increasingly host populations which are highly exposed and vulnerable to the effects of climate change and hence need to adapt, whilst featuring high degrees of socio-cultural diversity. Differences in local vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities are increasingly acknowledged, however, they are mostly explained by drawing on individual social categories such as age, gender, or health status. Given that residents' capacities to adapt are largely bound in their ability to work together, a stronger focus on social interaction and collaboration is needed, taking into account urban diversity. Using the example of Jakarta, the highly at-risk capital of Indonesia, we apply a qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews with key informants to examine the diversity of collective adaptation capacities among sub-groups within allegedly homogenous groups. Using a mix of deductive and inductive coding, we find that in the case of Jakarta, three social identities with differing adaptive capacities are highly relevant in the context of long-term collective adaptation to flooding. First, kinship and close neighborhood are characterized by very tight networks with limited capacities. Second, institutionalized local neighborhood groups with strict social norms and traditions. Third, cross-neighborhood, civil society supported groups have far-reaching capacities thanks to bridging and linking ties. The results extend current knowledge on collective adaptation capacities among hitherto ill-perceived and supposedly homogenous groups of "the most vulnerable". Findings therefore can be valuable for improving adaptation policies and programs, particularly in the field of supported adaptation.

A comprehensive framework using a vulnerability index approach and PCA analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Floods; Social vulnerability; Flood vulnerability index; PCA; GIS	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; HAZARD; CONTEXT; CATCHMENT	In recent years, the analysis of social vulnerability to floods became an integrated part of the flood risk management process, the strategies and policies developed focusing on risk reduction methods that increase the resilience of vulnerable communities. Therefore, reliable and robust social vulnerability approaches are needed, which is also highlighted by the increasing socio-economic growth and climate change related effects that can lead to unpredictable consequences. The use of vulnerability indices is the most widespread methodology that allows the identification of the most vulnerable communities and the understanding of the factors that increase vulnerability to floods. However, due to the lack of a standard procedure, the existing studies are often characterized by uncertainties related to subjective selection of indicators, lack of inclusion of all vulnerability dimensions, equal or subjective weighting methods, and reduced number of variables due to data unavailability. The present paper is addressing these gaps by developing a comprehensive methodology approach which: includes a large set of indicators that are selected considering the local socio-economic context, includes the hazard dimension in the analysis considering flood related variables, and applies objective weighting methods based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. Furthermore, flood vulnerability maps are developed using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, to provide a rapid and easy way to identify highly vulnerable areas. The results showed that the integration of statistical methods and GIS tools in the social vulnerability index construction provides a better understanding of the factors that increase the social vulnerability and offers an overview of the mitigation and adaptation measures that must be implemented by authorities in order to improve the flood risk management.

Monitoring such variability in this ecosystem service can guide adaptive management measures for sustainability.Aims This novel research for Australian, sought to quantify interannual changes in the freshwater recreational fisheries of five key (i.e. commonly caught) finfish species (Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii; golden perch, Macquaria ambigua; Australian bass, Percalates novemaculeata; brown trout, Salmo trutta; and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) in relation to a series of extreme climate-related events and the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods Annual estimates during 2013-14, 2017-18 and 2019-20 of freshwater fishing effort and catch across New South Wales, Australia, were derived from off-site surveys and compared in relation to a severe drought period, the 'Black Summer' bushfires, widespread flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which affected fish productivity or human mobility.Key results There were significant declines in fishing effort between 2013-14, the year preceding the extreme environmental events and the pandemic, and 2017-18 and 2019-20. Catch across the five species was also significantly lower in 2019-20. Catch of species such as golden perch and rainbow trout declined from 2013-14 to 2019-20.Conclusions and implications This study can inform adaptive measures against societal and climate-related changes in weather by enabling scientists and managers to identify problematic trends.

In this study we employed the dataset covering components of the water balance with a daily time step at the sub-basin level over the country for 1952-2020. The data set was derived from the previously calibrated and validated Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for over 4000 sub-basins. We applied the Mann Kendall test and circular statistics-based approach on annual maximum floods and various potential flood drivers to estimate the trend, seasonality, and relative importance of each driver. In addition, two sub-periods (1952-1985 and 1986-2020) were considered to examine changes in flood mechanism in the recent decades. We show that floods in the northeast Poland were decreasing, while in the south the trend showed a positive behavior. Moreover, the snowmelt is a primary driver of flooding across the country, followed by soil moisture excess and precipitation. The latter seemed to be the dominant driver only in a small, mountain-dominated region in the south. Soil moisture excess gained importance mainly in the northern part, suggesting that the spatial pattern of flood generation mechanisms is also governed by other features. We also found a strong signal of climate change in large parts of northern Poland, where snowmelt is losing importance in the second sub-period in favor of soil moisture excess, which can be explained by the temperature warming and diminishing role of snow processes.

Currently, climate change and socio-economic developments induce extreme -and diminishing floods, which in turn increase farmers' vulnerability. This research assesses farmers' adaptive capacity to hydrological changes using two prevalent farming systems: high dykes featuring triple-crop rice farming and low dykes where fields are left fallow during the flood season. We examine (1) farmers' perceptions on a changing flood regime and their current vulnerabilities and (2) farmers' adaptive capacity through five sustainability capitals. Methods include a literature review and qualitative interviews with farmers. Results show that extreme floods are becoming less frequent and damaging, depending on arrival time, depth, residence time, and flow velocity. In extreme floods, farmers' adaptive capacity is generally strong, and only low dyke farmers experience damage. As for diminishing floods, which is an emerging phenomenon, the overall adaptive capacity of farmers is remarkably weaker and varies between high-and low dyke farmers. Financial capital is lower for low dyke farmers due to their double-crop rice system, and natural capital is low for both farmer groups due to a decrease in soil-and water quality, affecting yields and increasing investment costs. Farmers also struggle with an unstable rice market due to strong fluctuating prices for seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs. We conclude that both high-and low dyke farmers have to cope with new challenges, including fluctuating flood patterns and the depletion of natural resources. Increasing farmers resilience should focus on exploring better crop varieties, adjusting crop calendars, and shifting to less water-intensive crops.

It has a significant effect on the ecosystem especially, irrigation and drainage system design and management, crop production, and flood and drought management. In this study, 11 global circulation models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) were investigated under three shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios for precipitation simulation and projection in the future period (2021-2050). Then, the results were compared with the base period (1985-2014). The research was conducted in the MENAP region. The evaluation of GCMs' performances by the Taylor diagram, R-2, MSE, MAE, and RMSE indices showed that among the 11 models, the MPI-ESM1-2-HR model with an average R-2 and RMSE of 0.6 and 18.9, respectively, was more accurate than other models in precipitation simulation in the entire region. The projection of precipitation indicated that the precipitation will mainly decrease except in areas such as the Black Sea, Mediterranean, and Red Sea coastal areas as well as mountainous and higher altitude regions in the eastern part of the study area. In addition, highest decrease rates will happen in the Middle East countries, Afghanistan, Morocco, Algeria, and Sudan. Based on different scenarios in the MENAP region, precipitation will vary between -77.3 and + 51.1 mm compared to the base period. Moreover, the lowest and highest precipitation changes were estimated based on SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. According to the various scenarios, the amount of precipitation in the future period will decrease compared to the historical period in most parts of the areas under study.

Since both climatic and non-climatic factors affect the river system, the study used rainfall variability as well as land use assessments in addition to the community-based assessment to assess the effects of changing environmental factors on the river water quality. It was found that frequent rainfall intensified the runoff into the Waimanu River of contaminants arising from unsustainable land use practices in the Waimanu Catchment including agriculture, gravel extraction, logging, deforestation, and improper waste management. These led to physicochemical and microbial pollution in the river which augmented the vulnerability of the riverine communities to water pollution by hampering their food, water, income, and health securities. The river water quality is expected to further deteriorate as future climate change projections predict an intensification of annual rainfall events, thereby increasing river water contamination and risks to aquatic life and human life. Non-climatic factors that endanger water quality could be controlled by implementing better upstream land and waste management strategies on a catchment scale to minimize the adverse impacts of declining water quality on downstream communities. Methodologies employed in this study to monitor and maintain river water quality are applicable on a global scale to promote the health and security of riverine communities.

WATER			English	Article						pluvial floods; fluvial floods; climate change; flood hazard	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; OBSERVED TRENDS; CLIMATE; PROJECTIONS; REDUCTION; HAZARD; EUROPE	The aim of this paper is accurately framed in its title: Are pluvial and fluvial (river) floods on the rise? First, physical mechanisms that drive changes in hazard of pluvial and fluvial floods were examined. Then, a review of literature was undertaken on detection and an attribution of changes in hazard of pluvial and fluvial floods in observation records for past to present, as well as in model-based projections for the future. Various aspects, factors, processes and mechanisms, as well as various indices of interest were considered. There is quite a common, even if not scientifically justified, belief that, generally, floods are on the rise. However, in this paper, a balanced, knowledge-based assessment was undertaken, with discussion and interpretation, including caveats and indicating considerable departures from such a flat-rate statement. Observation records show that precipitation extremes have been intensifying on a global scale and for many regions. A formal detection and attribution analysis shows that intensification of rainfall events may have been influenced by greenhouse gas forcing of anthropogenic origin. Frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods is on the rise with increasing intense precipitation, while changes of river floods are more complex. High river discharges were found to increase in some regions, but to decrease in other regions, so that no general corollaries can be drawn at the global scale. Heavy rainfall events and pluvial floods are projected to become, almost ubiquitously, more frequent and more intense with progressing climate change, while frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods are likely to increase in many but not all regions.

The general circulation model (GCM) outputs are used to derive hydrological conditions under future climate scenarios. Although GCMs are often downscaled to the point of interest, there can still be significant differences between modelled climate scenarios and historically observed climate scenarios. Therefore, the changes between the model simulated baseline and future scenarios are applied to observed baseline values to derive projected future values. In IJF modelling, such projected values are provided as input (boundary conditions) to assess the frequency and severity of future IJF events. Different methods can be used to calculate the climate change signal (difference between model-simulated future vs model-simulated historical conditions), and depending upon the method employed, results can vary. In this study, we evaluate the impact of using different delta change methods (i.e., absolute vs relative) to directly bias-correct the hydrological model output on the assessment of frequency and severity of IJFs under future climate. The method was tested in the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray in western Canada, an ice jam-prone location, to assess the IJF probabilities and intensities in the 2041-2070 period. Our results indicate that there is a notable difference in the projected frequency and severity of IJFs between absolute and relative delta change approaches, suggesting the methods should be carefully selected and results cautiously interpreted.

Many regions around the globe experienced high aerosol loadings because of intensive emissions, yet the roles of atmospheric aerosols in extreme meteorological and air pollution events have not been well demonstrated due mainly to the complexity of atmospheric physical and chemical interaction at mesoscale and even microscale. Here, we present a comprehensive review of current understanding on the role of atmospheric aerosols in the development and evolution of extreme meteorological events, including monsoon circulation, heat waves, extreme rainfall, tornadoes, and severe air pollution. Recent Findings Aerosols could participate in the development of meteorological systems through direct and indirect effects. Large-scale precipitation from shallow stratiform clouds was found to be suppressed by aerosols, while invigoration effects contribute to deep convection and even catastrophic floods in local areas. The occurrence of high-impact weather such as tornadoes and tropical cyclone is also related to aerosol concentration and distribution. Moreover, a positive feedback between aerosols and boundary layer meteorology is proposed as an important factor conducive to heavy haze pollution over urban areas. The work underscores the great importance of aerosols' meteorological feedback in extreme weather events. Integrated observations and seamless coupling of meteorology and atmospheric chemistry in models are highlighted for future studies to fill the knowledge gap in current research.

J	Jones, EC; Ong, C; Haynes, J				Jones, Eric C.; Ong, Corinne; Haynes, Jessica			Disaster-Related Food Security and Past General Governance Strategies in a Worldwide Sample	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Social Science; Drought; Flood events; Freeze events	COLLECTIVE ACTION; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; EVOLUTION; SOCIETIES; RECOVERY; TRENDS	Climate change is an increasingly pressing concern because it generates individual and societal vulnerability in many places in the world and also because it potentially threatens political stability. Aside from sea level rise, climate change is typically manifested in local temperature and precipitation extremes that generate other hazards. In this study, we investigated whether certain kinds of governance strategies were more common in societies whose food supply had been threatened by such natural hazards-specifically, floods, droughts, and locust infestations. We coded and analyzed ethnographic data from the Human Relations Area Files on 26 societies regarding dominant political, economic, and ideological behaviors of leaders in each society for a specified time period. Leaders in societies experiencing food-destroying disasters used different political economic strategies for maintaining power than did leaders in societies that face fewer disasters or that did not face such disasters. In nondisaster settings, leaders were more likely to have inward-focused cosmological and collectivistic strategies; conversely, when a society had experienced food-destroying disasters, leaders were more likely to have exclusionary tribal/family-based and externally focused strategies. This apparent difficulty in maintaining order and coherence of leadership in disaster settings may apply more to politically complex societies than to polities governed solely at the community level. Alternatively, it could be that exclusionary leaders help set up the conditions for disastrous consequences of hazards for the populace. Exceptions to the pattern of exclusionary political economic strategies in disaster settings indicate that workarounds do exist that allow leaders with corporate governance approaches to stay in power.

This study investigates annual streamflow volume trends in a newly assembled, consolidated, and validated data set of daily mean river flow records from more than 3000 stations which cover near-natural basins in more than 40 countries across Europe. Although the data set contains streamflow time series from 1900 to 2013 in some stations, the statistical analyses were carried out by including observations from 1950 to 2013 in order to have a consistent and reliable data set over the continent. Trends were detected by calculating the slope of the Theil-Sen line over the annual anomalies of streamflow volume. The results show that annual streamflow volume trends have emerged at European scale, with a marked negative tendency in Mediterranean regions, with about -1 x 10(3) m(3)/(km(2) yr(-2)), and a generally positive trend in northern ones, with about 0.5 x 10(3) m(3)/(km(-2) yr(-2)). The annual streamflow volume trend patterns appear to be in agreement with the continental-scale meteorological observations in response to climate change drivers. In the Mediterranean area, the decline of annual streamflow volumes started in 1965, and since the early 1980s, volumes have consistently been lower than the 1950-2013 average. The spatiotemporal annual streamflow volume patterns observed in this work can help to contextualize short-term trends and regional studies already available in the scientific literature, as well as to provide a valid benchmark for further accurate quantitative analysis of annual streamflow volumes.

Routed from northern Gilgit and flowing to the plains, the river passes through several provinces and is connected by numerous small and large tributaries. The river was formed tectonically due to the collusion of the Indian and Eurasian plates, which is referred to as the Indus suture Plains zone (ISPZ). The geological setting of the study area is mainly composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks. The river passed through a variety of climatic zones and areas, although the predominant climate is subtropic arid and sub arid to subequatorial. Locally and globally, anthropogenic activities such as building, dams, and water canals for irrigation purposes, mining exploration, and industries and factories all affected the physical and chemical behaviors of the sediments in various rivers. The main effect of human activities is the reworking of weathered soil smectite, a chemical weathering indicator that rises in the offshore record about 5000 years ago. This material indicates increased transport of stronger chemically weathered material, which may result from agriculture-induced erosion of older soil. However, we also see evidence for the incision of large rivers into the floodplain, which is also driving the reworking of this type of material, so the signal may be a combination of the two. Sediments undergo significant changes in form and size due to clashing with one another in the high-charge river.

To effectively handle these floods, an appropriate design of the urban drainage system (UDS) is highly important as its function can significantly influence the flooding severity and distribution. In recent years, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been increasingly used to design UDS due to their great ability in identifying optimal solutions. However, low computational efficiency and low solution practicality (i.e. the final solutions do not satisfy the design criteria) are major challenges for the majority of EA-based methods. To this end, this paper proposes an improved ant colony optimization (ACO, a typical type of EAs) based method to enhance the UDS design effectiveness, where the optimization efficiency is enhanced by initializing the ACO using an approximate design solution identified by the engineering design method, and the solution practicality is improved by explicitly accounting for the design criteria within the optimization using a proposed sampling method. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated using two real-world UDSs with different system complexities. Results show that the proposed method can identify design solutions with significantly improved efficiency and solution practicality compared to the traditional design approach, with advantages being more prominent for larger UDS design problems. The proposed method can be used by researchers/ practitioners to explore and develop better understanding of the UDS design alternatives under various challenges of climate change and rapid urbanization.

Desiree			Impact of recent climate extremes on mosquito-borne disease transmission in Kenya	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							DENGUE-FEVER; AEDES-AEGYPTI; DYNAMICS; DIPTERA; TEMPERATURE; CHILDREN; BURDEN	Climate change and variability influence temperature and rainfall, which impact vector abundance and the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Freshwater availability and temperature affect dengue vector populations via a variety of biological processes and thus influence the ability of mosquitoes to effectively transmit disease. However, the effect of droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold waves is not well understood. Using vector, climate, and dengue disease data collected between 2013 and 2019 in Kenya, this retrospective cohort study aims to elucidate the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of arboviral infections. To define extreme periods of rainfall and land surface temperature (LST), we calculated monthly anomalies as deviations from long-term means (1983-2019 for rainfall, 2000-2019 for LST) across four study locations in Kenya. We classified extreme climate events as the upper and lower 10% of these calculated LST or rainfall deviations. Monthly Ae. aegypti abundance was recorded in Kenya using four trapping methods. Blood samples were also collected from children with febrile illness presenting to four field sites and tested for dengue virus using an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that mosquito eggs and adults were significantly more abundant one month following an abnormally wet month. The relationship between mosquito abundance and dengue risk follows a non-linear association. Our findings suggest that early warnings and targeted interventions during periods of abnormal rainfall and temperature, especially flooding, can potentially contribute to reductions in risk of viral transmission.

The exposed high-energy South African coastline restricts mangroves to 32 sheltered estuaries of which 18 (56%) are predominantly open to the sea. A large area of mangrove (47% of the country total) occurs in the uMhlathuze Estuary - a novel ecosystem formed by the creation of an artificial mouth. A Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) framework was applied to understand factors of change and highlight governance and management responses. The largest mangrove area (440 ha) was lost during the construction of Durban Bay harbour. Mangroves (similar to 7 ha) no longer occur in 10 small KwaZulu-Natal estuaries as a result of catchment and mouth disturbance. In the Eastern Cape, pressures are escalating in the form of harvesting for wood, cattle browsing and changes in mouth condition. Climate related warming and an increase in CO2 are positive conditions for mangroves to expand their distribution to higher latitudes but this will depend on propagule dispersal between estuaries and the availability of suitable habitats. Many of the small estuaries are temporarily closed to the sea for different periods thus limiting recruitment. An increase in the intensity of freshwater floods will scour banks and completely remove mangroves. It is important that these dynamic responses are understood and incorporated into management plans so that mangrove forests can be better protected and conserved.

The role of land abandonment in modifying disturbance regimes has been highlighted for some types of disturbances, albeit being still somewhat overlooked compared to climate change. Objectives This literature review is aimed at highlighting the most relevant effects of land abandonment and land-use legacy on the regime of different types of forest disturbances, providing insight into land-use change/disturbances interactions. Methods We searched in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant studies at the global scale dealing with eight major natural disturbances: avalanche, flooding, herbivory, insect outbreak, landslide, rockfall, wildfire and windthrow. We classified papers into five relevance classes, with the highest score (4) assigned to studies quantitatively measuring the interactions between abandonment dynamics and disturbance regimes. Results Most papers focused on wildfires in Mediterranean Europe in the twentieth century, where landscape homogenisation and fuel build-up contributed to worsening their frequency, size and severity. Dense forests developed following land abandonment instead exert inhibiting effects toward mass movements such as avalanches, rockfalls and landslides. Regarding the other investigated disturbances, we found only a few studies presenting site-specific and partly contrasting effects. Conclusions Land abandonment triggers ecological processes at the landscape scale, altering land cover patterns and vegetation communities, which in turn affect disturbance regimes. Implications for land and resource management mostly depend on the stage at which post-abandonment secondary succession has developed.

A declining trend in aquifer levels and low-land spring flows has been observed for the past decades. 2 Study Focus: The aim of this study is to identify and analyse natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the Wairau Aquifer. Concurrent trends in the long-term water balance components for the Wairau catchment and in low-flow statistics as well as the correlation between hydro-meteorological drivers and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) index were investigated. The impact of river morphology changes on river recharge rates was studied using a previously developed groundwater flow model. 3 New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Our study found that long-term trends in declining catchment-scale precipitation are superimposed on climate oscillation and a strong annual variability. Jointly, these processes have resulted in lower than average river flows, increased low-flow periods, and consequently in lower rates of aquifer recharge. River engineering caused erosion of the braided river morphology, leading to a possibly permanent loss of aquifer storage. Groundwater abstraction is not accurately known which is a limitation of this study. This additional information and adaptation strategies are required for sustainable management of the groundwater resources.

This study aims to give insight into the changing climatic patterns leading to severe flood and drought conditions in the interior of Punjab province of Pakistan and devise adaptation strategies for risk governance. Landsat TM 30 m imagery was processed for flood analysis, while for drought analysis, Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) were calculated from MODIS (MOD11A2 and MOD13A2) imageries. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to prepare a management plan based on views of experts and local communities. The main regions affected by extreme events (flood and drought) in interior Punjab were Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Mianwali, Multan, Sargodha, and Rahim Yar Khan. Supervised classification shows flooding in the Mianwali district during August 2010, and TVDI values show that drought prevailed during the year 2000 in the Bahawalpur district. Annual precipitation showed a significant trend in Sargodha and Mianwali with the magnitude of 6.95 mm/year and 2.97 mm/year, respectively. However, SPI moves to positive in the case of all studied districts except Sargodha where temperature change is 0.6 degrees C. Climatic analysis and survey show that the people of districts, i.e., Faisalabad, Mianwali, Multan, and Sargodha, were more affected by floods, whereas the people of districts, i.e., Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan, were affected by both flood and drought. Adaptation strategies suggest that the flood water should be conserved which can help farmers in irrigation throughout the year.

Drivers of regional soil water storage memory and persistence	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MOISTURE MEMORY; HIGH-RESOLUTION; MODEL; DROUGHT; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; CARBON	Soil water storage dynamics link landscape and climate processes with consequent impacts on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, and on ecosystem functions. We explore regional-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics of root-zone soil water storage using spatially explicit, long-term simulations from a land data assimilation system over an area of similar to 2 million km(2) in the U.S. Midwest. We synthesize the dataset to examine spatial patterns of hydroclimatic forcing and soil and vegetation properties to identify the key drivers of soil water storage across the region. To identify differences in temporal hydrologic variability between sites with different soil and vegetation characteristics, we focus on daily data from 10 locations, representative of three major land cover types in the region. We use the concepts of (a) soil water memory to evaluate differences in landscape buffering of rainfall and (b) persistence to evaluate the threshold-crossing properties of statistically defined "wet" and "dry" soil water conditions. Power spectral analyses of soil water storage reveal that regionally consistent patterns emerge in memory at multiple temporal scales. Threshold-crossing analyses reveal corresponding similarity in persistence between sites. The analyses show that stochastic rainfall is the key driver of landscape hydrologic dynamics, with rainfall frequency as the primary determinant of persistence across the region, whereas differences in land cover and soil properties across the region have second-order influence. The synthesis approach we present here is useful for ecological and agricultural risk assessments of climate change impacts, including increasing frequency of extreme events such as droughts and floods, but primarily points to the need for better understanding of future precipitation changes.

Factors in household decisions for or against relocation from a flood risk area	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Planned relocation; Climate change; Flooding; Place identity; Resettlement	POPULATION DISPLACEMENT; PLACE ATTACHMENT; MANAGED RETREAT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESETTLEMENT; MODEL; RESILIENCE; RECOVERY; JUSTICE	Planned relocation may permanently reduce exposure to natural hazards; however, residents in designated relocation zones are confronted with a broad array of challenges and face profound changes in their everyday lives. The present study empirically illustrates how economic, emotional, risk and social dimensions underpin household decisions to accept or decline a home buyout offer in a voluntary relocation program in the Eferding Basin, Austria. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 79 households living in the relocation zone, transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. Risk appraisal and financial feasibility of moving to a new home function as entry points to the decision process. Risk perception is strongly influenced by biographical experiences, traumatic memories, and personal resources to cope with a flood event. Economic reasons are judged in the light of the children's future prospects. Fear and uncertainty about future floods as well as a personal bond to the place are critical emotional factors. By contrast, social relationships play a marginal role because those who leave tend to resettle close-by, and because solitude and autonomy are valued higher than neighborhood networks. Status as a long-term resident, newcomer or elderly person shifts the importance of specific factors, for instance, self-efficacy beliefs or intergenerational considerations. In order to facilitate relocation program implementation, compensation payments should be complemented by communication efforts addressing the emotional and risk dimensions. Communication activities should address those who leave as well as to those who stay and should be tailored to individual needs and resources of residents.

The Peace-Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta, Canada, is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance reliant on episodic river ice-jam flood events to recharge abundant perched lakes and wetlands. Improved and systematic monitoring of landscape-scale hydrological connectivity among freshwater ecosystems (rivers, channels, wetlands, and lakes) is needed to guide stewardship decisions in the face of climate change and upstream industrial development. Here, we use water isotope compositions, supplemented by measurements of specific conductivity and field observations, from 68 lakes and 9 river sites in May 2018 to delineate the extent and magnitude of spring ice-jam induced flooding along the Peace and Athabasca rivers. Lake-specific estimates of input water isotope composition (delta(I)) were modelled after accounting for influence of evaporative isotopic enrichment. Then, using the distinct isotopic signature of input water sources, we develop a set of binary mixing models and estimate the proportion of input to flooded lakes attributable to river floodwater and precipitation (snow or rain). This approach allowed identification of areas and magnitude of flooding that were not captured by other methods, including direct observations from flyovers, and to demarcate flow pathways in the delta. We demonstrate water isotope tracers as an efficient and effective monitoring tool for delineating spatial extent and magnitude of an important hydrological process and elucidating connectivity in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, an approach that can be readily adopted at other floodplain landscapes.

A.; Sasaki, Jun; Matsuda, Hirotaka; Fukunaga, Mayumi			Severe salinity contamination in drinking water and associated human health hazards increase migration risk in the southwestern coastal part of Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Socioeconomic vulnerability; Groundwater salinization; Potable water shortage; Health diseases; Human migration	VULNERABILITY; PERCEPTION	Bangladesh is a deltaic country and is highly vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise. This study explores population migration risk in relation to communal crisis due to socioeconomic vulnerability, drinking water scarcity, and health threats caused by salinity hazards. For this, we conducted a household questionnaire survey as well as, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. To identify the drinking water salinity and migration risk, our theoretical process hypothesizes a new composite indexing approach. Salinity hazards and potable water crises have increased the spread of human diseases and treatment costs, while socioeconomic crisis and poverty are inseparable risks of coastal communities because of frequent cyclone hits. Recently, salinity hazards have added a new dimension to health insecurities and household financial instability. Results showed a high migration risk in the unions of Gabura, Munshigonj, Atulia, Burigoaliny, and Padmapukur (from highest risk to lowest), as these areas exhibit worsening situations with respect to drinking water scarcity, salinity hazards, and health hazards, and their adaptive capacities are significantly low. Furthermore, socioeconomic vulnerabilities to cyclone hits, salinity hazards, and severe drinking water scarcity may soon contribute to increased population migration in response to climate change, sea level rise, and the associated impacts of these trends. To tackle the future mass population migration problem, urgent action is required to improve socioeconomic conditions, and provide alternative sources of potable water and health care facilities. Hard and soft measures must be ensured to reconstruct vulnerable areas impacted by riverbank erosion, flooding, and waterlogging. Additionally, action should be taken to enhance local awareness of coastal disasters, their associated hazardous consequences, and possible mitigation and adaptation measures.	[Rakib, M.

The surveys provided data on lake depths and other parameters characterising the three-dimensional lake geometry, and bathymetrically derived lake volumes. The sample included 21 glacier-connected lakes, 27 lakes formed on the young moraines without glacier-connected with glacier tongue, eight lakes formed on the older moraines and one rock-dammed lake. The lakes' volumes ranged between 0.029x10(5) and 53.89x10(5) m(3) with the largest value of mean depth was 23 m. There is a statistically significant correlation between lake depth and width, length and area, best approximated by the power, linear, and polynomial models, with coefficients of determination ranging between 0.50 and 0.78 for the glacier-connected lakes. The power equations underestimated both depths and volumes of larger lakes but the second-order polynomial model provided a closer approximation in the study region. The obtained data were combined with the bathymetrically derived depth and volume data published in the literature extending the global data set of bathymetries of lakes with natural dams. The area-depth scaling equations derived from the combined data set showed a considerable improvement in correlation between area and depth in comparison with the earlier studies. The measured bathymetries of the glacier-connected lakes were compared with bathymetries of the same lakes simulated using GlabTOP2 model and published simulated ice thickness data. There is generally a good agreement between the measured and simulated bathymetries although GlabTOP2 tends to overestimate lake depths. The data from the bathymetric surveys and GlabTOP2 model are used by the practitioners to reduce and avoid risks associated with glacier lake outburst floods and are important instruments of the regional strategy of adaptation to climate change.

Effects of flood-associated stressors on growth and survival of early life stage oysters (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Oyster reef; Water quality; Crassostrea virginica; Flooding; Environmental tolerance	HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; HORIZON OIL-SPILL; EASTERN OYSTER; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; REEF RESTORATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; BIVALVE MOLLUSKS; HYPOXIA; MORTALITY	Oyster reefs provide essential ecosystem services but are severely degraded worldwide. Extreme flooding events, which can be intensified by water management decisions, reduce water quality in estuaries and further threaten oyster populations. Restoration and conservation of oysters is dependent on the success of early oyster life stages. This study examined the effect of water quality stressors associated with flooding events on the growth and survival of larval and juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). In 96-h assays, we exposed D-stage larvae to a range of dissolved oxygen, microcystin-LR, pH, and salinity concentrations. These conditions were selected based on water quality data from the Mississippi Sound during a 2019 freshwater flooding event caused by the Bonnet Carre Spillway opening. There was no negative effect of microcystin-LR or pH on early veligers at the concentrations tested, but low salinity significantly reduced shell growth, and hypoxia (< 2 mg L-1 O-2) decreased both larval growth and survival. Post-metamorphosis juvenile oysters were exposed to the same water quality stressors for 24 days in the lab. Low DO, pH, and salinity treatments reduced juvenile change in wet weight and shell growth rates, but had no effects on survival. These laboratory-exposed juveniles were subsequently deployed into the field to assess the ability of juveniles to recover from short-term exposure to simulated flooding-associated stressors. After deployment to natural conditions in the Mississippi Sound, juvenile oysters were able to compensate for reduced growth during the lab exposure, even though survival was reduced for juveniles previously exposed to low pH during the first two weeks in the field. In general, early oyster life stages were relatively tolerant of the duration and stressor concentrations tested, but negative sublethal impacts of flood-associated stressors must be considered in the face of increasing frequency and duration of flooding events due to climate change.

In this study, we demonstrate that isotopic mass balance modelling can be used to provide evidence of the relative importance of direct floodwater inputs and temporary subsurface storage of floodwater at ungauged lake systems. A volume-dependent transient isotopic mass balance model was developed for an artificial lake (named lake A) in southern Quebec (Canada). This lake typically receives substantial floodwater inputs during the spring freshet period as an ephemeral hydraulic connection with a 150 000 km(2) large watershed is established. First-order water flux estimates to lake A allow for impacts of floodwater inputs to be highlighted within the annual water budget. The isotopic mass balance model has revealed that groundwater and surface water inputs account for 60 %-71% and 39 %-28% of the total annual water inputs to lake A, respectively, which demonstrates an inherent dependence of the lake on groundwater. However, when considering the potential temporary subsurface storage of floodwater, the partitioning between groundwater and surface water inputs tends to equalize, and the lake A water budget is found to be more resilient to groundwater quantity and quality changes. Our findings suggest not only that floodwater fluxes to lake A have an impact on its dynamics during springtime but also significantly influence its long-term water balance and help to inform, understand, and predict future water quality variations. From a global perspective, this knowledge is useful for establishing regional-scale management strategies for maintaining water quality at flood-affected lakes, for predicting the response of artificial recharge systems in such settings, and for mitigating impacts due to land use and climate changes.

However, the potential effects of persistent drought and waterlogging on the dynamics of the NSCs and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Methods: We measured the NSCs concentrations and pool size, photosynthetic rate and biomass of Robinia pseudoacacia L. seedlings for both 2015 and 2016 under five soil water treatments: 3%, 8%, 17%, 24% and 34% soil water content, representing extreme drought (ED), moderate drought (MD), the control group (CG), field capacity (FC) and waterlogging (WL) stresses, respectively. We observed the relationship between the pool size of NSCs and the survival of seedlings under water stress (drought and waterlogging) for 30 days in greenhouse. Results: Compared with CG, the net photosynthetic rate decreased 91%, 67%, 34% and 71%, and the biomass decreased by 37%, 15%, 16% and 33% under ED, MD, FC and WL, respectively. The total NSC (TNSC) concentration was significantly increased by 154% under ED after 10days and sharply decreased by 50% under ED after 30days. The concentrations of soluble sugars (SS) were significantly increased by 100% under MD after 10days and sharply decreased by 60% under ED after 30days. Compared with GC, the response of NSCs, photosynthetic rate and biomass under ED were more dramatic than that under WL. The pool sizes of fructose and sucrose were larger under ED and WL, but the maximum pool size of starch occurred under the CG. The depletion of NSCs was not observed under ED at the end of the experiments in both 2015 and 2016. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the dynamics of NSCs is an important physiological feature of plant adaptation and resistance to drought and waterlogging. In addition, high sugars concentrations are beneficial for the plants during the short-term extreme drought and the longer term mild drought or waterlogging.

Flow magnitude and timing during the year were investigated in this study. Observations from 11 unregulated rivers in northern Sweden were analysed, using extreme-value distributions with time-dependent parameters. The Mann-Kendall test was used to investigate possible trends. The extreme-value statistics revealed no significant trends for the stations considered, but the Mann-Kendall test showed a significant upward trend for some stations. For timing of maximum flow (day of the year), the Mann-Kendall test revealed significant downward trends for two stations (with the longest records). This implies that the day of the maximum flow is occurring earlier in the year in northern Sweden.

To this end, standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) were projected under (representative concentration pathway) RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas scenarios. In general, our results show that Ankara experienced six severe and two extreme drought events during the reference period, 1971-2000. However, the projections indicate fewer drought events for the near-future period of 2016-2040, with no potential extreme drought events. While the RCP4.5 scenario showed that dry spells will be dominant in the second half of the near-future period, the RCP8.5 scenario projected that dry spells will be evenly distributed during the entire near-future period.

However, evidence from small islands in central Philippines experiencing frequent tidal flooding shows that in-situ adaptation can help enable mass migration by reducing vulnerability and increasing the resources needed for successful relocation. Using ecosystem-based adaptation, the island communities are able to increase their resilience to disasters, which could otherwise drive sudden and unplanned relocation. Using community-based adaptation or no regrets strategies such as education and vocational skills training, the younger generation of residents will be better able to find more mainland-based job opportunities, potentially enabling the natural depopulation of the island in the future.

J	Bernabé-Crespo, MB; Cantos, JO; Cañizares, AO				Bernabe-Crespo, Miguel B.; Cantos, Jorge Olcina; Canizares, Antonio Oliva			Proposal of the "Wastewater Use Basin" Concept as an Integrated Sewage and Rainwater Management Unit in Semiarid Regions-A Case Study in the Southeast of the Iberian Peninsula	WATER			English	Article						sewage; rainwater; environmental tanks; climate change; drought	PUBLIC ACCEPTABILITY; FUTURE SCENARIOS; REUSE; ACCEPTANCE; TRENDS	Semi-arid and arid regions are characterized by their water scarcity, which leads territories to seek ways of increasing the water resources available to meet their demands (urban, agricultural, industrial, leisure and tourism, etc.). For this reason, this article proposes the term "wastewater use basin"; the concept of the "wastewater use basin" is presented as a working unit of a smaller scale than traditional river basins, which allows for a better management of the water collected in the sewerage network and rainwater of urban agglomerations. It is a geographically-focused proposal for the integrated management of wastewater and stormwater that ends up in a wastewater treatment plant for treatment and reuse. The study area is located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain; specifically, the Campo of Cartagena-Mar Menor district (Murcia) and Vega Baja district (Alicante). The results show the trend behaviour of rainfall in the Segura river basin in recent episodes of torrential rainfall. There is a clear tendency for these episodes to occur in the coastal and pre-coastal areas, so that the water does not reach the headwaters where the reservoirs are located. For this reason, the proposed concept includes the area of the basin that would be formed by the wastewater and rainwater collectors which, in short, are intended to be treated in a treatment plant for subsequent reuse. The calculations made on the basis of the capacity of the environmental tanks executed and projected amount to four cubic hectometers which could be added to the hydrological planning of the Segura basin. In conclusion, the collection of rainwater allows the incorporation of an additional volume of water that complements and increases the resources offered by the treatment plants in the hydrological planning. It also serves as a measure of adaptation to climatic extremes (droughts and floods) and to the effects of climate change, supporting a circular management of the use of resources.

A significant increase in water use and consumption (due to the intensification of construction, industry, tourism, and militarization), along with the cessation of fresh water supplies from mainland Ukraine, has reduced the water levels in some reservoirs to critical levels, and climate change has exacerbated this situation. There has been a significant decrease in precipitation by 10-15% on the Crimean Peninsula, accompanied by an increase in surface temperature by 0.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C per 10 years during the period 1991-2020. The analysis of satellite-driven drought severity index reveals that the vast area of Crimean steppe is exposed to moderate-high drought risk. According to Landsat satellite imagery, there is a decreasing tendency for the water mirror area of all reservoirs, with a decrease of 34% on average in 2021 compared to 2015. The retrospective analysis of satellite images for 2015-2021 showed that the water surface area of the Simferopol reservoir had decreased on average by similar to 20% compared to 2015. To solve the problems associated with the shortage of fresh water, a series of works on the active influences on atmospheric processes was conducted, aimed at providing additional artificial precipitation. Two situations were considered, with mixed results: In the first case, on 30 October 2016, wet soil and standing water areas were detected by radar satellite imagery in agricultural fields within a radius of 40 km of the village of Petrovka, Krasnogvardiiskyi district, potentially related to the induction of precipitation by active influences on atmosphere. Meanwhile, in the second case, the realization of atmospheric precipitation occurred over Simferopol on 29-30 September 2020, leading to flooding in the city, but an increase in the water surface area of the Simferopol reservoir after active influences was not recorded.

Seawater inundation, one of the most serious disasters, could damage human property and life. Regional sea level rise, highest astronomic tide, vertical land motions, and extreme sea level could result in episodic, recurrent, or permanent coastal inundation. Therefore, assessing potential flooding areas is a critical task for coastal management plans. In this study, a simulation of the static flooding situation in the southwest coast of Taiwan (Tainan city) at the end of this century was conducted by using a combination of the Taiwan Digital Elevation Model (DEM), regional sea level changes reconstructed by tide gauge and altimetry data, vertical land deformation derived from leveling and GPS data, and ocean tide models. In addition, the extreme sea level situation, which typically results from high water on a spring tide and a storm surge, was also evaluated by the joint probability method using tide gauge records. To analyze the possible static flood risk and avoid overestimation of inundation areas, a region-based image segmentation method was employed in the estimated future topographic data to generate the flood risk map. In addition, an extreme sea level situation, which typically results from high water on a spring tide and a storm surge, was also evaluated by the joint probability method using tide gauge records. Results showed that the range of inundation depth around the Tainan area is 0-8 m with a mean value of 4 m. In addition, most of the inundation areas are agricultural land use (60% of total inundation area of Tainan), and two important international wetlands, 88.5% of Zengwun Estuary Wetlands and 99.5% of Sihcao Wetlands (the important Black-faced Spoonbills Refuge) will disappear under the combined situation. The risk assessment of flooding areas is potentially useful for coastal ocean and land management to develop appropriate adaptation policies for preventing disasters resulting from global climate change.

New regulations reinforcing the industry's responsibilities beyond operational costs, coupled with continued range expansion and establishment of new LAS will increase damages. To tackle LAS effectively, the water industry requires reliable information about which species pose the greatest risk to operations and which areas are most vulnerable to invasion. Here we assess potential biosecurity threats for the 24 water companies in the UK using well-established modelling research techniques such as risk assessment and distribution modelling. Using a consensus approach with environmental managers and water companies, we identified 11 LAS of concern for the UK water industry, including five plants, three crustaceans, two molluscs and one fish. These invaders pose important hazards in terms of water quality, flood protection, human health, integrity of infrastructures, recreational and aesthetic values, amongst others. We used distribution models to predict their potential expansion under current and future 2050 climate scenarios within each of the 24 water companies in the UK. Water companies in the South East of England (Cambridge Water, Anglian Water, Affinity Water and Thames Water) are under the highest risk of invasional meltdown from multiple LAS, both now and under future scenarios. The quagga mussel poses the most serious risk of immediate spread and may exacerbate the impacts of the widespread zebra mussel for the water industry. The information generated in this study can support the prioritization of species and regions at risk, so that funds for prevention and eradication of invasions are well allocated. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that scientific risk assessments, usually restricted to the academic and public sectors, can be extremely useful to guide decision-making by the private sector.

The Case of Genoa	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						resilience; territorial security; urban planning; risk mitigation; stakeholder participation	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN RESILIENCE; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; INNOVATION; LESSONS	This paper analyzes some natural and man-made disasters that happened in recent years, which demonstrate how the resilience of a city does not depend only on the actions carried out by public authorities, but it requires the joint work of all actors that live or work in a city. Resilience represents the ability of an urban system to adapt to an external event and quickly return to normality. In recent years, urban resilience has mainly addressed natural risks, neglecting man-made disaster. Therefore, this study considers the risk issue in relation to the resilience concept within urban planning and policies to achieve sustainability and urban security. Urban resilience has become an important objective for cities, particularly to face climate change. The paper proposes a review of the existing Civil Protection Urban Emergency Plan, as a sector plan to support urban planning at the local level, aimed at building resilience in cities. In particular, the proposed Emergency Plan reduces risk and increases resilience by identifying specific scenarios and actions that every city actor-public authorities, research, enterprises, and citizens-can implement. This proposal contributes to the implementation of the quadruple helix principle, according to which the involvement of these four actors is necessary to achieve a common goal, such as increasing urban resilience. The proposed methodology is then applied to the man-made disasters that have involved the city (such as the flood of 2011 and the collapse of the Morandi Bridge in 2018). Genoa represents a good example to be studied according to the "learning-by-doing" approach to understand how the city has responded, adapting resiliently, to natural and man-made events thanks to the collaboration of all the actors above mentioned. The new scenarios, included in the Urban Emergency Plan, can play a fundamental role, both in the emergency and prevention phase, and can help other cities around the world in planning more resilient cities to face higher risks.

It is expressed in the redistribution of runoff within a year: an increase in minimum runoff and a decrease in flood runoff. The analysis of the series of the inflow to the Moskvoretskaya system reservoirs revealed stationarity disturbances in the studied series for the period of 1978-1980. This was followed by a change in the characteristics of runoff regulation carried out for water supply in the Moscow region. It is shown that the inflow changes led to the statistical heterogeneity of the series of regulation characteristics, including the total live storage and water deficiency. The Bayesian method is proposed for obtaining statistical characteristics of nonstationary series of the inflow and yield of the Moskvoretskaya system reservoirs.	[Bolgov, M. V.; Filippova, I.

If the risk of flood disasters under climate and land-use changes can be predicted and evaluated, it will be conducive to flood control, disaster reduction, and global sustainable development. This study uses bias correction and spatial downscaling (BCSD), patch-generating land-use simulation (PLUS) coupled with multi-objective optimization (MOP), and entropy weighting to construct a 1 km resolution flood risk assessment framework for the Guanzhong Plain under multiple future scenarios. The results of this study show that BCSD can process the 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data well, with a correlation coefficient of up to 0.98, and that the Kappa coefficient is 0.85. Under the SSP126 scenario, the change in land use from cultivated land to forest land, urban land, and water bodies remained unchanged. In 2030, the proportion of high-risk and medium-risk flood disasters in Guanzhong Plain will be 41.5% and 43.5% respectively. From 2030 to 2040, the largest changes in risk areas were in medium- and high-risk areas. The medium-risk area decreased by 1256.448 km2 (6.4%), and the high-risk area increased by 1197.552 km2 (6.1%). The increase mainly came from the transition from the medium-risk area to the high-risk area. The most significant change in the risk area from 2040 to 2050 is the higher-risk area, which increased by 337 km2 (5.7%), while the medium- and high-risk areas decreased by 726.384 km2 (3.7%) and 667.488 km2 (3.4%), respectively. Under the SSP245 scenario, land use changes from other land use to urban land use; the spatial distribution of the overall flood risk and the overall flood risk of the SSP126 and SSP245 scenarios are similar. The central and western regions of the Guanzhong Plain are prone to future floods, and the high-wind areas are mainly distributed along the Weihe River. In general, the flood risk in the Guanzhong Plain increases, and the research results have guiding significance for flood control in Guanzhong and global plain areas.

Extreme events in biological, societal, and earth sciences: A systematic review of the literature	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Review						climate change; natural hazard; human health; prehistory; vulnerability; risk; resilience; abrupt	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT WAVES; HEALTH IMPACTS; EARLY HOLOCENE; UNITED-STATES; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; VULNERABILITY; FRAMEWORK; MORTALITY	The term "extreme event " is commonly used to describe high-impact, unanticipated natural events, like floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. It first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1950s and has since spread to disciplines as diverse as economics, psychology, medicine, and engineering. The term is increasingly being applied to the study of historical, prehistorical, and deep-time events across a broad range of scales, and it is widely acknowledged that such events have had profound impacts on the Earth's biodiversity and cultures. Understandably, then, how people think about, define, and study extreme events varies considerably. With extreme events expected to become more frequent, longer lasting, and more intense in the coming decades as a result of global warming, the differing extreme event definitions-both across and within disciplines-is likely to lead to confusion among researchers and pose significant challenges for predicting and preparing for extreme events and their impacts on natural and social systems. With this in mind, we conducted a systematic quantitative review of 200 randomly selected, peer-reviewed "extreme event " research papers (sourced from Web of Science, accessed January 2020) from the biological, societal, and earth sciences literature with the aim of quantifying several pertinent features of the research sample. On the one hand, our analysis found a great deal of variability among extreme event papers with respect to research interests, themes, concepts, and definitions. On the other hand, we found a number of key similarities in how researchers think about and study extreme events. One similarity we encountered was that researchers tend to view extreme events within a particular temporal context and quite often in terms of rates of change. Another similarity we encountered was that researchers often think of and study extreme events in terms of risks, vulnerabilities, and impacts. The similarities identified here may be useful in developing a common and comprehensive definition of what constitutes an extreme event, and should allow for more comparative research into extreme events at all spatio-temporal scales which, we predict, will provide important new insights into the nature of extreme events.

In many societies, a god is thought to be responsible for weather events. In some of those societies, a god is thought to cause harm with weather and/or can choose to help, such as by bringing needed rain. In other societies, gods are not thought to be involved with weather. Using a worldwide, largely nonindustrial sample of 46 societies with high gods, this research explores whether certain climate patterns predict the belief that high gods are involved with weather. Our major expectation, largely supported, was that such beliefs would most likely be found in drier climates. Cold extremes and hot extremes have little or no relationship to the beliefs that gods are associated with weather. Since previous research by Skoggard et al. showed that greater resource stress predicted the association of high gods with weather, we also tested mediation path models to help us evaluate whether resource stress might be the mediator explaining the significant associations between drier climates and high god beliefs. The climate variables, particularly those pertaining to dryness, continue to have robust relationships to god beliefs when controlling on resource stress; at best, resource stress has only a partial mediating effect. We speculate that drought causes humans more anxiety than floods, which may result in the greater need to believe supernatural beings are not only responsible for weather but can help humans in times of need. Significance Statement There has been a recent resurgence in climate-culture studies focusing on specific cultural effects of climate and avoiding the broad generalizations that had marred such studies in the past. Given accelerated climate change, it is especially important today to understand how climate change may influence human behavior and associated cultural beliefs and practices. We use anthropological data from the recent past to explore the relationships between climate patterns and culture. Here we focus on societal beliefs about godly involvement with weather. We find that there is a relationship between aridity or drought and high gods' involvement with weather, suggesting further exploration of linkages between climate and religious beliefs.

One of the understudied threats from damage caused by hurricanes is the potential for cross-contamination of water bodies with pathogens in coastal agricultural regions. Using microbiological data collected after hurricanes Florence and Michael, this study shows a dichotomy in the presence of pathogens in coastal North Carolina and Florida. Salmonella typhimurium was abundant in water samples collected in the regions dominated by swine farms. A drastic decrease in Enterococcus spp. in Carolinas is indicative of pathogen removal with flooding waters. Except for the abundance presence of Salmonella typhimurium, no significant changes in pathogens were observed after Hurricane Michael in the Florida panhandle. We argue that a comprehensive assessment of pathogens must be included in decision-making activities in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes to build resilience against risks of pathogenic exposure in rural agricultural and human populations in vulnerable locations.

Approaches to disaster response and recovery need to improve. This article uses four principles drawn from area-based approaches (ABAs) - people-centred responses, adaptive processes, multi-sector collaboration and reflective practice - to review urban disaster recovery efforts in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Information was gathered through key informant interviews and a literature review. The research found positive examples of collaboration, locally tailored social protection mechanisms and community leadership. It also found challenges, including bypassed community structures and traditional adaptation techniques, duplication of efforts and weak coordination. The article concludes with a call to localise ABA approaches further, to strengthen people-centred disaster recovery and locally owned resilience.

This research investigates how current contested relations between water, settlement patterns, and productive landscapes can be turned into a constructive interplay. This paper presents a water urbanism research project, which uses interpretative mapping and research by design to critically understand the evolution of the relationship between water and settlements in the peri-urban areas of Funza and Mosquera. The project develops landscape typologies for adaptation and mitigation in view of climate change and to address demands of urbanisation in the Bogota River floodplain. The paper demonstrates how designingwithwater can re-qualify the peripheral areas of Bogota, solving both qualitative and quantitative water issues, delivering a framework for new housing fabrics, and creating new sustainable relations between different water uses.

Higher probability of compound flooding from precipitation and storm surge in Europe under anthropogenic climate change	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; RIVER; DEPENDENCE; RAINFALL; COSTS	In low-lying coastal areas, the co-occurrence of high sea level and precipitation resulting in large runoff may cause compound flooding (CF). When the two hazards interact, the resulting impact can be worse than when they occur individually. Both storm surges and heavy precipitation, as well as their interplay, are likely to change in response to global warming. Despite the CF relevance, a comprehensive hazard assessment beyond individual locations is missing, and no studies have examined CF in the future. Analyzing co-occurring high sea level and heavy precipitation in Europe, we show that the Mediterranean coasts are experiencing the highest CF probability in the present. However, future climate projections show emerging high CF probability along parts of the northern European coast. In several European regions, CF should be considered as a potential hazard aggravating the risk caused by mean sea level rise in the future.

Household Level Evidence from Punjab	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES			English	Article							FOOD SECURITY; SAFETY NETS; ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM; BENEFIT INCIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POOR; IMPACT; ADOPTION; RISK; TECHNOLOGY	Empirical studies in different developing countries have investigated the impact of social protection (SP) on ex-post poverty; however, few studies analysed the impact of SP on ex-ante vulnerability to poverty (VtP). This paper contributes to the literature by evaluating the impact of SP on vulnerability to poverty (VtP) and poverty rates among households in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A hierarchical modelling approach is used to analyse the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS-2011) data of about 90,000 households. Matching methods and simultaneous endogenous switching regression are used to control for potential selection bias and estimate average treatment effects. Our results show that SP has a positive impact in reducing household poverty and VtP, but this impact is mainly driven by a short-term flood relief cash transfer programme, pension of government employees and households' regular purchase from utility store network.

There are clear and strong indicators of climate change reported for the Himalayas, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir region situated in the western Himalayas. In this study, using observational data, detailed characteristics of long- and short-term as well as localized variations in temperature and precipitation are analyzed for these six meteorological stations, namely, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Kokarnag, Qazigund, Kupwara and Srinagar during 1980-2016. All of these stations are located in Jammu and Kashmir, India. In addition to analysis of stations observations, we also utilized the dynamical downscaled simulations of WRF model and ERA-Interim (ERA-I) data for the study period. The annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation changes were analyzed by carrying out Mann-Kendall, linear regression, cumulative deviation and Student's t statistical tests. The results show an increase of 0.8 degrees C in average annual temperature over 37 years (from 1980 to 2016) with higher increase in maximum temperature (0.97 degrees C) compared to minimum temperature (0.76 degrees C). Analyses of annual mean temperature at all the stations reveal that the high-altitude stations of Pahalgam (1.13 degrees C) and Gulmarg (1.04 degrees C) exhibit a steep increase and statistically significant trends. The overall precipitation and temperature patterns in the valley show significant decreases and increases in the annual rainfall and temperature respectively. Seasonal analyses show significant increasing trends in the winter and spring temperatures at all stations, with prominent decreases in spring precipitation. In the present study, the observed long-term trends in temperature (degrees C year(-1)) and precipitation (mm year(-1)) along with their respective standard errors during 1980-2016 are as follows: (i) 0.05 (0.01) and -16.7 (6.3) for Gulmarg, (ii) 0.04 (0.01) and -6.6 (2.9) for Srinagar, (iii) 0.04 (0.01) and -0.69 (4.79) for Kokarnag, (iv) 0.04 (0.01) and -0.13 (3.95) for Pahalgam, (v) 0.034 (0.01) and -5.5 (3.6) for Kupwara, and (vi) 0.01 (0.01) and -7.96 (4.5) for Qazigund. The present study also reveals that variation in temperature and precipitation during winter (December-March) has a close association with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Further, the observed temperature data (monthly averaged data for 1980-2016) at all the stations show a good correlation of 0.86 with the results of WRF and therefore the model downscaled simulations are considered a valid scientific tool for the studies of climate change in this region. Though the correlation between WRF model and observed precipitation is significantly strong, the WRF model significantly underestimates the rainfall amount, which necessitates the need for the sensitivity study of the model using the various microphysical parameterization schemes. The potential vorticities in the upper troposphere are obtained from ERA-I over the Jammu and Kashmir region and indicate that the extreme weather event of September 2014 occurred due to breaking of intense atmospheric Rossby wave activity over Kashmir. As the wave could transport a large amount of water vapor from both the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and dump them over the Kashmir region through wave breaking, it probably resulted in the historical devastating flooding of the whole Kashmir valley in the first week of September 2014. This was accompanied by extreme rainfall events measuring more than 620 mm in some parts of the Pir Panjal range in the south Kashmir.

However, the evaluation of its condition is very different because of the various parameters and their inappropriate uses. The aim of this study was to determine the responses of the parameters of SS on the soil type and tillage system as the most important factors that influence it through changes in the soil organic matter and soil texture. The soil factor, which was represented by seven soil types (EF, Eutric Fluvisol; MF, Mollic Fluvisol; HC, Haplic Chernozem; HL, Haplic Luvisol; ER, Eutric Regosol; EG, Eutric Gleysol; DS, Distric Stagnosol), should be included in all evaluations of SS because of the specifics of each soil type. The tillage factor (shallow non-inversion-reduced, RT; deeper with inversion-conventional, CT) was chosen because of a high sensitivity of SS to soil disruption by cultivation, which represents high potential for the mitigation of climate change. The study included 126 sampling places in different parts of Slovakia on real farms (7 soil types x 3 localities x 3 crop rotations x 2 tillage systems x 2 soil depths). The soils were analysed for the aggregate fraction composition, particle size distribution, and parameters of organic carbon. The data of different parameters of SS were calculated and evaluated. The most sensitive parameter of the tested ones was the coefficient of structure (K-st), which manifested up to the level of the fractions of humus substances and indicated a better condition of SS in more productive soils than less productive soils. The coefficient of soil structure vulnerability (K-v) and mean weight diameter in water-resistant macroaggregates (MWDw) showed a worse condition of SS in the soils, which developed on Neogene sediments. A better condition of SS in RT was predicted particularly by the primary parameters (index of crusting, I-c; critical content of soil organic matter, S-t), and in CT, they were mainly the secondary parameters (K-st; water-resistant of soil aggregates, K-w). Overall, the suitability of the parameters of SS should be evaluated in relation to a specific soil type with its characteristics and should not be used universally.

The publications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report and Environment Agency's National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy (NFCERMS) for England have shown that extreme weather, including increased likelihood of high magnitude flood events, will occur and will require more novel management methods. This study focused on the ability of co-designed NFM measures to ameliorate downstream fluvial flooding by attenuating catchment response through a highly spatially distributed network of attenuating and roughening measures. Performance was characterised by the ability of NFM to attenuate flood peaks at different spatial scales across a large (187 km(2)) dendritic catchment, including the lowering of flood peaks and delaying the time-to-peak. Using a coupled modelling methodology and applying it to the upper Stour Valley, Warwickshire-Avon, UK, a rural response to the application of a set of NFM interventions was developed using the hydrodynamic model Flood Modeller Pro and XPSWMM(C). The method demonstrated a means of incorporating local knowledge in a realistic set of NFM schemes, tested to multiple flood risk scenarios (including climate change). Under frequent, smaller design storm events (e.g., Index Flood (QMED) and 3.3% AEP), flood peaks were lowered across all hydrological scales tested (5.8 km(2) to 187 km(2)). As the design flood event severity increases, impact from upstream NFM attenuation on downstream peak response diminished significantly, especially at the largest hydrological scales. However, even at the largest hydrological scale, delays in time-to-peak were noted, increasing the ability of downstream communities to respond and enact flood preparation activities, thus increasing resilience to potential flooding events. While the benefits were limited to large flood events, the modelling indicated that NFM has the potential to reduce downstream flood risk. However, greater integration of observed data to improve model confidence and reduce uncertainty in modelled events is needed, especially the uncertainty associated with using single peaked design storm events from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). This paper proposes a future Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) monitoring programme that could be integrated with models and applied across non-tidally influenced catchments seeking to empirically test the hydrological performance of in-situ NFM.

Changes in the characteristics of 'wet' and 'dry' Red Sea Trough over the Eastern Mediterranean in CMIP5 climate projections	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Active Red Sea Trough; Synoptic classification; Climate change; Eastern Mediterranean; Global warming; Middle East	DAILY SYNOPTIC SYSTEMS; EVENTS; CLASSIFICATION; DESERT; ISRAEL; FLOODS; STORMS; NEGEV; MODEL	The Eastern Mediterranean resides on the border between the temperate and semi-arid and arid climate zones, and is thus influenced by both mid-latitude and sub-tropical weather systems. Precipitation and extreme weather in this region are mainly associated with either Cyprus Lows or the "wet" Red Sea Troughs. Current regional climate projections indicate that the region may become warmer and drier in future decades. Here, we analyze the influence of enhanced greenhouse gas forcing on the climatological properties of the 'wet' and 'dry' Red Sea Trough (WRST & DRST, respectively). With this aim, a regional synoptic classification and a downscaling algorithm based on past analogs are applied to eighteen rain stations over the main ground water basins in Israel. The algorithms are applied to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for 1986-2005 and to eight CMIP5 model simulations for the historical (1986-2005) and end of the century (2081-2100) climate conditions according to the RCP8.5 scenario. For the historical period, the CMIP5 models are largely able to represent the characteristics of the Red Sea Trough. Based on the multi-model mean, significant changes are found for WRST and DRST for the late XXI Century. First, an increase in the meridional pressure gradient is found for both the WRST and the DRST, implying stronger horizontal winds. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the occurrence of the WRST (- 20%) and a significant increase in the frequency of the DRST (+ 19%) are identified. Accordingly, the persistence of the WRST decreases (- 9%), while for DRST increases (+ 9%). The decline in the frequency of WRST occurs primarily in the transition seasons, while the increase for DRST is found throughout the wet season. In total, the daily rainfall associated with the WRST system is projected to significantly decline (- 37%) by the end of the XXI century. These results document the projected changes in a dominant synoptic system in this area, which can facilitate a better estimation of the arising challenges, e.g., related to shortage of water resources and associated political unrest, reduced agricultural potential, and increased air pollution and forest fires. Such a pathway can ultimately foster novel mitigation strategies for water resources management and regional climate change adaptation.

Benefits of coastal managed realignment for society: Evidence from ecosystem service assessments in two UK regions	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Sediment accretion; Benefits transfer; Restoration; Recreation; Climate regulation; Agricultural production	SALT-MARSH; RAPID ASSESSMENT; NITROUS-OXIDE; CARBON; RESTORATION; ESTUARY; FISH; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; BALANCE	Coastal managed realignment has the potential to deliver both nature conservation and other benefits to people, but these are rarely quantified. We used an ecosystem services assessment toolkit, TESSA, at two locations in the UK; Hesketh Outmarsh West (northwest England), where realignment has already been carried out, and the Inner Firth of Forth (central Scotland), where realignment is proposed for multiple sites. At the Inner Forth we focus on one site, Inch of Ferryton, in Clackmannanshire but also assess ecosystem services across several sites. Using dedicated data collection where possible, and site appropriate existing data, we estimate the value of these sites to people in the realigned state compared with the most realistic alternative: continued agricultural production behind hard flood defences (agricultural state). Services assessed were climate change mitigation, agricultural production, nature-based recreation, and flood risk protection. At both sites agricultural production was estimated to be greater in the agricultural state, while other services were estimated to be greater in the realigned state. We are cautious about assigning overall monetary values based on biophysical attributes, particularly considering that climate change mitigation is highly sensitive to carbon prices, and that by necessity we were unable to quantify all services. Nevertheless, using a price for carbon that incorporates the societal cost of emissions, we estimate that the net annual provision of services is 262,935 (1460.75 pound/ha) at Hesketh Outmarsh West and 93,216 pound (574.70 pound/ha) at Inch of Ferryton. At both sites, sequestered carbon in accreting sediments outweighs greenhouse gas emissions from intertidal habitats, and the net value of this in turn outweighs the income foregone from crops and grazing. At Hesketh Outmarsh West the value of ecosystem services is increased by the reduction to flood risk arising from the coastal managed realignment action. Nature-based recreation is estimated to increase at both sites under realignment, with the visitor profile expected to be strongly local. Decisions about coastal management, including realignment, should incorporate information about the ecosystem services provided under different scenarios. This applies beyond coastal ecosystems, and the site-scale is often the most appropriate scale to carry out such assessments, as this is the scale at which decisions are often taken.

However, the uncertainty associated with these predictions is a significant challenge in flood management. This study focuses on the uncertainty associated with the selection of mathematical models to estimate flood hydrographs and their impact on inundation map predictions. The study involved setting up 27 hydrological models using different mathematical models for the loss, transform, and routing methods within the Hydrologic Engineering center - Hydrologic Modelling system (HEC-HMS) model. The results showed that the peak flow estimation depends on the models adopted for predicting the flood hydrograph. This uncertainty was translated to the flood inundation maps, where the inundated area varied across different flood events. The study also found that the hydrological conditions prior to the start of the event impact the hydrological model predictive uncertainty, and ensemble predictions by Bayesian model averaging can reduce the uncertainty.

Correlates of flood hazard adjustment adoption in four coastal communities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Risk perception; Hazard adjustment; Floods	HOUSEHOLDS EXPECTED RESPONSES; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; RISK PERCEPTION; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; WILDFIRE RISK; EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLORIDA; THREAT; ADAPTATION	This study examines the prediction of three types of household flood hazard adjustment (emergency preparedness, structural mitigation, and nonstructural mitigation) by a comprehensive set of risk perception variables (expected personal consequences, affective response, hazard intrusive thoughts, and hazard intrusive discussions). These risk perception variables were supplemented by six contextual variables (flood information sources, perceived personal protection responsibility, hazard experience, hazard proximity, Community Rating Service (CRS) rating, and demographic characteristics). The data reveal that the risk perception scales measure psychometrically distinct constructs that are only significantly correlated with nonstructural mitigation. Moreover, contextual factors such as hazard information, hazard experience, hazard proximity, age, and home value have significant, but differing effects on the adoption of the three types of hazard adjustments. These results suggest that tailored outreach and information is needed to motivate the adoption of different types of flood hazard adjustments. This is especially important because increasing changes in the global climatic system are expected to produce flood threats of greater frequency and intensity.

To this purpose, wave time series in the period 1979-2018 taken from the global atmospheric reanalysis ERA-Interim by European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were considered. Choosing a significance level equal to 90%, the use of the Mann-Kendall test allowed estimating ongoing trends on the mean values evaluated at yearly and seasonal scale. Furthermore, the assessment of the magnitude of the increase/decrease of the wave parameters was performed through the Theil-Sen estimator. The obtained results underlined that the mean values of the considered wave parameters were characterized by a high occurrence of positive trends in the different Italian seas. The findings of this study could have implications for studies of coastal flooding, shoreline variations, and port operations, and for the assessment of the performances of Wave Energy Converters.

Coral Reef Restorations Can Be Optimized to Reduce Coastal Flooding Hazards	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						coral reefs; wave runup; ecosystem services; coastal protection; reef degradation; reef restoration; climate change; coastal risk	PROTECTION; DYNAMICS; ISLAND; RISE	Coral reefs are effective natural coastal flood barriers that protect adjacent communities. Coral degradation compromises the coastal protection value of reefs while also reducing their other ecosystem services, making them a target for restoration. Here we provide a physics-based evaluation of how coral restoration can reduce coastal flooding for various types of reefs. Wave-driven flooding reduction is greatest for broader, shallower restorations on the upper fore reef and between the middle of the reef flat and the shoreline than for deeper locations on the fore reef or at the reef crest. These results indicate that to increase the coastal hazard risk reduction potential of reef restoration, more physically robust species of coral need to be outplanted to shallower, more energetic locations than more fragile, faster-growing species primarily being grown in coral nurseries. The optimization and quantification of coral reef restoration efforts to reduce coastal flooding may open hazard risk reduction funding for conservation purposes.

Major mycotoxins and derivatives (17), ergot alkaloids (14), Fusarium (23), Aspergillus (18), Penicillium (18), Alternaria (7) and other fungal and unspecific metabolites (20) were found. A higher number of metabolites co-occurred per sample in grains from G (115) than in GS (91). Regulated mycotoxins were below maximum limits except fumonisins B-1,B-2 in 15-20% of grains and aflatoxin B-1. Fusarium metabolites contaminated more than 50% of grains at both locations. Besides FB1,2, bikaverin, aurofusarin, culmorin and 15-hidroxyculmorin were detected at relatively high concentrations. Ergot alkaloids were detected at 2-18 times higher concentrations in grains from G as compared to GS. Majority of Aspergillus mycotoxins were present at a low frequency (5-15%). Penicillium metabolites recovered with higher frequency in GS (55-70%) than in G (20-55%). Alteranaria metabolites prevailed in grains from G (60-80%).

Historical events can be used to identify drivers that impact future events. A catastrophic drought in theUSin the 1930s resulted in an abrupt boundary between areas severely impacted by the Dust Bowl and areas that were less severely affected. Historical primary production data confirmed the location of this boundary at the border between two states (Nebraska and Iowa). Local drivers of weather and soils explained production responses across the boundary before and after the drought (1926-1948). During the drought, however, features at the landscape scale (soil properties and wind velocities) and regional scale (the Missouri River, its floodplain, and the nearby Loess Hills) explained most of the observed variance in primary production. The impact of future extreme events may be affected by land surface properties that either accentuate or ameliorate the effects of these events. Consideration of large-scale geomorphic processes may be necessary to interpret and manage for catastrophic events.	[Peters, Debra P.

Rapid urbanization coinciding with a growing frequency and intensity of floods requires transformative actions in cities worldwide. While abandoning flood prone areas is sometimes discussed as a public climate adaptation option, little attention is paid to studying cumulative impacts of outmigration as an individual choice. To explore the aggregated consequences of households' outmigration decisions in response to increasing flood hazards, we employ a computational agent-based model grounded in empirical heuristics of buyers' and sellers' behaviour in a flood-prone housing market. Our results suggest that pure market-driven processes can cause shifts in demographics in climate-sensitive hotspots placing low-income households further at risk. They get trapped in hazard zones, even when individual risk perceptions and behavioural location preferences are independent of income, suggesting increasing climate gentrification as an outcome of market sorting.

As a strategy for urban flood control, low impact development (LID) practices focus on promoting the infiltration and detention of stormwater runoff. A modelling-based study was conducted to analyse LID performance in urban flooding reduction. Two-dimensional simulations were conducted to visualise the flood risk under different precipitation scenarios and LID schemes. An integrated evaluation system based on life-cycle cost analysis, the analytic hierarchy process, and regret decision theory were applied to assess the LID performance in multiple aspects. The results indicated that the LID practices achieved runoff control and flood mitigation to some extent, especially under mild rainfall events. According to the integrated evaluation, urban flooding risk could be sufficiently reduced with the LID combination of bioretention, infiltration trenches, and rain barrels in the given area.

Although the water, energy, and food security challenges are interconnected, they are dealt with in isolation, which fails to address the challenge of trade-offs and exacerbates the problems. The increased resource scarcity underlines the need for integrated solutions which ensure optimal resource use and maximize benefits. This article uses a nexus perspective to explore possible integrated solutions that support multiple uses of water at different scales and times. The analysis shows that the potential of water resources is underdeveloped and synergies between water, energy, and food are not fully harnessed. With proper coordination and management, water resources can generate multiple benefits for both upstream and downstream areas, including regional public goods such as regional connectivity and flood and drought management.

J	Arefin, MR				Arefin, Mohammed Rafi			The State, Sewers, and Security: How Does the Egyptian State Reframe Environmental Disasters as Terrorist Threats?	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article							URBAN POLITICAL ECOLOGY; GARBAGE; SANITATION; OAXACA	On 25 October 2015, Alexandria, Egypt, experienced heavy rainstorms, which overwhelmed the city's sewer and drainage systems. The storm flooded the city and caused the death of seven residents. How the causes of the 2015 Alexandria floods would be narrated and explained became a subject of national contestation; the Egyptian state claimed that the floods were caused not by failures of urban environmental governance or climate change as others suggested but by an act of terrorism. In this article, I draw on geopolitical ecology and situated urban political ecology to examine the production and contestation of the Egyptian state's narratives of the floods. In doing so, I argue against using the term authoritarian, which predetermines the state's function through an inherited set of characteristics. Rather, I start with the how and why of state power to carefully examine the complex relationship between the state and urban environments. This situated approach reveals how failures of urban environmental governance are being reframed by repressive regimes to further justify their rule	[Arefin, Mohammed Rafi] NYU, Gallatin Sch Individualized Study, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA	New York University	Arefin, MR (corresponding author), NYU, Gallatin Sch Individualized Study, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.	mra349@nyu.edu		Arefin, Mohammed Rafi/0000-0001-9227-9587	National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Center for Arabic Studies Abroad (CASA); Center for Culture, History, and Environment	National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Arabic Studies Abroad (CASA); Center for Culture, History, and Environment	This research was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; the Center for Arabic Studies Abroad (CASA); and the Center for Culture, History, and Environment.		48	6	8	0	11	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	2469-4452	2469-4460		ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR	Ann.

Previous research finds buyouts are concentrated in socially vulnerable areas nationally, and in the Houston area, buyouts have contributed to white flight to the suburbs. The effect of buyouts on equity in urban development is understudied. Existing literature overlooks the fact that buyouts are used strategically and may only nominally be a response to risk. This paper examines buyout inequity in the Houston area by mapping the geographical distribution of buyouts against demographic data and by developing a buyout displacement index to reveal the impact of buyouts in high-risk watersheds.

Opportunities for mitigating net system greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asian rice production: A systematic review	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Greenhouse gas; Soil organic carbon; Energy input; Residue and water management; Climate smart agriculture	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; IRRIGATED RICE; WATER MANAGEMENT; CROPPING SYSTEMS; MEKONG DELTA; LOWLAND RICE; SOIL CARBON; CHEMICAL FERTILIZER; DRYING IRRIGATION; METHANE EMISSION	Southeast Asia (SEA) is a key producer and exporter of rice, accounting for around 28% of rice produced globally. To effectively mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SEA rice systems, field methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions have been intensively studied. However, an integrated assessment of system-level GHG emissions which includes other carbon (C) balance components, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) or energy use, that can positively or negatively influence the net capacity for climate change mitigation is lacking. We conducted a systematic review of published research in SEA rice systems to synthesize findings across four main components of net system emissions: (1) field GHG emissions, (2) energy inputs, (3) residue utilization beyond the field, and (4) SOC change. The objectives were to highlight effective mitigation opportunities and explore cross-component effects to identify tradeoffs and key knowledge gaps. Field GHG emissions were the largest contributor to net system emissions in agreement with existing scientific consensus, with results showing that practices such as floodwater drainage and residue removal are sound options for CH4 mitigation. On the other hand, increasing SOC potentially provides a large GHG mitigation opportunity, with long-term continuous rice cropping and practices such as residue incorporation and biochar application promoting SOC increase. A reduction in energy inputs was mainly achieved by optimizing agrochemical use, especially N fertilizers. For residue utilization beyond the field, GHG emission mitigation mainly came from preventing open field burning through residue removal. Removed residue can subsequently be used for producing energy that offsets GHG emissions associated with conventional fuel sources (e.g. fossil fuel-based electricity generation) or substituting material used in other production systems. Integrating all four components of net system emissions into one analysis underscores the following two main takeaways. First, the components of field GHG emissions and SOC change are the biggest opportunities for reducing net system emissions and need to be considered for effective climate change mitigation. Second, the reduction of C inputs through residue removal and increased soil aeration through multiple drainage will lower CH4 emissions but may also potentially decrease SOC stocks over time. Hence, we argue that future research needs to consider cross-component effects to optimize net system emissions, specifically the "stacking" of best management practices for mitigation related to field GHG emissions or SOC change in long-term experiments.

Future changes to high impact weather in the UK	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate impacts; Adaptation; Resilience; Climate change; Global warming; Extremes	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EURO-CORDEX; DEGREES-C; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; PROJECTIONS; ENSEMBLE; INDEXES; EVENTS; CRIME	High impact weather events such as extreme temperatures or rainfall can cause significant disruption across the UK affecting sectors such as health, transport, agriculture and energy. In this study we draw on the latest set of UK climate projections, UKCP, to examine metrics relating to high-impact weather over the UK and how these change with different levels of future global warming from 1.5 degrees C to 4 degrees C above pre-industrial. The changes to these hazards show increases in the frequency of extremely hot days and nights, with a UK average increase in hot days of between 5 and 39 days per year between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of global warming. Projections indicate an increase in cooling degree days of 134-627% and an increase in growing degree days of 19-60% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of global warming. Extremely hot nights, which are currently rare, are emerging as more common occurrences. The frequency of high daily temperatures and rainfall increase systematically, while the frequency of very cold conditions (based on days where temperatures fall below 0 degrees C) is shown to decrease by 10 to 49 days per year. A reduction in heating degree days, of 11-32% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming, is projected. Levels of daily rainfall, which currently relate to increased risk of river flooding, are shown to increase across the country, with increases of days with high impact levels of rainfall occurring by 1 to 8 days per year between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming. Average drought severity is projected to increase for 3-, 6-, 12- and 36-month-long droughts. The largest changes in the severity of the 12-month drought are between -3 and +19% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming and for 36-month drought between -2 and +54% between 1.5 degrees C and 4 degrees C of warming. The projected future changes in high impact weather from this study will enable the characterization of climate risks and ultimately be able to better inform adaptation planning in different sectors to support the increase in resilience of the UK to future climate variability and change.

This paper investigates the future runoffs of the headwaters of the Tarim River Basin under different emission scenarios by forcing the hydrological model SWAT-Glacier using six regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project. Results indicate that compared to the period of 1976 similar to 2005, temperatures are projected to increase by 1.22 +/- 0.72 degrees C during 2036 similar to 2065 under RCP8.5 scenarios, with a larger increment in the south Tianshan mountains and a lower increment in the north Kunlun Mountains. Precipitation is expected to increase by 3.81 +/- 14.72 mm and 20.53 +/- 27.65 mm during 2036-2065 and 2066-2095, respectively, under the RCP8.5 scenario. The mountainous runoffs of the four headwaters that directly recharge the mainstream of the Tarim River demonstrate an overall increasing trend in the 21st century. Under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the runoff is projected to increase by 3.2% and 3.9% (amounting to 7.84 x 10(8) m(3) and 9.56 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2006-2035. Among them, the runoff of the Kaidu River, which is dominated by rainfall and snowmelt, is projected to present slightly decreasing trends of 3 similar to 8% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. For catchments located in the north Kunlun Mountains (e.g., the Yarkant and Hotan Rivers which are mix-recharged by glacier melt, snowmelt, and rainfall), the runoff will increase significantly, especially in summer due to increased glacier melt and precipitation. Seasonally, the Kaidu River shows a forward shift in peak flow. The summer streamflow in the Yarkant and Hotan rivers is expected to increase significantly, which poses challenges in flood risk management.

Floods have a major impact on soil properties by altering them through dilution, transporting and deposition of minerals. Kerala had a flood on August 2018 with a different duration or temporal variation from three to seven days due to heavy and unexpected rain from June to mid of August 2018, that triggered large landslides on that month. The current study was focussed on the impact of flood on soil chemical properties (pH, soil EC, organic carbon, available NPK) at Thrissur district of Kerala in forest, rubber, nutmeg (homegarden), coconut and open land use systems. Soil samples were collected from flood affected and adjacent non flood affected of these land use systems from 0-20 cm depth after six months of flood and analysed chemical properties according to standard methods. The result of soil pH analysis showed a greater significant decrease in coconut plantation (6.28 to 4.94) after flood. Forest, rubber and homegarden showed an increase in organic carbon (OC) (0.22, 0.77, 0.45% respectively), available P (36.85, 32.6, 38.42 kg/ha respectively). Forest showed a higher amount of available N (84 kg/ha) after flood while rubber, nutmeg and open land use systems showed a decrease in available nitrogen (201.6, 107.1, and 207.9 kg/ha decrease respectively. Forest (196.6 kg/ha), rubber plantation (299.4 kg/ha), nutmeg plantation (292 kg/ha), coconut plantation (421.4 kg/ha) and open condition (125.7 kg/ha) showed a decrease in available K content after flood. Tree based land use systems showed a remarkably better resilience or masked the ill effect of flood very quickly compared to other systems. Integration of shade tolerant species (Grewia robusta, Ailanthus triphysa and Vateria indica) in coconut plantation would help the plantation to adapt flood like situation from soil nutrient loss, also it would increase the productivity of land by maximum utilisation of land resources.

Temporal trend of diarrhea morbidity rate with climate change: Egypt as a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate Change; Diarrhea; Meteorological parameters; Extreme atmospheric temperature; Extreme precipitation	INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; DISEASES; CHILDREN; IMPACT; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; ASSOCIATION; SANITATION; EXTREMES; INDEXES	Many studies have detected a relationship between diarrhea morbidity rates with the changes in precipitation, temperature, floods, droughts, water shortage, etc. But, most of the authors were cautious in their studies, because of the lack of empirical climate-health data and there were large uncertainties in the future projections. The study aimed to refine the link between the morbidity rates of diarrhea in some Egyptian governorates representative of the three Egyptian geographical divisions with the meteorological changes that occurred in the 2006-2016 period for which the medical data are available, as a case study. Medical raw data was collected from the Information Centre Department of the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population. The meteorological data of temperature and precipitation extremes were defined as data outside the 10th-90th percentile range of values of the period of study, and their analysis was done using a methodology similar to the one recommended by the WMO and integrated in the CLIMDEX software. Relationships between the morbidity rates of diarrhea in seven Egyptian governorates and the meteorological changes that occurred in the period 2006 to 2016 were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis to identify the most effective meteorological factor that affects the trend of morbidity rate of diarrhea in each governorate. Statistical analysis revealed that some meteorological parameters can be used as predictors for morbidity rates of diarrhea in Cairo, Alexandria, and Gharbia, but not in Aswan, Behaira, and Dakahlia where the temporal evolution cannot be related with meteorology. In Red Sea, there was no temporal trend and no significant relationships between the diarrhea morbidity rate and meteorological parameters. The predictor meteorological parameters for morbidity rates of diarrhea were found to be depending on the geographic locations and infrastructures in these governorates. It was concluded that the meteorological data that can be used as predictors for the morbidity rate of diarrhea is depending on the geographical location and infrastructures of the target location. The socioeconomic levels as well as the infrastructures in the governorate must be considered confounders in future studies.

Development of an instrument on psychosocial adaptation for people living in a disaster-prone area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Content validity; Disaster-prone area; Psychosocial adaptation instrument; Disaster risk reduction	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; ITEM FIT INDEX; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; SAMPLE-SIZE; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; FARMERS; S-X-2; SCALE	Background: Adaptation is a process of adjusting to the current or expected climate change. The varied adverse outcomes enable people towards necessary adaptation. People living in disaster-prone areas go through a relatively higher frequency of emergencies and exigencies. Gradually people learn to cope with stress and over a while, they develop various strategies for adaptation. The ability to rapidly adapt to such changes helps people to better fit in the environment and prepare themselves for future emergencies. There is no instrument available to measure psychosocial adaptation objectively. The current study reports on the development and validation of psychosocial adaptation instrument. Methods: Cross-sectional study design was adopted for the study. The study population consisted of people living in high-intensity hazard zones for cyclones, earthquakes, and floods in the Cuttack city of Odisha in India. The development of psychosocial adaptation instrument consisted of two phases. Content validity index, Kappa statistic, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were measured. Adopting the multistage sampling method a total of 400 participants were selected using the KISH method and were interviewed. Exploratory factor analysis was attempted to assess the factor structure. Further, the performance of items and total scale were analyzed using the item response theory approach. Results: The psychosocial adaptation instrument showed excellent validity of individual items (I-CVI range: 0.75 to 1.00) and good Kappa (Kappa range: 0.71 to 1.00). The Kuder-Richardson coefficient for the 50 items was (KR20 = 0.851) suggesting that the items have good internal consistency. The test-retest reliability ICC estimate of single measures was 0.916 (95% CI: 0.796, 0.959). Three items were removed as the discrimination parameters were found to be less than one in the item response theory analysis. Conclusion: The developed instrument is valid and has acceptable test-retest reliability. This instrument could pave a new way of quantifying the psychosocial adaption strategies that are widely used by people living in a disaster-prone area.

Which are the effects of wild boar disturbance? How do the responses of specialist or non-specialist species of the habitat differ? LocationNW Sardinia Island (Italy). MethodsWe assessed plant cover during six years within one 60 cm x 60 cm quadrat in each of five areas. To measure the effect of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on vegetation, we used two indices: the evapotranspiration and the synthetic agrometeorological indicator. To quantify the effect of disturbance by boars, we compared two treatments: disturbed and non-disturbed (located outside and inside 1.5 m x 1.5 m exclosures respectively). As a whole, we monitored 60 plots (6 years x 2 treatments x 5 replications). We analyzed data using ANOVA, PERMANOVA and BIO-ENV. ResultsPlant species richness and composition showed significant differences between years and treatments. Species composition was correlated with the evapotranspiration before the vegetative peak during the last period and with the agrometeorological indicator during the whole vegetative period. Specialist species showed much weaker growth, quantified as cover, in the drier years. Starting from the third survey year, plant richness and cover of specialist species were significantly higher in disturbed than in not-disturbed plots. The extent of bare soil generally was not affected by the treatment. ConclusionsMeteorological fluctuations affect plant species composition and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds. The sensitivity of specialist species could make them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Nevertheless, they are resilient to unpredictable disturbances such as burrowing by wild boar. However, our results concerning the positive impact of wild boar disturbance on the vegetation cannot be generalized. Elsewhere, the lack of hunting activity could also be a problem for these habitats.

A large portion of its population was living in non-rural areas attracted by better service provisioning and economic opportunities in fast-developing urban centers. Located at the Amazon Estuary-Delta, Belem is the Amazon's largest metropolitan area, marked by informal urban expansion, and serving as an illustrative case of the oppor-tunities and challenges with which urban populations deal in the region. Faced with significant pressures of absent infrastructure, high rates of poverty, precarious settlements, and ever more frequent flood events, already in the 1980s, Belem was home to the biggest urban reform project of its time in Latin America: The Macro-Drainage Project of the Una River Watershed. Costing over 300 million USD, the pro-ject was intended to have a multilevel governance system through which the Inter-American Development Bank and local government could coordinate project activities. Yet, due to the combination of poor infrastructure and changing rainfall patterns, about half a million people currently remain vulner-able to flood hazards and property damages. Our analysis uses a socio-legal approach to studying grass-roots mobilization against the violation of social and environmental rights aggravated by floods. We also draw on Ostrom's concepts of action arena and action situation to examine collective action across polit-ical and legal arenas within which individuals, grassroots organizations, and the state negotiate/contest flood-related issues. Conducting archival and ethnographic research, we find a story of conflict and coop-eration between the civil society and political and legal actors, which accounts for a mix of optimism and skepticism regarding the improvement in the livelihood of the urban poor affected by this developmental program. This interdisciplinary lens contributes to understanding the limits and potentials of collective action to address, whether through political and/or legal mobilization, urban inequalities and social vul-nerability to environmental and climate change.

The spatial and temporal evaluation of the flood susceptibility was explored in the Quebec basin, Canada. This study provides a new strategy for runoff modelling as one of the complicated variables by developing new machine learning techniques along with remote sensing. A novel scheme of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) known as the generalized structure of GMDH (GSGGMDH) is developed to overcome this classical approach's limitation. A simple time series based scenario with exogenous variables including precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was introduced for runoff forecasting. MODIS data included MOD13Q1 product was employed and a JavaScript code was developed to preprocess collected data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Using different seasonal and non-seasonal lags of all input variables, the developed GSGMDH found the most optimum input combination for each station in terms of simplicity and accuracy, simultaneously (average values; SI = 0.554, RMSRE = 1.55, MAE = 5.076). The precipitation values are modelled with the CanEsm(2) climate change model. To apply NDVI for runoff forecasting, a simple spatial-temporal GSGMDH based model was developed (average values; SI = 0.27; RMSRE = 8.27, MAE = 0.08). The forecasting results indicated that the months in which the maximum runoff occurred have changed, and these months have increased compared to the historic period. In the historical period, the frequency of maximum runoff was in April and March. Still, for the two forecasting periods (i.e. 2020-2039 and 2040-2059), the months in which the maximum runoff has occurred have changed, and their amount has been reduced and added to other months, especially February and August.

However, little is known about how much area can be irrigated and where and when water-saving practices could be used. The objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for irrigated rice cultivation under water-saving technology in Burkina Faso. A two-step, spatially explicit approach was developed and implemented. Firstly, machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) were deployed in ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation. Spatial datasets on topography, soil characteristics, climate parameters, land use, and water were used along with the current distribution of irrigated rice locations in Burkina Faso to drive ENMs. Secondly, the climatic suitability for alternate wetting and drying (AWD), an irrigation management method for saving water in rice cultivation in irrigated systems, was assessed by using a simple water balance model for the two main growing seasons (February to June and July to November) on a dekadal time scale. The evaluation metrics of the ENMs such as the area under the curve and percentage correctly classified showed values higher than 80% for both RF and MaxEnt. The top four predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation were exchangeable sodium percentage, exchangeable potassium, depth to the groundwater table, and distance to stream networks and rivers. Potentially suitable lands for rice cultivation in Burkina Faso were estimated at 21.1 x 10(5) ha. The whole dry season was found suitable for AWD implementation against 25-100% of the wet season. Soil percolation was the main driver of the variation in irrigated land suitability for AWD in the wet season. The integrated modeling and water balance assessment approach used in this study can be applied to other West African countries to guide investment in irrigated rice area expansion while adapting to climate change.

Effect of an extreme flood event on solute transport and resilience of a mine water treatment system in a mineralised catchment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mine remediation; Climate extremes; Climate change; Mine drainage	DRAINAGE; RIVER; DIFFUSE; ZN; FLUCTUATIONS; GEOCHEMISTRY; POLLUTION; BEHAVIOR; DRIVEN; FLUXES	Extreme rainfall events are predicted to become more frequent with climate change and can have a major bearing on instream solute and pollutant transport in mineralised catchments. The Coledale Beck catchment in northwest England was subject to an extreme rainfall event in December 2015 that equated to a 1 in 200-year event. The catchment contains the UK's first passive metal mine water treatment system, and as such had been subject to intense monitoring of solute dynamics before and after commissioning. Due to this monitoring record, the site provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of a major storm event on (1) catchment-scale solute transport, and (2) the resilience of the new and novel passive treatment system to extreme events. Monitoring suggests a modest decline in treatment efficiency over time that is not synchronous with the storm event and explained instead by changes in system hydraulic efficiency. There was no apparent flushing of the mine system during the event that could potentially have compromised treatment system performance. Analysis of metal transport in the catchment downstream of the mine suggests relatively subtle changes in instream chemistry with modest but statistically-significant reductions in zinc in the lower catchment irrespective of flow condition after the extreme event, but most parameters of interest show no significant change. Increased export of colloidal iron and aluminium is associated with major landslips in the mid-catchment after the storm and provide fresh sorption sites to attenuate dissolved zinc more rapidly in these locations, corroborated by laboratory experiments utilising site materials to investigate the attenuation/release of metals from stream and terrestrial sediments. The data are important as they show both the resilience of passive mine water treatment systems to extreme events and the importance of catchment-scale monitoring to ensure continued effectiveness of treatment initiatives after major perturbation.

This study attempts to address these issues by utilizing the semi-distributed hydrological model "Soil and water assessment tool" (SWAT) with new climate datasets and better spatial and altitudinal representation as well as a wider range of future climate forcing models (general circulation model/regional climate model combinations (GCMs_RCMs) from the "Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-South Asia (CORDEX-SA) project to assess different aspects of future hydrology (mean flows, extremes and seasonal changes). Contour maps for the mean annual flow and actual evapotranspiration as a function of the downscaled projected mean annual precipitation and temperatures are produced and can serve as a "hands-on" forecast tool of future hydrology. The overall results of these future SWAT hydrological projections indicate similar trends of changes in magnitudes, seasonal patterns and extremes of the UIB-stream flows for almost all climate scenarios/models/periods-combinations analyzed. In particular, all but one GCM_RCM model-the one predicting a very high future temperature rise-indicated mean annual flow increases throughout the 21st century, wherefore, interestingly, these are stronger for the middle years (2041-2070) than at its end (2071-2100). The seasonal shifts as well as the extremes follow also similar trends for all climate scenario/model/period combinations, e.g., an earlier future arrival (in May-June instead of July-August) of high flows and increased spring and winter flows, with upper flow extremes (peaks) projected to drastically increase by 50 to >100%, and with significantly decreased annual recurrence intervals, i.e., a tremendously increased future flood hazard for the UIB. The future low flows projections also show more extreme values, with lower-than-nowadays-experienced minimal flows occurring more frequently and with much longer annual total duration.

Understanding the effects of hydrological alteration on the life strategy and dynamics of the Populus euphratica riparian forests is becoming increasingly important. Forest gaps led by such disturbances change the structure and function of the desert riparian forest ecosystems. However, there is a lack of research on the gap formation and dynamics of this special forest type, for which the main driving force of the gap disturbance has always been unknown. In this study, we investigated several parameters of P. euphratica forest gap, such as gap size, gap age, gap fraction, and gap makers to quantify the gap disturbance regimes in the natural floodplain forests along the Tarim River in arid northwest China. In the middle reaches of the Tarim River, a total number of 263 gap makers and 60 gaps in six 50 m x 50 m plots with a total area of 1.5 hm(2) were investigated. The result showed that gap fraction was < 5%, and approximately 28.5% of the expanded gaps were from 1.0 to 1.2 in size (ratio of gap diameter to tree height), especially when formed around 1997-2006. The median size of the expanded gap (140.57 m(2)) in the desert riparian forests was smaller than in tropical forests. P. euphratica was the most abundant gap maker, and its share among gap makers was 12-14 times larger than another species. Furthermore, gap makers contributed to the forest gap size, as shown by a significant correlation between the number of gap makers and the size of expanded gaps, especially those that had been created 50-60 years ago (R-2 = 0.455, P < 0.01). The DBH distribution of living trees versus dead trees showed that most P. euphratica mortality occurred in small size classes. However, living trees were equally frequent in large classes, which suggested that large trees were not exclusively injured or died in these P. euphratica stands that were affected by poor habitats, such as water scarcity. We concluded that climate change and anthropogenic activities (increasing water use for irrigation) since the 1970s led to the progressive decrease in water resources at the regional scale and resulted in a higher frequency of forest gaps in the riparian forests along the Tarim River. The results of this study provide useful implications for ecological restoration of P. euphratica to improve sustainable management of desert riparian forests.

Top ten priorities for global saltmarsh restoration, conservation and ecosystem service research	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Saltmarsh conservation and restoration; Ecosystem services; Global variation; Socio-ecological interactions; Research priorities	REDSHANK TRINGA-TOTANUS; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; MANAGED REALIGNMENT; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; WAVE ATTENUATION; DECISION-MAKING; MARINE HABITATS; PLANT DIVERSITY; TIDAL MARSHES; BLUE FORESTS	Coastal saltmarshes provide globally important ecosystem services including 'blue carbon' sequestration, flood protection, pollutant remediation, habitat provision and cultural value. Large portions of marshes have been lost or fragmented as a result of land reclamation, embankment construction, and pollution. Sea level rise threatens marsh survival by blocking landward migration where coastlines have been developed. Research-informed saltmarsh conservation and restoration efforts are helping to prevent further loss, yet significant knowledge gaps remain. Using a mixed methods approach, this paper identifies ten research priorities through an online questionnaire and a residential workshop attended by an international, multi-disciplinary network of 35 saltmarsh experts spanning natural, physical and social sciences across research, policy, and practitioner sectors. Priorities have been grouped under four thematic areas of research: Saltmarsh Area Extent, Change and Restoration fluences of environmental context, climate change, and stakeholder groups on service provisioning), Patterns and	[Petillon, Julien] Univ Rennes, UMR CNRS ECOBIO, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Petillon, Julien; Adams, Janine B.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Dept Bot, Summerstrand Campus, ZA-6031 Gqeberha, South Africa; [Alexander, Meghan; Sharps, Elwyn; Pages, Jordi F.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk Campus, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [McKinley, Emma; Ballinger, Rhoda] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; [Angelini, Christine] Univ Florida, Environm Sch Sustainable Infrastruct & Environm, Weil Hall 365,1949 Stadium Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Balke, Thorsten; Ladd, Cai J.

Influenced by factors such as meteorology, climate change, and human activities, runoff series present non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. To weaken the non-linearity and non-smoothness of runoff time series and improve the accuracy of daily runoff prediction, a new combined runoff prediction model (VMD-HHO-KELM) based on the ensemble Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) algorithm and Harris Hawk Optimisation (HHO) algorithm-optimised Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) is proposed and applied to Gaocun and Lijin hydrological stations. The VMD-HHO-KELM model has the highest prediction accuracy, with the prediction model R-2 reaching 0.95, mean absolute error reaching 13.3, and root mean square error reaching 33.83 at the Gaocun hydrological station, and R-2 reaching 0.96, mean absolute error reaching 8.03, and root mean square error reaching 38.45 at the Lijin hydrological station.

Despite the availability of historical data, there has been no attempt to produce hazard maps for Kuwait. In cooperation with the World Bank, this study investigated the natural and anthropogenic hazards that affect Kuwait. The objective was to assess the hazards that face Kuwait and map the hazards of most concern. Hazard maps depicting the spatial distribution of hazard-prone areas are discussed in this article. Hazard assessment maps were generated using multiple datasets and techniques, including meteorological data, satellite imagery, and GIS. Hazard profiling identified a total of 25 hazards, of which five "priority" hazards were explored in detail: (1) surface water flooding; (2) dust storms and sand encroachment; (3) drought; (4) air pollution; and (5) oil spills. The results of this study can aid decision makers in targeting the hazards of most concern. The developed maps are valuable tools for emergency response and hazard mitigation.

Using Facebook data aggregated to the neighborhood level, this mixed methods study analyses the movement of Facebook users to and from cities struck by storms and floods. This study examines why evacuation varied among cities during Hurricane Dorian, a major hurricane which struck the US southeast in 2019. This study examines the intersecting roles of evacuation orders, policy tools, bonding, bridging, and linking social capital, and social vulnerability. The author combines mobility network analysis and geographic information systems with statistical matching models and geospatial case studies of affected communities. This study highlights how linking social capital and "soft" community-oriented preparedness policies boosted evacuation between cities, while bonding social capital was associated with less evacuation. By clarifying community-level factors in evacuation, this study aims to open a research agenda for analyzing the politics of human mobility during crises. [GRAPHICS] .

The RegioFEM (Regional Floodplain Evaluation Matrix) combines approaches from hydrology, hydraulic engineering, spatial planning and stakeholder engagement to assess the dynamic changes in floodplains in consideration of projected investments in flood protection, expected settlement and infrastructure development and the likely climate-induced changes in flood runoff. In this paper, we present the step-by-step approach of the RegioFEM, outlining how the method can be applied and replicated in practice in support of catchment-oriented and forward-looking flood management policies. The RegioFEM builds on the understanding of floodplains as coupled human and natural systems. It supports the simple comparative evaluation of the expected impacts of future developments in riparian areas on flood risk change and thus provides a basis to anticipate reciprocal effects between flood defence and land development to improve the sectoral interplay of integrated flood policies.

Both modelling frameworks, which can be used separately, are presented. They were tested for the Lauchert catchment in the south-west of Germany, using radar based precipitation data, with the focus on simulating flood events. A soil water balance model with 100 m grid resolution was combined with groundwater model compartments on a subcatchment base for the catchment covering 450 km(2). Results show good fits to observed runoff data and could be verified with soil-moisture and groundwater level observations. Specifically, spatially distributed precipitation data has proven to be very helpful for modelling local storm events, which are often not captured by station based weather data. The presented approach is a promising step towards an early warning system for floods in karst catchments.

This change includes an increase in heavy precipitation and a decrease in light and/or moderate precipitation. This study examines the possible link between these changes and regional climate conditions, using regional surface temperature and Vertically Integrated Moisture Transport (VIMT) records. It is reported that precipitation extremes during the southwest (SW) monsoon season show coherent variability with surface temperature over India. The precipitation spectrum shows significant changes from cold to warm years, with increases in heavy precipitation and decreases in light and/or moderate precipitation. The study reveals a decreasing trend in VIMT over the Bay of Bengal, which is consistent with decreases in the number of monsoon depressions over the region. It is observed that an increase in VIMT over the Arabian Sea shows coherent variation with precipitation extremes over India. The results reported in this article are crucial when considering the increase in drought and flood events in a changing climate.

Several Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) practices followed by farmers in different parts of the country are documented and published. ITKs collected from flood and drought prone areas of south India along with documented ITKs were analysed to know the biotic indicators used by farmers to predict rainfall. These biotic factors were classified as insects, birds and animals. Farmers use 19 types of insects, 17 types of birds and 10 types of animals as indicators to predict rainfall. Various behaviour types of these biotic factors are observed by farmers based on which they make decisions about possibility of rain occurring and in some cases the intensity of rain. These are grassroots innovations which are time tested and facilitated farmers to make their farming decisions.

Record of palaeoclimate across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary from palaeosols in the west-central San Juan Basin, New Mexico, USA	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD			English	Article						Danian; K-Pg boundary; Maastrichtian; palaeosol; San Juan Basin	OJO ALAMO SANDSTONE; MASS EXTINCTION; TERTIARY BOUNDARY; CHICXULUB IMPACT; DECCAN VOLCANISM; TERRESTRIAL; CLIMATE; SYSTEMS; RECONSTRUCTION; PRESERVATION	The mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary is widely attributed to sudden and severe climate changes forced by bolide impact and/or flood basalt volcanism. In terrestrial depositional settings, these changes may potentially be recorded by palaeosols. To test the ability of pedogenic features to record both long-term climate and shorter-term changes preceding and following the Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction event, palaeosols in the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation and the lower Palaeocene (Danian) Nacimiento Formation in the San Juan Basin of north-western New Mexico, USA, were examined, including data from previous studies. The fine-grained facies of the Naashoibito Member comprises grey to greenish-grey and red-banded mudstones displaying pedogenic features including colour mottling, root traces, cutans, ped fabrics, pedogenic slickensides and calcareous nodules. Aside from a high-chroma horizon at the formation base, palaeosols in the lower Nacimiento Formation are broadly similar to those observed in the Naashoibito Member. Lateral and vertical variability of the pedogenic features between correlated sections suggest that soil hydrology varied spatially and temporally from very saturated to seasonally well-drained, with temporal variations controlled by basin sedimentation rates. Abrupt and/or catastrophic climate events precisely at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary are not recorded due to an unconformity at the top of the Naashoibito Member. However, the presence of kaolinite in the clay mineral assemblage of the Nacimiento Formation, particularly near the formation base, but not in the Naashoibito Member, indicates episodic warmth and short (104 years) intervals of more intense weathering conditions during the very early Danian as compared to the late Maastrichtian. Aside from short warm intervals, the overall palaeoclimate during deposition of both formations was warm and consistently subhumid to humid and seasonal, suggesting no substantial long-term (10(5)-10(6)) climate change took place across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary in the San Juan Basin.

However, current regional DFAA analysis research rarely investigates agri-cultural DFAA with special regards to agricultural elements. In this work, a method based on a daily scale index named the standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (SAPEI) and crop characteristics was established to investigate the characteristics of agricultural DFAA during cotton growth stages in the middle-and -lower Yangtze River (MLRYR) during 1961-2020. Additionally, the influence of DFAA on cotton climatic yield in response to flooding and drought was examined by multiple regression. The results demonstrate that the SAPEI efficiently described the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of cotton drought and flood and well characterized cotton DFAA events, especially for short-term events. The most recent decade over the past six decades has seen the most frequent cotton DFAA events, and the only significant trend (p < 0.05) of cotton DFAA frequency was an upward trend in Jiangsu Province. In addition, the middle growth stage of cotton was the most DFAA-affected period within a year. Cotton drought-flood alternations (DF) were more common than flood-drought alternations (FD). The most DF-prone and FD-prone regions differed greatly, but the north-eastern MLRYR was the most DFAA-prone region. In all provinces, the cotton DFAA frequency was significantly and positively related to the cotton drought frequency. Finally, the relations between cotton climatic yield and the intensities of drought and flood were much less significant in the years with more DFAA events than in other years, indicating an obvious negative interaction between drought and flood in cotton DFAA events. This finding, at the regional scale, confirmed previous field-scale conclusions on cotton responses to DFAA stress. In summary, this work provides references for agricultural water management in adapting to climate change.

Future changes in habitat availability for two specialist snake species in the imperiled rocklands of South Florida, USA	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						climate change; conservation; fossorial snakes; habitat availability; key ring-necked snake; pine rocklands; rim rock crowned snake; sea level rise; South Florida	EVERGLADES NATIONAL-PARK; CROWNED SNAKE; CONSERVATION; FORESTS	Rockland habitat in South Florida, USA, is a threatened ecosystem that has been lost, fragmented, or degraded because of urbanization or other anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore, low-lying islands and coastal areas are experiencing sea level rise (SLR) and an increased frequency and intensity of tidal flooding, putting rockland habitats there at increasing risk of ecological change. We evaluated changes in the extent of rockland habitat under various scenarios of future SLR, tidal flooding, and human development for two endemic state-listed threatened species of snakes, the Rim Rock Crowned Snake (Tantilla oolitica) and the Key Ring-necked Snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus). Both snakes are restricted to South Florida. We used recent and historical species' records to determine each species' habitat range. We then estimated the extent of future habitat loss due to SLR and continued human development, as well as degradation of the remaining habitat. We also asked whether the future potential drivers of habitat loss and degradation differ between the two species and across their habitat ranges. We predicted that saltwater intrusion could negatively affect rocklands by 2050, resulting in degradation of 80% of the existing habitat because of an anticipated 42 cm of SLR. Moreover, our model suggests short-term stochastic events such as storm surge and high tides may increasingly saturate the root zone of rockland vegetation before complete inundation. Under the extreme scenario, we predict most of the rockland habitat used by these two species of snakes may be inundated by 2080. Under the extreme SLR scenario, current rocklands are likely to convert to more halophytic habitat (mangrove or salt marsh wetland) within 50-60 years. Under the low scenario, 31% of rockland habitat may be lost due to human development by 2030. Therefore, mitigation actions may help to conserve specialist species within rockland habitat threatened by human activities and climate change.

Recent studies project higher intensity and frequency of heavy rains, and progressive sea level rise continuing over the next decades. Pre-emptive and optimal flood defense policies that adaptively address climate change are needed. However, future climate projections have significant uncertainty due to multiple factors: (a) future CO2 emission scenarios; (b) uncertainties in climate modelling; (c) discount factor changes due to market fluctuations; (d) uncertain migration and population growth dynamics. Here, a methodology is proposed to identify the optimal design and timing of flood defense structures in which uncertainties in 21st century climate projections are explicitly considered probabilistically. A multi-objective optimization model is developed to minimize both the cost of the flood defence infrastructure system and the flooding hydraulic risk expressed by Expected Annual Damage (EAD). The decision variables of the multi-objective optimization problem are the size of defence system and the timing of implementation. The model accounts for the joint probability density functions of extreme rainfall, storm surge and sea level rise, as well as the damages, which are determined dynamically by the defence system state considering the probability and consequences of system failure, using a water depth-damage curve related to the land use (Corine Land Cover); water depth due to flooding are calculated by hydraulic model. A new dominant sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) is used to solve the multi-objective problem optimization. A case study is presented for the Pontina Plain (Lazio Italy), a coastal region, originally a swamp reclaimed about a hundred years ago, that is rich in urban centers and farms. A set of optimal adaptation policies, quantifying size and timing of flood defence constructions for different climate scenarios and belonging to the Pareto curve obtained by the NSGAII are identified for such a case study to mitigate the risk of flooding and to aid decision makers.

In this study, we monitored the change of social vulnerability to multiple environmental hazards over a 20-year (1997-2017) period in Iran and provide a prediction of social vulnerability for 2030 under the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. Following validation of two social vulnerability index (SoVI) values based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a weighed method using observed county-level disaster outcomes, social vulnerability to four environmental variables or risk factors (i.e., drought, flood, landslide, and earthquake) was evaluated with 32 socio-economic values using the weighted method. Social vulnerability was strongly correlated with its three dimensions (i.e., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), and each dimension was strongly correlated with its constituent variables. Results showed that despite improved adaptive capacity between 1997 and 2017, simultaneously increased sensitivity and exposure increased social vulnerability spatially unevenly throughout the country, with greater increases in northern and northeastern than in central and southeastern counties. Extrapolating socio-economic variables and accounting for projected increases in drought severity is expected to increase the social vulnerability of the country by ~27%, with forty-three (11%) mostly northern, northwestern, and northeastern counties with a combined population of ~37 million people (46% of the current Iranian population) exposed to high to very high levels of vulnerability by 2030. Adaptation programs to enhance the resilience following deteriorating socio-economic conditions and climate change-induced droughts in these counties may require better water management strategies to enhance water security. Given the socio-economic conditions of the country and international sanctions, programs should be flanked by more balanced investment in less developed and more vulnerable counties to increase economic and social prosperity and prevent mass migration to more developed areas. This major challenge necessitates more accurate economic planning, development of investment, and improved international relations.

Urban floods cause severe damages to cities and their inhabitants, and they are expected to increase over time. Consequently, urban adaptation is required to shift from traditional infrastructure (grey) to multifunctional infrastructure (blue-green) for improved flood management. Until recently, studies on the role and adoption of blue-green infrastructure have centered around large cities in developed countries, including Melbourne and Rotterdam, among others. Meanwhile, middle-sized cities in developing countries have received less attention. According to the Urban Water Management Transition Framework (UWMTF), cities in developing countries can learn from the experiences of developed cities and leapfrog to more 'water sensitive' practices. Although leapfrogging is context-dependent, our understanding of factors that support leapfrogging remains embryonic. This paper contributes to the scholarly understanding of the governance factors that support and limit leapfrogging. By applying the Governance Assessment Tool through semi-structured interviews and reviewing secondary data, this research assessed the implementation of flood protection infrastructure in San Pedro Cholula, a middle size city of Mexico. This work found the most supportive quality for delivering multifunctional infrastructure, was the extent of the governance system. The governance support extent was rated as moderate-low considering the platform for change is limited to government actors, which has further reinforced traditional approaches to infrastructure. In addition, the necessary governance features of coherence, flexibility and intensity were assessed as constraining change, with flexibility being the least supportive governance factor and ultimately hindering social actors' participation and innovation. While the contemporary governance arrangements of San Pedro Cholula are not yet conducive to promoting a leapfrog in the delivery of urban flood infrastructure, the analysis has pointed to three catalytic factors to underpin a leapfrogging situation: trans-disciplinary science; cross-sector partnerships; and, innovation experiments.

This is an important aspect considering climate change impacts, which are affecting food production across the world. An investigation of academic publications shows that very few studies address opportunities to price rainwater in relation to agricultural production. As such, the objective of the submitted article is to use soil physical property spatial data to create an econometric model. The econometric model itself determines the intensity and direction of action of the soil's physical properties on the ability of the soil to hold rainwater. The results demonstrate the positive effect of physical properties such as porosity and humus content. Important information for farming practice is the relatively pronounced influence of soil acidity (pH) on its retention capacity, which is mainly the result of its effect on soil biogeochemical processes. The most significant variable in terms of the extent of action is the depth of the soil profile, which is in line with general assumptions. The actual evaluation of soil retention capacity was undertaken using an option with the use of a sensitivity analysis. In order to include the non-production function of the soil (retention capacity), we conclude for individual enhanced quality soil ecological units an increased price of 1-12%. These conclusions are particularly valuable because some soils may have a low production potential while also being highly valuable for their particular location in terms of their non-production potential (typically desirable floodwater retention, etc.). Considering climate change, this is a particularly topical issue. The use of enhanced-quality soil ecological units is reflected in a wide range of fields through legislative processes-determining rural land protection class and, especially in the tax obligations of agricultural entities, farming agricultural land.

Tenure Security and Climate Change in Indonesia	LAND			English	Article						land management; obliterated land; floods; land registration; land rights; land disputes	DEMAK; ADAPTATION; SEMARANG; SAYUNG; SUBSIDENCE; COMMUNITY; JUSTICE; AREA	Both human activities and climate change have changed landscapes significantly, especially in coastal areas. Sea level rise and land subsidence foster tidal floods and permanent inundations, thus changing and limiting land use. Though many countries, including Indonesia, are aware of these phenomena, the legal status of this permanently inundated land remains unclear. Indonesia refers to this land legally as obliterated land. This qualification makes former landowners uncertain, as it does not recognize their previous land rights, and creates disputes during land acquisition. In view of policy pressures to develop large-scale projects, the government often fails to include obliterated land legally during land acquisition processes for these projects. This causes unfair and disputed compensation for those former landowners. Current scientific discourses do not yet address this legal quandary. This study therefore has the following three aims: (1) to describe the legal, institutional and procedural contradictions related to obliterated land; (2) to assess the validity of right of the owners whose land parcels are permanently inundated; and (3) to formulate a responsible and tenure responsive policy to deal with obliterated land. We investigate these questions for the construction of a toll road and sea embankment in Kecamatan Sayung, Kabupaten Demak involving obliterated land. We reviewed policies, regulations and documentations related to coastal land and disaster management, and the implementation of land acquisition. We used geospatial data to visualize the ways in which and locations where landscapes, land parcels and land right changed. We determined that legal uncertainty leads to policy inconsistencies in handling obliterated land, specifically during land acquisition. Additionally, former landowners suffer from the legal gaps to establish clarity of land tenure, which prevents them from receiving any compensation. We suggest a law revision that considers the social-historical aspects of land tenure when defining obliterated land. The law should also provide for a fairer and more just compensation for former landowners during land acquisition processes.

Contemporary channel adjustment and geomorphic sensitivity of the lower Mara River and its floodplain wetlands, Tanzania	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Semiarid Mara River; Geomorphic processes; River behaviour; Capacity for adjustment; Behavioural sensitivity	LANDSCAPE SENSITIVITY; OKAVANGO DELTA; LAND-USE; VARIABILITY; THRESHOLDS; RESILIENCE; CATCHMENT; HYDROLOGY; DISCHARGE; RECOVERY	An understanding of river adjustment processes, previous landform changes, and sensitivity to flow regimes are prerequisites for predicting how rivers may respond to future climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Geomorphic river sensitivity is an important concept that can be used to assess the capacity of adjustment for a river type and forecast river responses to hydroclimatic change over time. In this study, we use satellite imagery to characterise and quantify recent geomorphic river adjustment in a dryland river in East Africa, over the past 32 years (1988-2020). The natural or expected river behaviour (i.e., behavioural regime) and capacity for adjustment (i.e., valley confinement) are quantified to provide a measure of the reach-scale geomorphic sensitivity of the lower Mara River, Tanzania. Two behavioural river sensitivity classes are identified. The upper reach is classified as Passive sensitive, exhibiting a limited range of bend adjustments and low migration rates (0.89 m a-1) owing to valley confinement and capacity to recover from disturbance events. The middle reach is classified as Fragile and shows the greatest capacity to adjust in response to intrinsic fluxes. This reach is characterised by numerous lateral migration features and cut-offs (0.2/km) on the floodplain and exhibits the highest migration rates (1.39 m a-1). The lower reach is also categorised as Passive sensitive and undergoes bend and boundary adjustments within its behavioural regime and exhibits the lowest migration rates (0.63 m a-1). However, this reach appears to be operating close to a threshold state and if subjected to a threshold-breaching disturbance event it may 'switch' to a Fragile system where avulsions are dominant. The Mara River shows that geomorphic sensitivity is an important consideration in assessing system response to short-term variability and forecasting future river behaviour and will be key in guiding the management and rehabilitation efforts of other dryland wetlands under different land use and climate change scenarios.

Increasing winter air temperature due to climate change is projected to change the magnitude and frequency of rain-on-snow (RoS) events and increase the number of freeze-thaw cycles and midwinter snowmelt. While daily rainfall records are readily available, less is known about the infiltration and frost formation within urban soils. Thus, there is uncertainty on how warming winter conditions may affect urban flood risk and the climate resilience of cities. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess soil frost formation in the past 70 years in the maritime city of Reykjavik, Iceland (64 degrees N, 21 degrees W), and its co-action with runoff generation, and the potential implications on urban flood risk. To that end, the daily thermal and hy-draulic conditions of the soil were simulated using the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model dating back to 1949, calibrated based on hourly observations from 2007. Model simulations indicated that the minimum soil temperature at 10 cm depth has been warming at a rate of 0.015 degrees C/year in the past seven decades. Climate warming is also noted in a steady decline in frost depth and the duration of soil frost each winter (p-value < 0.05). However, the freezing season has shortened so that the timing of maximum frost coincides more with the timing of maximum RoS and snowmelt events. Furthermore, RoS events during frost have the capacity to pro-duce larger runoff volumes than rainfall or snowmelt alone based on the joint frequency analysis of winter events using the copula method. This, combined with increasing volume during RoS events, suggests that winter floods may intensify in the next decades, which urges re-thinking urban stormwater management in cold climates.

High aqueous salinity does not preclude germination of invasive <i>Iris pseudacorus</i> from estuarine populations	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						coastal wetlands; hydrotime models; macrophyte; seaborne seeds; sea-level rise; seed morphology; vivipary	SEED-GERMINATION; MATERNAL SALINITY; SALT TOLERANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT; GROWTH; DISPERSAL; L.; CONSEQUENCES; ENVIRONMENT	Estuarine ecosystems are threatened by climate change and biological invasions. Among global changes, sea-level rise is broadly impacting tidal wetlands, through increases in salinity and alteration of inundation regimes. Extant freshwater plant species are often presumed to be limited to reaches of estuaries with low salinity and narrow tidal ranges. However, the potential for invasive freshwater species (e.g., Iris pseudacorus) to persist and spread with increased salinity and flooding is poorly understood and can jeopardize native biodiversity and other wetland ecosystem services. The successful establishment of invasive plants will be dependent on their tolerance to salinity and inundation, starting with the germination life stage. Changes to abiotic estuarine gradients may alter the germination process of tidal wetland plant species that underlies significant patterns of plant community composition and biodiversity. We explored germination responses of seeds from two invasive I. pseudacorus populations from freshwater and brackish tidal sites in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. We tested germination dynamics under salinity levels ranging from freshwater to seawater (0, 12.5, 25, and 45 dS/m) and two hydrological conditions (moist and flooded). Salinity levels >12.5 dS/m inhibited germination of seeds from both populations, consistent with viviparism and seedling emergence recorded at field sites. However, seeds exposed to seawater for 55 d germinated once exposed to freshwater. Germination velocity and seed buoyancy differed between populations, likely due to differences in seed coat thickness. Our results demonstrate that after 55 d in seawater, buoyant seeds of I. pseudacorus retain their ability to germinate, and germinate quickly with freshwater exposure. This suggests that invasive populations of I. pseudacorus can colonize new sites following potentially long-distance dispersal of buoyant seeds with tidal currents. These findings inform risk assessments and highlight the need to prioritize the management of invasive I. pseudacorus in estuarine ecosystems impacted by rising sea level.

However, the relationship between the start of growing season (SOS) and the streamflow in snowmelt-dominated watersheds is not clear. In this study, we update the Coupled Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (CHESS) model by incorporating the Growing Season Index (GSI) module to estimate the start of the growing season. The updated CHESS model is then used to calculate the streamflow in the Cleve Creek, Incline Creek and Twin River watersheds located in Nevada in the United States from 1981 to 2017. This updated CHESS can be applied in any regions that are suitable for deciduous vegetation. The streamflow in the static and dynamic scheme in the three watersheds have been simulated between 1981 and 2017 with the NS of 0.52 and 0.80 in the Cleve Creek, 0.46 and 0.75 in the Incline Creek, and 0.42 and 0.70 in the Twin River watersheds, respectively. The results illustrate that the SOS have come around 3-5 weeks earlier during the last 37 years. The results illustrate a high correlation between the temperature and the timing of the SOS. Early SOS leads to a substantial increase in total annual transpiration. An increase in annual transpiration can reduce aquifer recharge and increase cumulative growing season soil moisture deficit. Comparing to the streamflow without vegetation, the streamflow with vegetation is smaller due to transpiration. As the SOS comes earlier, the peaks of the streamflow with vegetation also come earlier. If the shifts in SOS continue, the effects on annual rates of transpiration can be significant, which may reduce the risk of flooding during snowmelt. On the other hand, earlier SOS may cause soil moisture to decline during summer, which would increase the drought stress in trees and the risk of wildfires and insect infestation.

The aim of this paper was to compare ground-based phenological observations of three dominant species (European hornbeam, English oak and narrow-leaved ash) in this ecosystem, with the seasonal trajectory of the greenness index (G(cc)) and thresholds extracted from images taken by phenocameras located on a meteorological mast. The average annual air temperature in the studied years 2014-2017 was 1 degrees C higher than the long-term average, and the precipitation deficit reached 1/3 of annual rainfall. We found a high proportion of above-average warm days in the warmest part of the growing season. Above-average air temperatures significantly accelerated the onset of budbreak in ash. Yet a higher proportion of above-average air temperatures prolonged the period between budbreak to fully developed leaf area, especially in ash and oak. In 2017, rapid cooling after exceptionally warm temperatures at the onset of spring had a detrimental effect on the stand productivity and showed a marked effect on the phenological shifts. The period when leaf area developed was in the range of DOY 66-286 for hornbeam, DOY 79-329 for oak and DOY 88-321 for ash in 2014-2017. The seasonal trajectory of G(cc) showed differences between tree species that corresponded to the dynamics of the onset of phenophases observed in the field. According to image analyses, the phenophase of greenup and maturity for hornbeam and ash had minimal uncertainty. In contrast, the uncertainty was high in the determination of phenophases for oak. Our observations show that the modern method of phenological observation by phenocameras is suitable for mixed forests, but classical ground-based observations by a phenologist are still crucial in order to verify the results.

J	Guo, RF; Zhu, YQ; Liu, YB				Guo, Ruifang; Zhu, Yaqiao; Liu, Yuanbo			A Comparison Study of Precipitation in the Poyang and the Dongting Lake Basins from 1960-2015	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							YANGTZE-RIVER BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; VARIABILITY; CHINA; DROUGHT; IMPACT; DISCHARGE; RUNOFF; TRENDS	The Dongting Lake Basin and the Poyang Lake Basin, both located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, provide 30% of the total water volume for the Yangtze River. Under global climate change, precipitation patterns have undergone varying degrees of changes in different regions. Analysing temporal and spatial rainfall variations is important for understanding the variations in capacity of the two lake basins and the water intake variations by the Yangtze River. This study analyses the temporal and spatial variations of the two basins based on 33 rain-gauge data series from 1960-2015, using statistical methods, GIS spatial analysis and the M-K trend test. Our results showed that the annual precipitation generally increased in the Poyang Lake Basin and we found no obvious changes in the Dongting Lake Basin from 1960 to 2015. Seasonal precipitation levels at interannual scales were roughly consistent, but exhibited variability larger by an order of magnitude in the Poyang Lake Basin than in the Dongting Lake Basin. In general, an increasing trend dominated in spring and autumn while a decreasing trend was observed in summer and winter. The increasing trend was significant from the 1990s in the Poyang Lake Basin and from the late 1990s in the Dongting Lake Basin. It was found that annual precipitation with relatively larger anomalies appeared in ENSO (El Nino and Southern Oscillation) years in most cases, such as in 1963, 1997/1998 and 2002, while a few anomalies appeared in the previous or next year around an ENSO year, such as 1971 and 1978. All monthly precipitation periods with relatively larger or smaller anomalies coincided with ENSO events. In addition, El Nino and SOI (Southern Oscillation) events had significant relationships with negative monthly precipitation anomalies. El Nino and the SOI exerted more significant impacts on the Poyang Lake Basin than on the Dongting Lake Basin, which explains the conclusions regarding seasonal precipitation trends as mentioned above.

Island-wide projections of future climate change (e.g. temperature, rainfall, and net water flux) were made using the latest IPCC AR5 GCMs protocol (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-CMIP5) with 38 GCMs with up to 105 model runs. A review was also made of studies on model-based future projections of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The CMIP5 model's results clearly illustrate that the past trend in temperature (1950-2017) is rising while the rainfall trend remains more or less static. It is also clear from the projections that the long-term trend for temperature rise is fast and significant, while the trend for rainfall and net water flux (P-E) rise appears to be slow and marginal. On the perspective of CMIP5 model's evaluation for the USAPI region, the temperature projections are found to be promising, while the rainfall projection potentials, despite some limitations, are also encouraging. The prime concerns for future disruptions in the USAPI region are the consequences of increasing frequency of the ENSO and related rainfall activities. The long-term warming signal may further complicate the problem. Therefore, the currently water-stressed islands and low-lying atolls in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic of Marshalls Islands (RMI) are particularly vulnerable to El Nino-related heat stress or drought and La Nina-related inundations or flooding. In both cases, the future demand-oriented climate-sensitive water resources sector will be severely affected. A climate-information-based comprehensive water resources management plan (for the 2030s) is therefore essential with more detailed ENSO-related climate information and impacts in terms people can understand and respond to.

Grazed perennial grasslands can match current beef production while contributing to climate mitigation and adaptation COMMENT	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS			English	Editorial Material							CARBON SEQUESTRATION; CATTLE FEEDLOT; METHANE EMISSIONS; MANAGEMENT; SOIL; QUALITY; COMMUNITIES; PASTURE; AGRICULTURE; IMPACTS	The U.S. grain-finished beef system is highly productive but has many negative consequences for human health and well-being because it pollutes surface and groundwaters, exacerbates flooding, reduces biodiversity, and contributes to climate change. Moving the entire U.S. grain-fed beef production system to a grass-finished system is possible without displacing food production and under conservative soil carbon (C) change estimates would result in a reduced but similar C footprint, while improving soil health, water quality, and biodiversity. More optimistic estimates for soil C accumulation indicate the system would result in significant atmospheric C drawdown. Agroecological transformation like this is limited only by our imagination and policies that incentivize agriculture for the public good rather than profits for a few.

Atmospheric rivers drive flood damages in the western United States	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							OROVILLE DAM; CLIMATE; CALIFORNIA; ALGORITHM; TRACKING; FLUXES; WINTER; SCALE; VAPOR	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are extratropical storms that produce extreme precipitation on the west coasts of the world's major landmasses. In the United States, ARs cause significant flooding, yet their economic impacts have not been quantified. Here, using 40 years of data from the National Flood Insurance Program, we show that ARs are the primary drivers of flood damages in the western United States. Using a recently developed AR scale, which varies from category 1 to 5, we find that flood damages increase exponentially with AR intensity and duration: Each increase in category corresponds to a roughly 10-fold increase in damages. Category 4 and 5 ARs cause median damages in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, respectively. Rising population, increased development, and climate change are expected to worsen the risk of AR-driven flood damage in future decades.	[Corringham, Thomas W.; Ralph, F.

This is surprising, given the wide use of GPR on ice and the success of early aquatic experiments in the 1970s and 1980s. The past 15 years have seen advances in modes of antenna deployment, understanding of limiting environmental conditions and applications to geotechnical engineering (e.g. bridge support scour), siltation (e.g. sedimentation in reservoirs and flood-relief water-courses, sometimes due to climate change); location of sediment cores for palaeoecology; search and rescue operations and environmental crime (e.g. illegal dumping of waste in water). This manuscript will review the above, from common techniques through to typical applications with geotechnical engineering, archaeological and forensic case studies that demonstrate some of the surveys covered in the review.

With global climate change causing an increase in river flooding in the United States over the past decade, producers need information to determine the best course of action in flooded fields treated with atrazine into which they wish to immediately plant soybean. Studies were designed to understand the effect of flooding on atrazine residual activity including atrazine concentration, soybean injury, and soybean yield. In 2012, soybean yield in flooded treatments was reduced by prior atrazine application. In 2014, soybean injury was <10% in all plots, and nonflooded, atrazine-treated soils had yields equal to the nontreated. Findings from this research indicated that it is possible for producers to consider replanting soybean after atrazine application, with appropriate changes to product labeling.

J	Cartwright, A; Tsavdaris, A; Burton, R; Matthews, D				Cartwright, Alexander; Tsavdaris, Alexandros; Burton, Russell; Matthews, Daniel			Delivering temporary flood defence deployment plans: lessons learned from case studies in the UK	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; education & training; management	RISK-MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE; BASINS; RIVER	Temporary flood barriers can be used to create short-term, artificial walls blocking water flow across a floodplain as an alternative to permanent heavy-engineering solutions. However, to be successful, there needs to be an effective plan for the deployment of temporary flood defences. The authors of this paper highlight the lessons learned and knowledge gained through producing site-specific temporary flood defence deployment plans at Torksey Lock and St Neots in the UK. A deployment plan should operate at operational, strategic and tactical levels, with limitations at each level considered. It should also aim to resolve the risks associated with previous experiences of operational failure of temporary barriers. Limitations nevertheless remain, including awareness of and response to a structural failure. Testing of deployment plans is beneficial to flood risk engineers, emergency planning practitioners and the wider community.

Changes in these Arctic elements are interconnected, and most interactions accelerate the rate of change. The changes affect infrastructure, economics, and cultures of people inside and outside of the Arctic, including in temperate and tropical regions, through sea level rise, worsening storm and hurricane impacts, and enhanced warming. Coastal communities worldwide are already experiencing more regular flooding, drinking water contamination, and coastal erosion. We describe and summarize the nature of change for Arctic permafrost, land ice, and sea ice, and its influences on lower latitudes, particularly the United States. We emphasize that impacts will worsen in the future unless individuals, businesses, communities, and policy makers proactively engage in mitigation and adaptation activities to reduce the effects of Arctic changes and safeguard people and society.

Looming climate change and increasing population in coastal areas means these hazards could become even more devastating in the future. This paper first develops estimates of areas most impacted by hurricane flooding and wind damage and then assesses the generalised patterns of demographic change in those at-risk locations, disaggregating by both race and age to account for the complex shifts in demographic composition that have occurred over the past five decades. We find evidence of racial, ethnic, and age disparities in exposure to hurricane flooding and wind impacts. Our results highlight not only the uneven burden of risk placed on those unable or unwilling to move, but also the structural privilege that enables the white population to remain in place, even in the face of increased hurricane damage risk.

Sedimentary facies analysis indicates that tracks from the upper Baoxiangsi Formation and the lower Shuanghe Formation occurred in lake shore and flood plain environments, respectively. Based on the morphological analysis, the artiodactyl tracks from the Baoxiangsi Formation are attributed to Anoplotheriipus zeuctus. Combined with fossil records and morphological characteristics, the artiodactyl and creodont tracks were probably produced by entelodonts and mesonychids, respectively. The superimposition of artiodactyl tracks with varying sizes indicates coexistence of juveniles and adults as well as their gregarious behaviour. The co-occurrence of artiodactyl tracks and creodont tracks suggests the predator-prey relationship and ecological chain during the late Eocene. The presence of mammal tracks in the Jianchuan Basin coincides with the climate change from dry to wet in the late Eocene, implying the climatic and ecological effects of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.

Using Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) calculated from multi-source merged data sets, we find widespread drying in the global midlatitudes, and wetting in the northern subtropics and in spring between 45 degrees N-65 degrees N, during 1971-2016. Formal detection and attribution analysis shows that human forcings, especially greenhouse gases, contribute significantly to the changes in 0-10 cm SSI during August-November, and 0-100 cm during September-April. We further develop and apply an emergent constraint method on the future SSI's signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and trends under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5. The results show continued significant presence of human forcings and more rapid drying in 0-10 cm than 0-100 cm. Our findings highlight the predominant human contributions to spatiotemporally heterogenous terrestrial aridification, providing a basis for drought and flood risk management. Historical latitudinal and seasonal trends in global soil moisture aridity are attributable to greenhouse gas emissions.

Here, we develop a data-driven approach to analyzing economic risks due to flood closures along the inland waterways that combines agent-based, economic interdependence, and Bayesian modeling. We demonstrate our framework by evaluating economic impacts of various flood disruptions along the Upper Mississippi River and determining cases where a publicly operated, flood-resilient port located near the mouth of the river can reroute shipments and mitigate production losses for the region. We find that Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Missouri are the states that suffer the most production losses from flood disruptions and that agriculture and chemical manufacturing are the most impacted industries. However, during floods whose return periods exceed 30-years, the flood resilient port becomes cost-effective in mitigating losses for the region. Our methodology can be easily extended to other hazards and sections of the inland waterways.

To identify the key influencing factors of functional loss in Chinese urban communities under floods, this paper explored the influencing factors and factor combinations through a social network analysis approach using the 265 cases of urban communities in China affected by floods collected from 2017-2021 as research data. The key influencing factors and factor combinations were identified comprehensively using multiple indicator analyses such as core-periphery structure, node centrality, and factor pairing. The analysis results showed that "road disruption", "housing inundation", and "power interruption" are the three most critical factors affecting the functional loss of urban communities in China under floods, followed by "residents trapped", "enterprises flooded", and "silt accumulation". In addition, "road disruption-housing inundation", "housing inundation-residents trapped", and "road disruption-residents trapped" are the most common combinations of influencing factors.

Such losses from floods can be reduced by issuing timely early warnings and through effective response mechanisms based on situational intelligence during emerging flood situations. This paper presents the outcome of a literature review that was conducted to identify the types and sources of the intelligence required for flood warning and response processes as well as the technology solutions that can be used for offering such intelligence. Twenty-seven different types of intelligence are presented together with the technologies that can be used to extract such intelligence. Furthermore, a conceptual architecture that illustrates how relevant technology solutions can be used to extract intelligence at various stages of a flood cycle for decision-making in issuing early warnings and planning responses is presented.

J	Nohrstedt, D				Nohrstedt, Daniel			When do disasters spark transformative policy change and why?	POLICY AND POLITICS			English	Article						disasters; transformation; scenarios; learning; policy change; policy action; resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; CRISIS; RISK; RESILIENCE; RESPONSES; EVENTS; SHOCKS	Floods, earthquakes, droughts, and other recurrent disasters around the globe have sparked renewed interest in whether and how disasters can be leveraged as turning points for transformation toward more sustainable and resilient societies. As the transformative potential of disasters increasingly gains prominence in different research fields, it is important to describe how different scientific approaches view the relationship. This article synthesises key insights from the policy sciences and public administration scholarship regarding the link between disruptive disaster events and policy activity aiming towards societal transformation. Key explanatory perspectives are discussed, including dynamics associated with institutional crisis, policy subsystems, agenda-setting and issue salience, governance capacity, policy-oriented learning and concentration of power, and situated in relation to four scenarios of potential disaster impacts on policymaking aiming at transformation. The results of this synthesis seek to enhance our understanding of when disasters may spark transformative change. Based on these findings, the article identifies priorities for future research into policymaking in the wake of disaster.

This research studies IFRM methods in three aspects: flood risk identification of high-risk areas, flood risk assessment to quantify economic losses, and flood risk management to identify structural measures with the greatest engineering benefits. These methods were applied to Beijing as a case study, and the results showed that the Zuoan-Road area was a high-risk area with economic losses ranging from 0.7 million to 35.9 million euros over different return periods. There are five structural measures in Zuoan-Road area, with engineering benefits ranging from 0.97 to 1.60 over different return periods, and the one with the greatest engineering benefits had a fifty-year return period. The results of this research can be used to support urban flood risk management in Beijing.

The Government of Canada has worked with insurers to introduce flood insurance for the first time as a part of a broader shift towards FRM to limit the growing costs of flooding. The viability of flood insurance in Canada, however, has been questioned by research that disputes the utility of purchasing coverage by property owners. This study tested this assumption by drawing on public opinion survey data to assess factors that influence decisions about the utility of insurance. The findings reveal that Canadians have limited knowledge of flood insurance coverage, exhibit a low willingness-to-pay for both insurance and property-level flood protection measures, and expect governments to shoulder much of the financial burden of flood recovery through disaster assistance.

We selected two districts in Bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events: Sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and Brahmanbaria, which experiences cyclones and related floods. Survey data was collected from 120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second, unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis, especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.

To produce global storm surge projections from 1950 to 2050, we force the Global Tide and Surge Model with a similar to 25-km resolution climate model ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). This is the first time that such a high-resolution ensemble is used to assess changes in future storm surges across the globe. We validate the present epoch (1985-2014) against the ERA5 climate reanalysis, which shows a good overall agreement. However, there is a clear spatial bias with generally a positive bias in coastal areas along semi-enclosed seas and negative bias in equatorial regions. Comparing the future epoch (2021-2050) against the historical epoch (1951-1980), we project ensemble-median changes up to 0.1 (or 20%) in the 1 in 10-year storm surge levels. These changes are not uniform across the globe with decreases along the coast of Mediterranean and northern Africa and southern Australia and increases along the south coast of Australia and Alaska. There are also increases along (parts) of the coasts of northern Caribbean, eastern Africa, China and the Korean peninsula, but with less agreement among the HighResMIP ensemble. Information resulting from this study can be used to inform broad-scale assessment of coastal impacts under future climate change. Plain Language Summary In the next few decades, coastal flooding is expected to become more frequent due to rising sea levels and changes in storms. To understand and prepare for these changes, we use a global hydrodynamic and multiple climate models to investigate how storm surges (a temporarily rise in water level during a storm) will respond to a warmer climate. These are the first global projections of storm surges based on highly detailed climate models (25-50 km). We compare the model output for recent years (1985-2014) with real-world weather data, known as reanalysis data, and find a good overall agreement. However, the comparison also shows relatively large differences with larger or smaller values in certain areas. For the future (2021-2050), results show storm surge changes up to 20%. These changes vary around the world. Some areas (Mediterranean, northern Africa, and southern Australia) might experience lower storm surges, whereas other areas (South Australia, Alaska, the northern Caribbean, eastern Africa, China, and the Korean Peninsula) might experience higher storm surges. By using advanced computer models as done here, we are able to better understand how climate change could impact coastal area and thus make informed decisions for the future.

Foundations of modeling resilience of tidal saline wetlands to sea-level rise along the US Pacific Coast	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Tidal wetlands; Sea-level rise; Climate change; Resilience; Bayesian network model	FLOOD RISK; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; PARTICIPATION; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS	ContextTidal saline wetlands (TSWs) are highly threatened from climate-change effects of sea-level rise. Studies of TSWs along the East Coast U.S. and elsewhere suggest significant likely losses over coming decades but needed are analytic tools gauged to Pacific Coast U.S. wetlands.ObjectivesWe predict the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) on the elevation capital (vertical) and migration potential (lateral) resilience of TSWs along the Pacific Coast U.S. over the period 2020 to 2150 under a 1.5-m SLR scenario, and identified TSWs at risk of most rapid loss of resilience. Here, we define vertical resilience as the amount of elevation capital and lateral resilience as the amount of TSW displacement area relative to existing area.MethodsWe used Bayesian network (BN) modeling to predict changes in resilience of TSWs as probabilities which can be useful in risk analysis and risk management. We developed the model using a database sample of 26 TSWs with 147 sediment core samples, among 16 estuary drainage areas along coastal California, Oregon, and Washington.ResultsWe found that all TSW sites would lose at least 50% of their elevation capital resilience by 2060 to just before 2100, and 100% by 2070 to 2130, depending on the site. Under a 1.5-m sea-level rise scenario, nearly all sites in California will lose most or all of their lateral migration resilience. Resilience losses generally accelerated over time. In the BN model, elevation capital resilience is most sensitive to elevation capital at time t, mean tide level at time t, and change in sea level from time 0 to time t.ConclusionsAll TSW sites were projected with declines in resilience. Our model can further aid decision-making such as prioritizing sites for potential management adaptation strategies. We also identified variables most influencing resilience predictions and thus those potentially prioritized for monitoring or development of strategies to prevent loss regionally.

In this study, the statistical characteristics of precipitation variations in eight subregions were detected based on daily precipitation records from 798 meteorological sites during 1958-2019, and Long-term precipitation Concentration Index (LCI), Annual precipitation Concentration Index (ACI) and Seasonal precipitation concentration index (SPCI) values were used to analyse temporal heterogeneity of precipitation concentrations. Results showed that the LCI and ACI values were generally characterized by "high in southwest, low in Tibet, high in summer, and low in winter." Specifically, ACI presented significant increasing trends in 5 regions (Northeast, North, Tibetan Plateau, Western Northwest, and Eastern Northwest), insignificant increasing trends in 2 regions (Jianghuai and Southwest), and a significant decreasing trend in 1 region (South), indicating the potential of increased drought and flood risks. SPCI exhibited an increasing trend in the spring months in Northeast China (p < 0.01), and significant increasing trends in the Tibetan Plateau and Western Northwest China during autumn months (p < 0.05). Attribution analyses on 11 large-scale climatic factors showed that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) strongly influenced the precipitation concentration indices with distinct zonal characteristics. ENSO, which is the most significant factor affecting the precipitation concentrations, had the strongest positive effect in South China and coastal areas. Meanwhile, the NAO presented a notable negative influence on the ACI, while the AMO exhibited a positive impact in Northern China. Our work added to the body of evidence that the extreme rainfall events have been significantly increasing in the Tibetan Plateau, Western Northwest China, and Eastern Northwest China (p < 0.05), and that the north-western regions of China have been experiencing significant wetting trends. Furthermore, climate change would potentially lead to more extreme drought-flood events in the future.

Migrating rivers, consequent paleochannels: The unlikely partners and hotspots of flooding	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						2018 Kerala flood; Paleochannel; River migration; Object Oriented Analysis; Principal Component Analysis	INDIA; TECTONICS; KERALA; BASIN; INFORMATION; GROUNDWATER; MIDDLE	Furious floods have become an omnipresent reality with the dawn of climate change and its transition to adult-hood. Since climate change has now become an accepted reality, analysing the factors that favour or disfavour floods are an urgent requirement. Here we showcase the role of paleochannels, a product of migrating rivers, in a catastrophic flood in the south-western part of the Indian Peninsula. This study exposes whether these geo-morphic features facilitate or impede floods. For the purpose of extracting paleochannels and floodwater map-ping, we utilized multiple satellite datasets and took advantage of diversified feature selection algorithms. Paleochannels were demarcated viz., initial identification of a few paleochannels from literature and confirma-tion through high-resolution Google Earth (GE) images, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Sentinel-2 images using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and a supervised classification of the principal bands 1, 2, and 3. False-positives were eliminated using Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA), which reduced the 964,254 poly-gons to 23,254. These polygons were visually affirmed using GE images that resulted in 115 paleochannels as the final collection. A few locations were verified through Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) using the Schlumberger method. The features were analysed with the floodwaters of the 2018 catastrophic flood, extracted from Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which was delineated for different temporal limits including the day of peak flood of August 17, 2018. During the peak flood, the inundation of the study area extended to 534.86 km2 with all the paleochannels getting immersed in floodwater. After 44 days of peak flood, the post-flood analysis revealed that when the floodwater receded 50%, the paleochannels emptied 87.39%, with the midland paleochannels discharging more than those of lowlands. Thus, such geomorphic features can be flood hotspots, but can be considered for discharging floodwater to mitigate flood risk in case of unprecedented rain. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the cumulative transmission of multiple paths, how to assess the dynamic changes of LBP and reveal the driving evolution is not clear. Here, taking Hulun, Daihai and Wuliangsuhai lake basins in the cold and arid region as the study case, we established an LBP assessment method that coupled multiple driving paths. For the first time, this study reveals the dynamic and driving evolution of LBP and found that rapid economic development and accelerated urbanization dramatically increased the LBPs in the three lakes. Specifically, the LBPs in the three lake basins has increased by 90%-270 % in the past 32 years, and they experienced a stable stage driven by climate (1987-1992), followed by a slight increasing stage driven by agriculture (1993-2004) and finally a significant increase stage (2005-2018) driven by industry and urbanization. Different degrees of warming, populations and development intensities of agriculture and livestock were the main factors driving the spatial differences in LBPs in the three lake basins. The LBPs in the Hulun, Daihai and Wuliangsuhai Lake Basins exhibited phase driving, continuous driving and ineffective driving characteristics to the water environment changes, respectively, which were related to lake basin governance. Compared with the driving paths of water quality and water quantity, the LBP was most strongly transmitted through the water ecological path. Rapid economic development and accelerated urbanization will bring greater LBPs to the lake basins. Lake management should promote the construction of water environmental protection mechanisms that correspond to urbanization, such as land use, and continue to strengthen watershed governance to alleviate the impact of LBP, especially the impact on the service functions of water ecosystem. Our method quantified the LBPs that were transmitted from different driving paths and provided action priorities for watershed management.

To fulfil that purpose modelling and mapping habitat suitability of species is becoming essential. The freshwater ecosystem is today one of the most threatened ecosystems and fishes are especially vulnerable for climate change as they have fewer choices for dispersal. The altered thermal regimes, land use and hydrology together cause isolation, fragmentation and changes in distributional patterns of fish. In such landlocked situation, there is utmost need to identify suitable environmental conditions for a species to exist. Indigenous fish is one of the essential components of healthy inland aquatic ecosystems as they fulfil several important ecological functions and form an important part of the aquatic food web. Amblypharyngodon mola is an economically and ecologically important indigenous freshwater fish species of the tropical and subtropical floodplain rivers and wetland habitats of India and Bangladesh. However, lack of knowledge about the key environmental indicators is hindering appropriate management and conservation initiation. Modelling and mapping the distribution of A. mola was done for identifying the key environmental variables and predicting the potential distribution area of the species in current climatic condition. The species occurrence data were accessed from both primary and secondary sources and used after cleaning and removing biasness. Climatic, topographic, landcover and soil variables of 1 km resolution were used as environmental predictors. India and Bangladesh together were used as model background. Ensemble species distribution modelling was done, and the model was validated by area under the curve (AUC) value (> 0.7). The result showed that the Ganges delta of lower reach going through West Bengal and Bangladesh is most suitable for A. mola occurrence. Annual upstream precipitation (hydroclim_12), soil pH in water (soil_average_02) and elevation (ele_01) are the key indicators for predicting the habitats suggesting the importance of hydroclimatic, topographic and soil variables in determining the distribution of the fish.

Reducing water can vastly reduce methane (CH4) emissions; however, this net climate benefit may be offset by enhanced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil. The main aims of this study were: to determine the effects of AWD on yield and ecosystem C dynamics, and to establish the underlying mechanistic basis for observed trends in net ecosystem C gain or loss in an Italian rice paddy. We investigated the effects of conventional water management (i.e. conventionally flooded paddy; CF) and AWD on biomass accumulation (aboveground, belowground, grain), key ecosystem C fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net primary productivity (NPP), gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), autotrophic respiration (RA), heterotrophic respiration (RH)), and soil organic matter (SOM) decay for four common commercial European rice cultivars. The most significant finding was that neither treatment nor cultivar affected NEE, GPP, ER or SOM decomposition. RA was the dominant contributor to ER for both CF and AWD treatments. Cultivar and treatment affected the total biomass of the rice plants; specifically, with greater root production in CF compared to AWD. Importantly, there was no effect of treatment on the overall yield for any cultivar. Possibly, the wetting-drying cycles may have been insufficient to allow substantial soil C metabolism or there was a lack of labile substrate in the soil. These results imply that AWD systems may not be at risk of enhancing soil C loss, making it a viable solution for climate change mitigation and water conservation. Although more studies are needed, the initial outlook for AWD in Europe is positive; with no net loss of soil C from SOM decomposition, whilst also maintaining yield. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The large majority of the articles were field observational studies based on nonnative fish populations. A focus on ecological interactions, in particular competition and predation, was predominant in these studies. Hypotheses related to environmental filters and biotic resistance were used most frequently to support studies on river the floodplain, but many studies not addressed the invasion theory. Impoundment was the introduction vector associated with the largest number of studies of nonnative populations. We present conceptual aspects that may guide future studies on nonnative population ecology and inform conservation policies in floodplain ecosystems.

This article argues that governance is critical for meeting the challenges in the water sector in post-conflict settings, not just for restoring livelihoods and basic human wellbeing, but also for supporting sustainable development and addressing emerging challenges such as the increasing prevalence of droughts and floods that threaten to erase many of the peace dividends that water may provide at war's end. This article examines water and water law through the lens of State fragility, conflict and governance to shed light on the importance of building resilient and flexible water governance institutions that can withstand what is often a precarious peacebuilding process in which conflict may continue even after a peace agreement is reached.

This study uses panel data methods to explore the psychological factors affecting probability neglect of flood risk relevant to the zero end-point of the probability weighting function in Prospect Theory, and willingness-to-pay for flood insurance. In particular, we focus on explanatory variables of anticipatory and anticipated emotions, as well as the threshold of concern. Moreover, results obtained under real and hypothetical incentives are compared in an experiment with high experimental outcomes.

J	Liu, S; Tan, NZ; Liu, R				Liu, Shuang; Tan, Nengzhi; Liu, Rui			A Weighted <i>k</i>-Nearest-Neighbors-Based Spatial Framework of Flood Inundation Risk for Coastal Tourism-A Case Study in Zhejiang, China	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						climate change; sensitivity analysis; evaluation accuracy; hazard; year return period; overall accuracy	SOIL-EROSION RISK; HAZARD MANAGEMENT; PROVINCE; GIS; TYPHOON; DISASTERS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; AREAS; RIVER	Flood inundation causes socioeconomic losses for coastal tourism under climate extremes, progressively attracting global attention. Predicting, mapping, and evaluating the flood inundation risk (FIR) is important for coastal tourism. This study developed a spatial tourism-aimed framework by integrating a Weighted k Nearest Neighbors (WkNN) algorithm, geographic information systems, and environmental indexes, such as precipitation and soil. These model inputs were standardized and weighted using inverse distance calculation and integrated into WkNN to infer the regional probability and distribution of the FIR. Zhejiang province, China, was selected as a case study. The evaluation results were mapped to denote the likelihood of an FIR, which was then validated by the historical Maximum Inundation Extent (MIE) extracted from the World Environment Situation Room. The results indicated that 80.59% of the WkNN results reasonably confirmed the MIE. Among the matched areas, 80.14%, 90.13%, 65.50%, and 84.14% of the predicted categories using WkNN perfectly coincided with MIE at high, medium, low, and very low risks, respectively. For the entire study area, approximately 2.85%, 64.83%, 10.8%, and 21.51% are covered by a high, medium, low, and very low risk of flood inundation. Precipitation and elevation negatively contribute to a high-medium risk. Drainage systems positively alleviate the regional stress of the FIR. The results of the evaluation illustrate that in most inland areas, some tourism facilities are located in high-medium areas of the FIR. However, most tourism facilities in coastal cities are at low or very low risk, especially from Hangzhou-centered northern coastal areas to southern Wenzhou areas. The results can help policymakers make appropriate strategies to protect coastal tourism from flood inundation. Moreover, the evaluation accuracy of WkNN is higher than that of kNN in FIR. The WkNN-based framework provides a reasonable method to yield reliable results for assessing FIR. The framework can also be extended to other risk-related research under climate change.

It is therefore important to use current global climate models to project future changes in precipitation extremes. The present study aims to assess the future changes in precipitation extremes over South Asia from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Global Climate Models (GCMs). The results were derived using the modified Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, student's t-test, and probability density function approach. Eight extreme precipitation indices were assessed, including wet days (RR1mm), heavy precipitation days (RR10mm), very heavy precipitation days (RR20mm), severe precipitation days (RR50mm), consecutive wet days (CWD), consecutive dry days (CDD), maximum 5-day precipitation amount (RX5day), and simple daily intensity index (SDII). The future changes were estimated in two time periods for the 21(st) century (i.e., near future (NF; 2021-2060) and far future (FF; 2061-2100)) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The results suggest increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation indices under the SSP5-8.5 scenario towards the end of the 21(st) century (2061-2100). Moreover, from the results of multimodel ensemble means (MMEMs), extreme precipitation indices of RR1mm, RR10mm, RR20mm, CWD, and SDII demonstrate remarkable increases in the FF period under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The spatial distribution of extreme precipitation indices shows intensification over the eastern part of South Asia compared to the western part. The probability density function of extreme precipitation indices suggests a frequent (intense) occurrence of precipitation extremes in the FF period under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, with values up to 35.00 d for RR1mm and 25.00-35.00 d for CWD. The potential impacts of heavy precipitation can pose serious challenges to the study area regarding flooding, soil erosion, water resource management, food security, and agriculture development.

Progress and opportunities in advancing near-term forecasting of freshwater quality	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Review						aquatic ecosystem modeling; data assimilation; ecological forecasting; freshwater management; hindcast; hydrological forecasting; near-term iterative forecasting cycle; uncertainty; water quality; water quantity	PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; ECOLOGICAL FORECAST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; WEATHER; MODEL; LAKE; INFORMATION; UNCERTAINTY; DECISIONS	Near-term freshwater forecasts, defined as sub-daily to decadal future predictions of a freshwater variable with quantified uncertainty, are urgently needed to improve water quality management as freshwater ecosystems exhibit greater variability due to global change. Shifting baselines in freshwater ecosystems due to land use and climate change prevent managers from relying on historical averages for predicting future conditions, necessitating near-term forecasts to mitigate freshwater risks to human health and safety (e.g., flash floods, harmful algal blooms) and ecosystem services (e.g., water-related recreation and tourism). To assess the current state of freshwater forecasting and identify opportunities for future progress, we synthesized freshwater forecasting papers published in the past 5 years. We found that freshwater forecasting is currently dominated by near-term forecasts of water quantity and that near-term water quality forecasts are fewer in number and in the early stages of development (i.e., non-operational) despite their potential as important preemptive decision support tools. We contend that more freshwater quality forecasts are critically needed and that near-term water quality forecasting is poised to make substantial advances based on examples of recent progress in forecasting methodology, workflows, and end-user engagement. For example, current water quality forecasting systems can predict water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and algal bloom/toxin events 5 days ahead with reasonable accuracy. Continued progress in freshwater quality forecasting will be greatly accelerated by adapting tools and approaches from freshwater quantity forecasting (e.g., machine learning modeling methods). In addition, future development of effective operational freshwater quality forecasts will require substantive engagement of end users throughout the forecast process, funding, and training opportunities. Looking ahead, near-term forecasting provides a hopeful future for freshwater management in the face of increased variability and risk due to global change, and we encourage the freshwater scientific community to incorporate forecasting approaches in water quality research and management.

Identifying new research gaps	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						biodiversity; carbon cycle; climate change; geodiversity; natural hazards; piping erosion; review	LOESS-DERIVED SOILS; TEMPERATE CLIMATE; EROSION PROCESSES; MIDALTITUDE MOUNTAINS; SUBSURFACE EROSION; INTERNAL EROSION; COLLAPSED PIPES; BARDENAS REALES; BADLAND AREAS; EBRO BASIN	Soil piping is a widespread, although often overlooked land degradation process. So far, subsurface soil erosion studies have been focused on the importance of soil piping in hydrological and geomorphological processes, and factors controlling piping processes. Nowadays, the environmental changes being caused by the Anthropocene have clearly demonstrated that society depends on soil more than ever before, so the traditional studies of soil erosion processes need to be redefined. In that sense, geomorphologists face to overcome new piping-related problems. In this article we identify new possible areas of research: (i) soil pipes and pipe collapses (PCs) as natural hazards, (ii) role of soil piping in carbon cycle, (iii) soil pipes and PCs and their relationships with biodiversity, and (iv) piping-affected areas as geodiversity sites. Only better recognition of natural hazards driven by soil piping, such as land subsidence and degradation, landslides, flooding and off-site sediment effects may result in better prevention and control measures in piping-affected areas. Moreover, in the context of Global Change the role of soil piping in carbon cycle should be raised. Land-use and land-cover changes, as well as climate change may affect piping dynamics in different morphoclimatic regions and soil loss due to piping may lead to carbon loss. Soil pipes and PCs are closely interlinked with biodiversity, both positively and negatively. Piping erosion may directly and indirectly destroy vegetation and animals, although in some cases piping erosion may create new habitats and provide favourable conditions for some species. However, soil piping is not only an environmental and societal problem, but it may also contribute to the world geodiversity, which is clearly observed in badland sites. Piping erosion may have a significant impact on environment and society, thus further research with new questions is essential to provide knowledge for sustainable development.

We use three climate models provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathways scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to assess the trends and spatial behavior of six atmospheric and ocean variables in the Caribbean Basin during the twenty-first century. Atmospheric results are reported from the model ensemble; however oceanic results are reported from ACCESS1.0 model, as its resolution captures mesoscale processes which are important for regional sea level projections. Surface atmospheric pressure and wind do not show significant trends. On the contrary, air and sea surface temperature, surface salinity, and mean sterodynamic sea level have coherent positive trends in the Caribbean Basin, which increase with a greater RCP scenario. Air temperature will probably increase by 2 degrees C over the preindustrial period during the century. Moreover, sea surface temperature is expected to rise between 1.92 degrees and 3.01 degrees C in the 1976-2005 to 2071-2100 period. The Caribbean Sea warming will have the potential to extend the hurricane season, increase the frequency of tropical storms, and intensify coral bleaching events. In the same period, mean sterodynamic sea level is expected to rise in the basin between 32.53 and 43.25 cm, depending on the RCP scenario used. The strongest trend expected in 2005-2100 is 50.84 +/- 1.48 cm cy(-1) under RCP8.5 scenario. Furthermore, the trends appear to accelerate since the last century in the basin. Besides, sterodynamic sea level rise would account for slightly over half of the total sea level rise in the Caribbean, after land-ice melting among other contributions not accounted by CMIP5 models are included. These trends have the potential to exacerbate flooding and erosion, putting at risk coastal areas, including low-elevation islands such as some in the San Andres and Providencia Archipelago.

The main objective of their research work is to understand the complex glacial-climate system during late-Holocene. They attempted a novel multi proxy approach for paleoclimate reconstruction but their work suffers from misinterpretation of various proxies and erroneous/misleading discussion. We therefore report following major points in this comment article. (1)Misinterpretation of magnetic parameters: Magnetic susceptibility (chi lf) has been used to interpret changes in magnetic mineralogy rather than concentration of magnetic minerals. Susceptibility of anhysteretic remanence (chi ARM) has been used at several places to indicate presence of superparamagnetic (SP) and multi domain (MD) ferrimagnetic particles rather than single domain (SD) ferrimagnetic (magnetite) particles. Interpreting erroneous negative values of percentage of frequency dependent susceptibility (chi fd%) for climate change. (2)Poor chronology: Overlaps in ages of glacial-lake sediments. (3)References: Several statements in paper have not been referenced and some of them have out of place citations. (4)Carefree writing: Authors have shown typical example of carefree writing of a research article, for example, giving units to dimensionless parameter S-ratio, and chi fd%, differences in units of chi lf in text and figure, different depths for the same age in text and figure. (5)Over interpretation: Authors at places have interpreted climatic variations based on only one sample. (6)Poor justifications: Authors did not provide any detailed justification for proxy data while interpreting climatic variations. (7) No data (results) on mineralogy and trace elements were given. Overall it is not only a problem of presentation and misinterpretation of proxy data but the study also fails to deliver the final message of climate change and glacier dynamics in the central Himalaya.

Their important ecosystem services at local and regional scope are currently threatened by climate and land use changes. Recent studies in these ecosystems suggest their importance to the provision of climate regulation services, prompting a better understanding of the underlying functions and their variability at ecosystem scales. The objective of this study is to determine the variability of methane (CH4) fluxes and carbon (C) sequestration within a tropical alpine peatland in three locations along a microtopographic gradient and its associated plant diversity. These locations accounted for: 1) hummocks, found mostly near the edge of the peat with a water table below the soil surface, 2) lawns, in the transition zone, with a water-table near the soil surface, and 3) hollows, permanently flooded with a water table above the soil surface, composed of small patches of open water intermingled with unconsolidated hummocks that surface the water level. Results indicate that CH4 flux is lowest in the lawns, while C sequestration is highest. Conversely, the hummock and hollow have higher CH4 flux and lower C sequestration. In addition, plant diversity in the lawns is higher than in the hummock and hollow location. Dryer conditions brought by current climate change in the northern Andes are expected to lower the water tables in the peatland. This change is expected to drive a change in CH4 flux and C sequestration at the lawns, currently dominating the peatland, towards values more similar to those measured in the hummocks. This decrease may also represent a change towards the lower plant diversity that characterized the hummock.

Indicators of climate risk in the UK at different levels of warming	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Heat extremes; Wildfire; Drought; Flood; Agricultural impacts; 4 degree world; 2 degree world	IMPACTS; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; WEATHER; INDEXES	Assessments of the impacts of climate change are typically made using climate scenarios based on assumptions about future emissions of greenhouse gases, but policymakers and climate risk communicators are increasingly asking for information on impacts at different levels of warming. This paper provides this information for a set of indicators of climate risks in the UK for levels of warming up to 4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The results show substantial increases in climate risks at 2 degrees C, which is often inferred in the media to be a 'safe' level of climate change. In a 2 degrees C world, the chance of a heatwave is doubled, and the frequency of heat stress affecting people, crops and animals can be increased by a factor of five. Cooling degree days more than double, wildfire danger can increase by 40%-70%, the frequency of agricultural and water resources droughts doubles in England, and flood frequency in Wales increases by 50%. At 4 degrees C the increases in risk are considerably greater: heatwaves occur in virtually every year. The frequency of cold weather extremes reduces, but is not eliminated, with increasing warming. The rate of change in an indicator with warming varies across the UK. For temperature-based indicators this reflects variability in current climate, but for rainfall-based indicators reflects variations in the change in climate. Most indicators show a generally linear increase in risk with level of warming (although the change in risk from now is around 2.4 times higher in a 4 degrees C world than a 2 degrees C world because of warming experienced so far). However, some indicators-particularly relating to heat extremes-show a highly non-linear increase with level of warming. The range in change in indicator at a given level of warming is primarily caused by uncertainty in the estimated regional response of to increasing forcing.

Given the increasing influence of human activities and climate change on this critical downstream control, understanding its effects on the evolution of the longitudinal profile is imperative. A general theoretical framework is proposed to quantify the relevant effects, which is tested by numerical experiment and compared with field, numerical and laboratory data from the literature. The results suggest the existence of a critical ratio of accommodation space to sediment supply of approximately 0.5, above which the typical concave upward profile tends to form. Further analyses show that sea level rise tends to increase the concavity of the longitudinal profile of a river with a relatively low equilibrium bed slope and progradation rate. Plain Language Summary As a key feature of a river, the bed level along the river, i.e., the river longitudinal profile, affects flooding, navigation, etc., and thus greatly influences human societies and natural ecosystems. However, the effects of the seaward progradation of a river mouth on the evolution of the river longitudinal profile are still unclear. Given the increasing influence of human activities and climate change on this critical downstream control, understanding these effects becomes imperative. A new theoretical framework incorporating the effects of river mouth progradation on the evolution of a river longitudinal profile is developed and tested by numerical experiments, field observations, and numerical and laboratory data from the literature. The results show that the seaward progradation of a river mouth could potentially lead to the formation of a concave river longitudinal profile. Specifically, we found that there exists a critical condition in which the sediment supply is insufficient to balance the seaward progradation of the river mouth, causing the typical concave upward longitudinal profile to form. The proposed theoretical framework further suggests that sea level rise tends to increase the concavity of the longitudinal profile for river with a relatively low equilibrium bed slope and progradation rate.

Precipitation-drainage cycles lead to hot moments in soil carbon dioxide dynamics in a Neotropical wet forest	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						CO(2)outgassing; CO(2)response to precipitation; Costa Rica; drought; El Nino; La Selva Biological Station; soil CO(2)transport modeling; tortuosity; tropical soil CO(2)emissions	CO2 EFFLUX; RAIN-FOREST; LA-SELVA; TROPICAL FORESTS; N-MINERALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; FLUXES; NET; ALLOCATION; CLIMATE	Soil CO(2)concentrations and emissions from tropical forests are modulated seasonally by precipitation. However, subseasonal responses to meteorological events (e.g., storms, drought) are less well known. Here, we present the effects of meteorological variability on short-term (hours to months) dynamics of soil CO(2)concentrations and emissions in a Neotropical wet forest. We continuously monitored soil temperature, moisture, and CO(2)for a three-year period (2015-2017), encompassing normal conditions, floods, a dry El Nino period, and a hurricane. We used a coupled model (Hydrus-1D) for soil water propagation, heat transfer, and diffusive gas transport to explain observed soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil CO(2)concentration responses to meteorology, and we estimated soil CO(2)efflux with a gradient-flux model. Then, we predicted changes in soil CO(2)concentrations and emissions under different warming climate change scenarios. Observed short-term (hourly to daily) soil CO(2)concentration responded more to precipitation than to other meteorological variables (including lower pressure during the hurricane). Observed soil CO(2)failed to exhibit diel patterns (associated with diel temperature fluctuations in drier climates), except during the drier El Nino period. Climate change scenarios showed enhanced soil CO(2)due to warmer conditions, while precipitation played a critical role in moderating the balance between concentrations and emissions. The scenario with increased precipitation (based on a regional model projection) led to increases of +11% in soil CO(2)concentrations and +4% in soil CO(2)emissions. The scenario with decreased precipitation (based on global circulation model projections) resulted in increases of +4% in soil CO(2)concentrations and +18% in soil CO(2)emissions, and presented more prominent hot moments in soil CO(2)outgassing. These findings suggest that soil CO(2)will increase under warmer climate in tropical wet forests, and precipitation patterns will define the intensity of CO(2)outgassing hot moments.

S.; Sebastian, Leocadio			Modeling ENSO impact on rice production in the Mekong River Delta	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SIMULATION-MODEL; TIME-SERIES; VIETNAM; SYSTEM; SAR; VARIABILITY; RISKS; YIELD	The Mekong River Delta is the rice production hub in South-east Asia and has a key role in determining rice prices in the world market. The increasing variability in the local climate due to global climate changes and the increasing severity of the ENSO phenomenon threatens rice production in the region, which has consequences for local and global food security. Though existing mapping efforts delineate the consequences of saline water intrusion during El Nino and flooding events during La Nina in the basin, research to predict future impacts in rice production is rather limited. The current work uses ORYZA, an ecophysiological model, combined with historical climate data, climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and 8.5 and climate-related risk maps to project the aggregate productivity and rice production impacts by the year 2050. Results show that in years of average salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop in the MRD would experience an average annual decrease of 720,450 tons for 2020-2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario compared to the baseline of 2005-2016 average and another 1.17 million tons under the RCP8.5 scenario. The autumn-winter crop would decrease by 331,480 tons under RCP4.5 and 462,720 tons under RCP8.5. In years of severe salinity intrusion and flooding, the winter-spring rice crop would decrease by 2.13 million tons (10.29% lower than the projection for an average year) under RCP4.5 and 2.5 million tons (13.62%) under RCP8.5. Under severe conditions, the autumn-winter crop would have an average decrease of 1.3 million tons (7.36%) under RCP4.5 and 1.4 million tons (10.88%) for the RCP8.5 scenario. Given that most of the rice produced in this area is exported, a decline in rice supply at this scale would likely have implications on the global market price of rice affecting global food security. Such decline will also have implications for the rural economy and food security of Vietnam. Suggestions for corrective measures to reduce the impacts are briefly discussed.

For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.

It is often financially unviable to remediate the asset but the residual risk must still be mitigated. Remote condition monitoring (RCM) is traditionally used in longer-term studies of geotechnical asset failure using satellite and airborne comparison techniques. However, this paper focuses on the use of RCM as a safety mitigation measure to provide early warning of localised rapid earthworks failure in order to halt train movements or prompt further investigation. The inaccessible nature of the railway network provides unique challenges to the successful monitoring of infrastructure, including limited power source availability and communications. Two case studies are presented - Gillingham tunnel, Dorset, and a centralised pilot study aimed at standardising geotechnical RCM across Network Rail.

This study describes an experimental prototype of a technologi-cally advanced multilayer green roof installed in a Mediterranean urban area (i.e., Palermo, Italy) and explores the results of an analysis of data collected over a one-year monitoring period by a complex sensors network. Multilayer green roofs, or "blue-green" roofs (BGRs), are characterized by a high water retention capacity compared to traditional green roofs due to the presence of an additional storage layer (blue layer), usually equipped with a valve that allows for regulating discharge outflow and water storage. Due to their recent development, BGRs are still scarcely explored in literature and have never been tested before in semi-arid en-vironments, where they could represent valid measures to counter possible climate change and growing ur-banization effects. In this study, the hydrological effectiveness of the experimental BGR is quantitatively evaluated by using appropriate indicators, based on the comparison between the hydrological response of the system and an equal size benchmark "grey" roof. The analyses are prevalently focused on the system's stormwater retention function, also investigating the relative contributions of the green layer and the storage layer to the overall retention capacity through the introduction of new BGRs specific indicators. Results emphasize the high impact of storms characteristics, antecedent soil moisture of the green layer, and initial water storage in the blue layer on the system's retention capacity. The overall mean retention rate for the experimental BGR, on average equal to 77% at the daily scale and 61% at the event scale, is comparable to the typical values of traditional extensive green roofs and could be further improved through a "retention-oriented" management of the outflow valve. The system was able to entirely retain almost half of the rainfall events occurred during the monitoring period and, for all the others, it was however extremely effective in reducing runoff peaks and delaying the hydrograph produced.

Establishing the timing of this transitional period in northeastern British Columbia provides constraints on the rate in which the biomes adapted during this interval of rapid climate change. Preserved aeolian landforms (geomorphic) and macrofossil assemblages (biological) are complementary proxies for interpreting climate amelioration. Paraglacial aeolian dunes in the Kiskatinaw dune field developed following the retreat of glacial Lake Peace which formed after the separation of the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. These parabolic sand dunes are vegetation-anchored landforms that indicate plant colonization bio-morphologically influenced aeolian activity during stabilization. Optical dating established that stabilization occurred about 10.8 +/- 0.3 ka ago (weighted mean of six ages), around the same time interval in which vegetation transitioned from herb and shrub tundra to forest tundra, then to a boreal parkland. Radiocarbon ages from macrofossil assemblages at the Flatbed River section infer paraglacial conditions likely persisted to around 12 000 cal yrs BP and the site had characteristics of a forest tundra. At that time, the Flatbed River was a dry floodplain that transitioned to a pond setting in a boreal parkland after 12 447-11 941 cal yrs BP and before 11 690-11 279 cal yrs BP. The site transitioned from pond to bog after 10 149-9771 cal yrs BP, coincident with the onset of boreal forest conditions that were established by 9901-9607 cal yrs BP. Biome succession recorded at the Flatbed River section and the stabilization of sand dunes indicates that the site transitioned from a paraglacial setting associated with tundra to a non-glacial setting characterized by a boreal forest environment over approximately 2 ka (ca. 12.0-9.7 ka ago). However, the change from tundra to parkland forest conditions took <500 years (ca. 12.0-11.5 ka ago). This suggests that climate warming enabled a rapid transition from cold dry tundra to parkland forests in as little time as few centuries. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As this is not a linear trend but rather by singularities and anomalies including a broad spectrum of climatic and weather extremes with high temporal and spatial uncertainty focused avoidance strategies are difficult to prepare. However, the effects of climate change are mostly addressed with outdated 'business as usual' approaches by governments and most stakeholders, which are unfit to tackle the complexity of current challenges. Coping action for natural hazards is mostly undertaken during and after such events compensating damage through payments and restoration. In the future, pro-active nature-based solutions are needed for risk mitigation and avoiding severe damage through enhancing all facets of biodiversity from species richness, structural roughness, to spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems. This will not avoid extreme weather events, but it will reduce the damage of increasingly appearing natural hazards. However, this strategy cannot be implemented all of a sudden. Long-term and spatial concepts are needed. For this purpose, currently missing governance structures based on geographical, geoscientific, ecological, meteorological, and societal expertise should be installed. In recent years, a good scientific and knowledge basis for the required solutions has been developed, which now must translate into action. Here, a series of suggestions is compiled for a broad spectrum of extreme events and societal fields, which is far from being complete but should stimulate critically needed creativity and commitment. Nature-based solutions will not deliver a complete protection and cannot be the only kind of action, but we can no longer rely on post-disaster compensation or on the safety illusion of mere engineering and construction works. The efficiency of biodiversity as an insurance for maintaining ecosystem services is well understood. The implementation of nature-based adaptation, coping, and protection measures is less expensive than traditional end-of-the-pipe constructions. It requires an in-depth understanding of interacting processes and trans-disciplinary cooperation based on a broad acceptance in the public. Investments into these solutions would pay off, not tomorrow, but in the future. It is the best sustainable and feasible approach for disaster prevention.

Even though it is well documented in marine archives, a detailed reconstruction of the Pliocene-Pleistocene climatic evolution of Central Europe is hampered by a general lack of data. The work presented here is based on sedimentary material from drill cores obtained at three sites within the Heidelberg Basin (Germany). The scientific relevance of this unique archive was discovered only in the last decade. The hundreds of metres thick sequences of mainly fluvial sediments record the evolution of the environment and climatic conditions during the late Pliocene and the entire Pleistocene of western Central Europe. In our present study, we implement unpublished mineral magnetic S-ratio data, and new evidence from X-ray analysis into two previously completed studies on the magnetic polarity stratigraphy, and the magnetic mineralogy of the Pliocene to Pleistocene sediments of the Heidelberg Basin. The total set of data enables distinction of environmental and climatic processes, and unveil details on the climatic conditions of continental Europe during this period. We demonstrate the dominance of a warm climate with alternation of humid and dry periods during the Pliocene. Cyclic variations in the groundwater table in the Rhine flood plain resulted in redox fluctuations, which led to the decomposition of the primary detrital mineral assemblage. Authigenic Fe oxides, particularly haematite, formed during dry periods. A rapid transition into cooler and moister conditions occurred at the end of the Pliocene, as indicated by the persistence of Fe sulphides, especially greigite. A high groundwater table and the associated reducing conditions have largely persisted to the present day. We show that the rapid transition from warm to cooler and moister climatic conditions in Central Europe during the final Pliocene is a regional response to the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG). This work supplements existing knowledge of the climatic evolution of Central Europe during the PliocenePleistocene transition by data from a region from which little data has been available. A sideglance to climatic archives elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., North Atlantic Ocean, Chinese Loess Plateau, Russian arctic) is used to show the coincidence of the iNHG events in quite different environmental regimes.

An understanding of human ecology can be gained when the archaeological record is placed within the context of dynamic landscape changes and alterations in natural resource availability. We reconstructed the landscape evolution of the Quebrada Mani fan complex, situated along the west-facing slope of the Central Andes in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, an area that contains an archaeological record that spans almost 13,000 years. Surficial geologic mapping and dating of three 2-12 km(2) study sites, in conjunction with archaeological records and analysis of remotely sensed data for the similar to 400 km(2) fan complex, was conducted to reconstruct the landscape evolution and the way of life of Paleoindian (ca. 12.8-11.5 ka) and early/late Formative (ca 2.5 to 0.7 ka) social groups. Just prior to any known human occupation, a large pluvial event in the high Andes, regionally referred to as CAPE I, impacted the Quebrada Mani fan complex from ca.18-16.5 ka. During CAPE I, the Mani fan complex was dominated by perennial stream systems that deposited well-sorted conglomerates in the upper reaches of the fan (Unit T2) and perennial wetlands (Unit B1). This pluvial period was followed by the onset of an extreme drought sometime after 15 ka, but before 13 ka, when wetlands desiccated and the distal reaches of the fan deflated. Sand sheets and sand dunes were deposited across broad reaches of the landscape and Quebrada Mani incised 3-5 m into its floodplain. This drought had profound implications for the distribution of natural resources during the subsequent pluvial event (CAPE II) that ensued from ca. 12.5-9.5 ka. Incision along the upper reaches of the fan caused a more restricted floodplain and allowed the deposition of extensive wetlands along the more distal central reaches of the fan where groundwater emerged. Paleoindian residential open-air camps were placed in these areas. Wetlands were replaced by a tree-covered floodplain during the latter portion of this pluvial event (ca. 10.5-9 ka). We found no archaeological evidence for human occupations between similar to 8-2.5 ka, suggesting a lack of natural resources and/or very low hunter-gatherer population densities. During this time, Quebrada Mani incised up to 8 m into the floodplain. Mudflow deposition - typical of the present-day fan complex - initiated around 2.5 ka, likely responding to an increase in precipitation. This triggered a re-population of the fan surface by Formative agricultural groups that irrigated and extensively farmed these flood-plains. By the end of the Formative, these socio-cultural groups became increasingly vulnerable to climatic changes as cut-and-fill cycles in the drainage necessitated major infrastructure adjustments, until the technologies and social-cultural convention of the epoch could not cope with environmental change and investments were abandoned by similar to 0.8 ka.

Traditional farming methods that prioritize a single objective, such as increasing crop yield, reducing irrigation water consumption, or minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have proven to be insufficient. Simultaneously optimizing multiple competing rice farming objectives remains less explored. The present study aimed to increase current rice yield, reduce irrigation water consumption, and tackle the dilemma to reduce GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions at once. Using a heuristic and holistic method, we optimized farm management, focusing on irrigation regimes, sowing window, fertilization rate, tillage depth, and their interactions. We calibrated and validated the process-based DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model with 5 years of eddy covariance observations in a rice paddy site. The DNDC model was integrated with a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Results show that current farm management practices have failed to achieve the potential yield and imposed high environmental costs in the form of water use (604-810 mm/yr) and GHG emissions (CH4: 186-220 kg C/ha/yr; N2O: 0.3-1.6 kg C/ha/yr). By contrast, our new approach suggested that the optimized management could maintain or even increase current crop yield to its potential (-10 t/ha), while reducing irrigation demand and GHG emissions by >50 %. Our results suggest that earlier sowing, combined with improved irrigation practices, may play a crucial role in maximizing crop yield and potentially providing environmental benefits. We found that the optimal proportion of non-flooded days was around 54 % of the growing season length, and the optimal stage for non-flooding days was the vegetative stage. Our approach could further be applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of farming systems under various climate and local conditions, and to guide poli-cymaking and farming practices.

Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics.

However, under the complex climate system, the driving mechanisms behind hydroclimatic variability in terms of timescales and magnitude are still unclear, and the various ecological responses are not clear. Here, we reconstruct the history of swamp evolution and climate changes in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the Holocene based on multi-proxy data (palynomorphs, microscopic charcoal, diatoms, grain size, total organic carbon, C/N ratio, and delta C-13(TOC) data). The climatic conditions in the study area gradually became cold and dry due to the weakening East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) after ca. 5400 cal yr BP, as evidenced by the shift in vegetation communities from temperate broad-leaved forests dominated by Quercus to mixed conifer and deciduous broad-leaved forests with increased cold/dry-tolerant taxa. After ca. 4700 cal yr BP, microscopic charcoal concentration to terrestrial pollen concentration values are relatively high together with a sharp decrease in palynomorph concentrations and the proportions of arboreal pollen, representing open forest with fewer plants due to frequent wildfires. In addition, the quasi-millennial frequencies of seasonal fires (dry spring) and flooding (summer rainfall) were identified in our study area during the Late Holocene, which correspond to lower sea surface temperatures of the western tropical Pacific and stronger El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity periods. After ca. 8200 cal yr BP, the depositional environment underwent gradual backswamp expansion due to high precipitation, strengthened EASM, and relative sea-level rise during the Early to Middle Holocene. During the Late Holocene, ENSO-driven extreme hydroclimatic variability, such as frequent flooding and fire, had significant impacts on not only swamp development with large fluctuations in water level but also long-term vegetation and aquatic ecosystem dynamics.

We show how research combining hydrological measurement, geophysics and isotopes, together with nutrient speciation techniques provides insight on nitrogen pathways and transformations that could not have been captured otherwise, including a zone of vertical preferential discharge of nitrate from deeper groundwater, and a zone of rapid denitrification linking the floodplain with the riverbed. Nitrate attenuation in the reach is dominated by denitrification but is spatially highly variable. This variability is driven by groundwater flow pathways and landscape setting, which influences hyporheic flow, residence time and nitrate removal. We observed the spatial connectivity of the river to the riparian zone is important because zones of horizontal preferential discharge supply organic matter from the floodplain and create anoxic riverbed conditions with overlapping zones of nitrification potential and denitrification activity that peaked 10-20 cm below the riverbed. Our data also show that temporal variability in water pathways in the reach is driven by changes in stage of the order of tens of centimetres and by strength of water flux, which may influence the depth of delivery of dissolved organic carbon. The temporal variability is sensitive to changes to river flows under UK climate projections that anticipate a 14%-15% increase in regional median winter rainfall and a 14%-19% reduction in summer rainfall. Superimposed on seasonal projections is more intensive storm activity that will likely lead to a more dynamic and inherently complex (hydrologically and biogeochemically) hyporheic zone. We recorded direct evidence of suppression of upwelling groundwater (flow reversal) during rainfall events. Such flow reversal may fuel riverbed sediments whereby delivery of organic carbon to depth, and higher denitrification rates in HEFs might act in concert to make nitrate removal in the riverbed more efficient.

However, knowledge of adaptive strategies and the underlying mechanisms is lacking for the majority of taxa, especially those living in habitats sensitive to climate change. Here, we investigated 20 populations of a Tertiary-relict tree species, Eaptelea pleiospermum (Eupteleaceae), scattered in a mountain riparian habitat in China. We integrated genetic, growth, and reproductive traits, and evaluated the relative contributions of climatic and soil factors on genetic and functional trait divergence. The E pleiospermurn populations were divided into south and north genetic clusters, and there were significant differences in leaf density and seed mass of adult trees between the two. The spatial pattern of genetic divergence resulted from effects of both isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE), whereas the divergence of growth and reproductive traits resulted solely from IBE effects. Spatial distance and selection by temperalure and soils played dominant roles in genetic divergence. Precipitation drove he spatial divergence of sprouling. Both divergence of leaf density and seed mass were prominently induced by genetic divergence, and the influences might be enhanced by LemperaLure and soil nutrienis. We infer that E. pleiuspennum populations adopt a resource-conservalive strategy with low growth rates and higher sprouLing under flooding disturbance, with larger seeds for improved seedling recruitmenl. at lower lathucles. In contrast, high growth rare and sexual reproduction with small seeds are strategies adopted by populations al higher lathucles. We conclude Lhal sprouting ref-leas a plaslic response Lo precipiLiLion, and leaf densiLy and seed mass reflect local adaplion under selection by temperature and soil factors.The underlying mechanisms of species adaptation strategies were traitspecific.

One solution is to switch between resource-intensive behaviors. Such phenotypic plasticity is one strategy that organisms use to funnel resources from one expensive trait to another. In crickets (Gryllus texensis), the development and maintenance of flight muscles reduce resource availability for reproduction, leading to physiological trade-offs between the two traits. Long-winged female G. texensis can histolyze their wing muscles, resulting in increased egg production, but they can then no longer fly. Using a diet that mimics food availability in the field, we found that long-winged females adopted one of the three following strategies: early reproduction, intermediate reproduction, and late reproduction. Some late reproducers maintained their flight capability until the end of their natural life span and laid few eggs. If females lost the ability to fly (i.e., their hind wings are removed), they laid eggs earlier, leading to increased reproductive output. However, other environmental cues (e.g., an increased number of mates, increased oviposition substrate quality, or a bout of dispersal flight) had no effect. Late-reproducing females laid 96% fewer eggs than early reproducers, suggesting that late reproduction exacts a huge fitness cost. Nevertheless, some females maintain their flight muscles to the end of their natural life span in both the lab and the field. We suggest that the ability to fly allows for bet hedging against an environmental catastrophe (e.g., drought or flood). This benefit may help explain the persistence of late-reproducing long-winged females, despite the cost of this choice. As climate change increases drought and flood in Texas, late dispersal may be one factor that helps this species survive in the future. An increased understanding of factors that maintain seemingly low fitness strategies can help us predict the resilience of species under climate change.

J	Mallakpour, I; Sadegh, M; AghaKouchak, A				Mallakpour, Iman; Sadegh, Mojtaba; AghaKouchak, Amir			Changes in the exposure of California's levee-protected critical infrastructure to flooding hazard in a warming climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						California's levees; climate change; flood hazard; critical infrastructure	EXTREME-VALUE ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; STREAMFLOW; RISK; PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; RUNOFF; VULNERABILITY; HYDROLOGY; CURVES	Levee systems are an important part of California's water infrastructure, engineered to provide resilience against flooding and reduce flood losses. The growth in California is partly associated with costly infrastructure developments that led to population expansion in the levee protected areas. Therefore, potential changes in the flood hazard could have significant socioeconomic consequences over levee protected areas, especially in the face of a changing climate. In this study, we examine the possible impacts of a warming climate on flood hazard over levee protected land in California. We use gridded maximum daily runoff from global circulation models (GCMs) that represent a wide range of variability among the climate projections, and are recommended by the California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment Report, to investigate possible climate-induced changes. We also quantify the exposure of several critical infrastructure protected by the levee systems (e.g. roads, electric power transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, petroleum pipelines, and railroads) to flooding. Our results provide a detailed picture of change in flood risk for different levees and the potential societal consequences (e.g. exposure of people and critical infrastructure). Levee systems in the northern part of the Central Valley and coastal counties of Southern California are likely to observe the highest increase in flood hazard relative to the past. The most evident change is projected for the northern region of the Central Valley, including Butte, Glenn, Yuba, Sutter, Sacramento, and San Joaquin counties. In the leveed regions of these counties, based on the model simulations of the future, the historical 100-year runoff can potentially increase up to threefold under RCP8.5. We argue that levee operation and maintenance along with emergency preparation plans should take into account the changes in frequencies and intensities of flood hazard in a changing climate to ensure safety of levee systems and their protected infrastructure.

This information can help to explore the impacts of extreme drought or flood on crop production, which can provide implications for the adaptation of agriculture to higher-probability extreme climate in the context of global warming. In this paper, reported extreme drought/flood chronologies and reconstructed grain harvest series derived from historical documents were adopted in order to investigate the association between the reported frequency of extreme drought/flood in eastern China and reconstructed poor harvests during 801-1910. The results show that extreme droughts were reported more often in 801-870, 1031-1230, 1481-1530, and 1581-1650 over the whole of eastern China. On a regional scale, extreme droughts were reported more often in 1031-1100, 1441-1490, 1601-1650, and 1831-1880 in the North China Plain, 801-870, 1031-1120, 1161-1220, and 1471-1530 in Jianghuai, and 991-1040, 1091-1150, 1171-1230, 1411-1470, and 1481-1530 in Jiangnan. The grain harvest was reconstructed to be generally poor in 801-940, 1251-1650, and 1841-1910, but the reconstructed harvests were bumper in 951-1250 and 1651-1840, approximately. During the entire period from 801 to 1910, the frequency of reporting of extreme droughts in any subregion of eastern China was significantly associated over the long term with lower reconstructed harvests. The association between reported frequency of extreme floods and reconstructed low harvests appeared to be much weaker, while reconstructed harvest was much worse when extreme drought and extreme flood in different subregions were reported in the same year. The association between reconstructed poor harvests and reported frequency of regional extreme droughts was weak during the warm epoch of 920-1300 but strong during the cold epoch of 1310-1880, which could imply that a warm climate could weaken the impact of extreme drought on poor harvests; yet other historical factors may also contribute to these different patterns extracted from the two datasets.

However, most CSS in mega-estuaries of the world are facing great challenges from serious risk of degradation due to intensive human activities and sea-level rise. Here, we focus on the tradeoff between the Biandan Shoal (BDS) and Xinqiao Channel (XQC), which is the largest CSS of the South Branch, Changjiang Estuary. The results show that the BDS area above the 5 m water depth had an observable increasing tendency with an interannual increasing rate of 1.43 km(2)/yr during 1996-2016. The corresponding XQC volume exhibited an obvious reduction trend with an annual decreasing rate of 3.79 x 10(6) m(3)/yr. Meanwhile, the BDS presented lateral and downward extension with more than 4.7 km of downward movement, while the XQC indicated shrinking with the width of the upper reaches decreasing by nearly half since 1998. Furthermore, the morphodynamic evolution of the BDS-XQC system during 1998-2016 could be divided into four stages: preflood stage with the joint extension of the BDS and XQC (1996-1998); conversion stage due to impacts from the extreme flood (1998-2000); development stage with obvious deposition throughout the system (2000-2009); stabilization stage with deposition on the high flats but no lateral expansion of the BDS, and continuous shrinkage of the XQC (2009-2016). The dynamic balance of the BDS-XQC system was mainly determined by the tradeoffs between the BDS and XQC, even though the occasional extreme hydrological events disrupted the coupling of the BDS-XQC. Meanwhile, the local channel blocked by the construction of the Dongfengxisha Reservoir induced a decrease in water discharge into the XQC, which was responsible for the recent XQC recession. In light of the impact of future climate change and increasing human interference in the anthropogenic era, fragile CSS distributed in estuaries should be holistically considered with policies to support sustainable integrated coastal zone management.

Understanding the spatial characteristic and the key influencing factors of urban waterlogging has significant implications for mitigating waterlogging. In this study, the officially issued representative waterlogging points were obtained, as well as the topographic factors and land cover characteristics were selected to compare their impacts on the waterlogging event density in a highly urbanized area at urban functional zone (UFZ) scale, and to quantify the contributions of the key influencing factors on urban waterlogging events. Results showed the average density of urban waterlogging events in the study area is 9.2 points/km2, and 38.4 % of the waterlogging events are distributed in REZ. The distribution of waterlogging points in the study area revealed a significant multi-core and multilevel spatial aggregation pattern, and 12.1 % of the study area was high-density waterlogging area. In the total UFZs, the correlation coefficients of topographic indices with waterlogging density were relatively weaker than the other land cover characteristic metrics. The impervious surface ratio had significant contributions in all UFZ types. The larger ratio of impervious surface significantly increased the density of waterlogging events. The increase in the ratio of green space can effectively decrease the density of urban waterlogging. In the total UFZs, the top 3 key influencing factors of urban waterlogging were PR (35.9 %), COHESION (32.5 %) and DIVISION (11.8 %). The higher connectivity of landscape patches in REZ, INZ and COZ, as well as the increase of landscape dispersion or diversity in REZ, EGZ, INZ and GSZ can effectively reduce the occurrence of urban waterlogging. This study provides a better understanding of the formation mechanism of urban waterlogging disasters and potential implications for prioritized waterlogging mitigation strategies.

J	Marino, D; Palmieri, M; Marucci, A; Soraci, M; Barone, A; Pili, S				Marino, Davide; Palmieri, Margherita; Marucci, Angelo; Soraci, Mariangela; Barone, Antonio; Pili, Silvia			Linking Flood Risk Mitigation and Food Security: An Analysis of Land-Use Change in the Metropolitan Area of Rome	LAND			English	Article						flood mitigation ES; runoff retention; agricultural production; food security; InVEST model; GIS	USE/LAND-COVER DYNAMICS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE; RUNOFF; DEFORESTATION; SYSTEMS; GIS	Land consumption and climate change have intensified natural disasters in urban areas. In response to these emergencies under the European 2030 Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals have been established to improve ecosystem protection and increase resilience and adaptation to natural disasters globally (Goal 13 "Climate action" and Goal 15 "Life on land"). In order to implement governance tools appropriately, it is necessary to know the relationships among the drivers, the changes in the state of urban ecosystems and agro-ecosystems, and the impact on the supply of goods and services at spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, Land-Use and Land-Cover Changes (LULCCs) in the metropolitan area of Rome have been investigated, with the purpose of detecting the synergistic variations in the supply of the flood mitigation and agricultural production ecosystem services (ES). The methodology is based on a GIS (Geographic Information System) analysis that identifies the transformation processes and permanencies related to land-cover. The variation in flood mitigation services was quantified through the use of the Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Model (UFRM) from the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) suite, while the variation in agricultural production through productivity coefficients was associated with changes in land-uses. Finally, an analysis of LULC-induced synergies and trade-offs between the two services was performed. The results show a net negative change in ES supply, caused mainly by urbanization at the expense of agricultural land. This decrease in ES supply is not offset by other LULCC transitions. In addition, the analysis of synergies and trade-offs between flood mitigation ES and agricultural production ES (in arable land, orchards, vineyards, and olive groves) shows that the reduction of agricultural land negatively affects both ES. The innovative contribution of this paper lies in setting an integrated methodology that is able to investigate how LULCC influences both hydraulic safety and food security. Findings can be useful to support planning of enhancing the role of agriculture in metropolitan areas.

The Ebro river Delta (Spain) is rep-resentative of coastal systems particularly vulnerable to SLR due to significant sediment retention behind up-stream dams (up to 99%), thereby dramatically reducing the capacity for deltaic sediment accretion. Rice production is the main economic activity, covering 66% of the delta area, and is negatively affected by SLR because of flooding and soil salinization. Therefore, appropriate adaptation measures are needed to preserve rice produc-tion. We combined Geographic Information Systems and Generalized Linear Models to identify zones prone to flooding and increasing soil salinity, and to calculate the so-called sediment deficit, that is the amount of sedi-ment needed to raise the land to compensate flooding and soil salinization. We modelled SLR scenarios predicted by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and analysed the economic feasibility (not the technical feasibility) of reintroducing fluvial sediments retained in the upstream river dam reservoirs into the delta plain, which can con-tribute to maintaining land elevation and rice production with SLR. To do this, the costs of the sediment reintro-duction measures and their benefits in terms of avoided loss of rice production income were evaluated with an approximate economic cost-benefit analysis. Results predicted that between 35 and 90% of the rice field area will be flooded in the best and worst SLR scenarios considered (SLR = 0.5 m and 1.8 m by 2100, respectively), with a sediment deficit of 130 and 442 million tonnes, with an associated cost of sediment reintroduction of 13 and 226 million euro . The net benefit of rice production maintenance was 24.6 and 328 euro /ha. The proposed ad-aptation measure has a positive effect on rice production and can be considered as an innovative management option for maintaining deltaic areas under SLR. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using 46 moderate- and high-resolution satellite images, including declassified Keyhole and Landsat missions between 1964 and 2020, we provide a comprehensive area mapping of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Tama Koshi (Rongxer) basin, a highly glacierized China-Nepal transnational catchment in the central Himalayas with high potential risks of glacier-related hazards. Results show that the 329.2 +/- 1.9 km(2) total area of 271 glaciers in the region has decreased by 26.2 +/- 3.2 km(2) in the past 56 years. During 2000-2016, remarkable ice mass loss caused the mean glacier surface elevation to decrease with a rate of -0.63 m a(-1), and the mean glacier surface velocity slowed by similar to 25% between 1999 and 2015. The total area of glacial lakes increased by 9.2 +/- 0.4 km(2) (similar to 180%) from 5.1 +/- 0.1 km(2) in 1964 to 14.4 +/- 0.3 km(2) in 2020, while ice-contacted proglacial lakes have a much higher expansion rate (similar to 204%). Large-scale glacial lakes are developed preferentially and experienced rapid expansion on the east side of the basin, suggesting that in addition to climate warming, the glacial geomorphological characters (aspect and slope) are also key controlling factors of the lake growing process. We hypothesize that lake expansion will continue in some cases until critical local topography (i.e., steepening icefall) is reached, but the lake number may not necessarily increase. Further monitoring should be focused on eight rapidly expanding proglacial lakes due to their high potential risks of failure and relatively high lake volumes.

In this study, we compiled the first complete rock glacier inventory for the Hunza Basin, western Karakoram, of 616 rock glaciers with an area of 194 km(2) between 2800 and 5700 ma.s.l. We categorized the rock glaciers as intact or relict, and their distributions and destabilization were further analyzed and used along with in situ climate and elevation dataset to model the permafrost probability distribution. The modeled areas where the permafrost zonation index (PZI) is 0.5-1.00 indicate that permafrost occurs over 85% of the catchment area and lies above 3525 ma.s.l., which closely matches the zero-degree isotherm of 3800 ma.s.l. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the independent variables, elevation is the most sensitive variable, followed by net radiation, for predicting the probabilities of the presence and absence of permafrost. The model distributions are quite precise, with median posterior areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.96 for model training and testing, respectively. We analyzed the rock glacier destabilization for 68 rock glaciers that interacted with river channels, of which 50 blocked or diverted river channels. Destabilized rock glaciers can be closely linked to the 0 degrees C isotherm between 3400 and 4600 m a.s.l. The significant damage caused by periodic floods from the subsequent blockage of river channels by landslides can be attributed to variations in permafrost. Which demolished infrastructure, including a hydropower plant, suspension bridge and water supply system in Hassan-abad catchment. Quantification of rock glacier dynamics and permafrost in the region can further improve policies related to the reduction in disaster risk and mitigation of associated hazards.

To accomplish this goal, we used 148 sets of 5-min rainfall rate data from the 1989-2015 period. The selected regions were the Jucar Hydrographic Confederation (CHJ) and the Internal Basins of Catalonia (CIC), which cover most of the autonomous communities of Catalonia and the Valencian Community (east Spain). The average 5-min intensity threshold of 35 mm/h and the beta parameter, defined as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period, were used to characterise convective precipitation. Convective episodes were categorised as "very convective", "moderately convective", and "slightly convective" based on the beta value. After quality control, the series of 129 stations were clustered into homogeneous precipitation zones that also include beta as one of the variables of characterisation. The results show that convective precipitation can contribute to total annual precipitation by up to 16% on average, but it is generated by a very small percentage of convective events (between 3% and 6% across all the stations) in comparison with the total number of rainfall episodes. In this sense, moderately convective events are the most common, with a predominantly unimodal monthly distribution of beta, with summer the most convective season. Trends show a significant increase in precipitation, convective precipitation, and convective episodes in the CHJ. On the other hand, a positive trend of convective events is predominant in the CIC region, despite an overall precipitation decrease in the analysed period. These results are relevant given that extreme daily rainfall does not show a positive or significant trend, and they are in line with the impact of climate change on increased atmospheric instability and water vapour in the atmosphere. They highlight the need to work with sub-daily precipitation series in the case of the Mediterranean, which is mainly affected by flash floods.

In Africa, a key barrier to interpreting rainfall changes is our limited understanding of water vapor transport across the continent. Here, we show that a series of nocturnal easterly Low-Level Jets (LLJs), which form in the valleys punctuating the East African rift system, transport the majority of water vapor to central Africa from the Indian Ocean. There is a robust connection between strengthened LLJs and drought in eastern and southern Africa at interannual timescales, mediated by an increase in low-level divergence and water vapor export. Analysis of climate model simulations at a wide range of resolutions (250-4.5 km) suggests that grid lengths <60 km are needed to simulate the salient structures of LLJs. The failure of coarse resolution models to capture LLJs is linked with biases in rainfall climatology and variability across the continent. Plain Language Summary Africa is one of the continents least responsible for climate change but will bear a disproportionate share of its impact, particularly through changes to droughts and floods. An important task for climate scientists is therefore to understand possible future changes to African rainfall. Unfortunately, this task is made difficult by large gaps in our knowledge of the basic mechanics of the climate system over Africa. One of these gaps is in our understanding of how water vapor-which is a key ingredient for rainfall-travels from the Indian Ocean into the African interior. Here, we show that over 200,000 tonnes of water vapor are transported each second through a series of invisible rivers, which flow through the atmosphere in valleys interrupting the high mountains of the East African Rift System. The models that we use to project rainfall change can capture the structure of these invisible rivers, but only if they represent the mountains of tropical Africa realistically.

Here we use heavy precipitation events from an atmospheric model that was run at different horizontal grid spacings (i.e., 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 2 km 4 km, and 12 km) and able to resolve different processes. Within an idealized simulation framework, these rainfall events are used as input to an operational distributed hydrologic model to evaluate the sensitivity of the hydrologic response to different forcing grid spacings. We consider the finest scale (i.e., 250 m) as reference, and compute event peak flows and volumes across a wide range of basin sizes. We find that the use of increasingly-coarser inputs leads to changes in the distribution of event peak flows and volumes, with the strongest sensitivity at the smallest catchment sizes. Our results show the compromise between computational cost and hydrologic performance, providing basic information for future endeavors geared towards regional downscaling.

While much research has sought to develop specific indicators that may serve as proxies for these considerations, less research has focused on those normative aspects of indicator design that support a variety of goals associated with the accuracy, reproducibility, proxy value and multi-stakeholder translation of indicators, among various other goals and values. This perspective article sets forth a range of potential considerations that may be useful for those who seek to design and develop novel resilience and adaptation indicators ("RAIs"). These considerations are explored through a range of hypothetical examples that may be applicable to coastal communities that seek to address the practical challenges facing the design, execution, management and modification of RAIs.

These changes have resulted in modifications of the rainfall regime in many Mediterranean regions. This work is based on monthly rainfall data from 17 stations located in the Tafna catchment (North West of Algeria). The study aim is to identify long-term (1970-2016) spatial and temporal trends in annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation, using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method. The approach is used to classify trends into "low", "medium", "high", which should be taken in consideration in future studies on floods ("high") and drought ("low"). The monthly rainfall shows a decreasing trend in all studied stations (100% of stations) during February, March, April, and May, the same phenomenon observed in the majority of stations for June, July (82% of stations), and December (58% of stations). Seasonal analysis indicates a downward trend in winter and spring. Using annual rainfall, the stations located in the north, west and central part of the Tafna show a decrease in rainfall (59% of stations).

However, little research has been done on the characteristics of extreme precipitation in different rice growth stages. Taking the South China region as a case study, the characteristics of extreme daily precipitation in the early rice season (April-July) from 1960 to 2009 were investigated by using percentile method. Results indicated that extreme precipitation threshold increases since the tillering stage, and there is big difference between the first and the rest growth stages. Extreme precipitation is serious in the eastern part than in the western part of South China during the seeding and tillering stage, and reverse since the booting stage. Frequency of extreme precipitation increases in recent decades after the booting stage. Finally, flood risk regions form more easily in the coastal cities and the western part of South China in the 1990s and 2000s since the tillering stage.

Optimal interventions for flood control, drainage and irrigation project improvements	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP); environmental sustainability; flood control; drainage and irrigation (FCDI); coastal floodplain management; water management interventions	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; DESIGN; MODELS; MANAGEMENT	A Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model is formulated and solved in this study to optimize environmental sustainability of flood control, drainage, and irrigation (FCDI) projects in the deltaic regions of Bangladesh. The model optimizes the value of integrated resource benefit, a dimensionless variable defined to measure the environmental sustainability based on the water, agricultural and ecological resources, with a set of project interventions being the major drivers. The resource benefits were evaluated with the help of several indicators, such as flood, navigability, salinity, waterlogging, cropping intensity, land loss and vegetation. The solution of MINLP model provided optimal values of the decision variables, which are the quantities of project interventions (e.g. length and height of dike, number of sluices and drainage inlets, lengths of drainage canals, erosion protection and afforestation works). The approach and the MINLP formulation presented in this study can be used for any real-life FCDI project improvements.

Maintaining Tropical Beaches with Seagrass and Algae: A Promising Alternative to Engineering Solutions	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						coastal erosion; nature-based engineering; ecosystem services; coastal protection; coastal management	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CARBONATE PRODUCTION; HALIMEDA-INCRASSATA; POSITIVE FEEDBACKS; SEDIMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACTS; WAVE; NOURISHMENT; DEPOSITION	Tropical beaches provide coastal flood protection, income from tourism, and habitat for flagship species. They urgently need protection from erosion, which is being exacerbated by changing climate and coastal development. Traditional coastal engineering solutions are expensive, provide unstable temporary solutions, and often disrupt natural sediment transport. Instead, natural foreshore stabilization and nourishment may provide a sustainable and resilient long-term solution. Field flume and ecosystem process measurements, along with data from the literature, show that sediment stabilization by seagrass in combination with sediment-producing calcifying algae in the foreshore form an effective mechanism for maintaining tropical beaches worldwide. The long-term efficacy of this type of nature-based beach management is shown at a large scale by comparing vegetated and unvegetated coastal profiles. We argue that preserving and restoring vegetated beach foreshore ecosystems offers a viable, self-sustaining alternative to traditional engineering solutions, increasing the resilience of coastal areas to climate change.

However, its trend is becoming more destructive and unpredictable in recent years, which tends to threaten peoples livelihood, properties, and health. This study attempted to examine the flood vulnerability among households in 14 districts of the delta. The analysis helped identify communities that were subjected to floods and needed more attention in disaster management. People in the MRD had remarkably low exposure, which was the result of investment in water structures. About 59.2 % of the surveyed households were moderately vulnerable to flooding. Families in O Mon, Thanh Binh, Cai Be, and Cho Lach district had the highest vulnerability indices. The most significant indicators to explain the flood-prone state were rice-related indicators, elderly dependency ratios, and social capital. The study suggested that plans to reduce flood vulnerability should . focus on the family's adaptability because it had the largest impacts.

(2014) to improve our understanding of decisions related to urban climate adaptation by situating policy interventions in a broader governance context. To develop this argument we use a qualitative case study from Cape Town, South Africa of a local government intervention in an informal settlement suffering from annual flooding. The intervention took the form of gravel platforms raising the ground on which residential dwellings were located. We argue that the meaning and purpose of this intervention have been shaped by multiple social agendas promoted by various actors, producing a contested result and arguably impacting on the potential of the intervention to serve as a pathway to increased adaptive capacity. In addition to the notion of adaptive pathways, we draw on the notions of governance configuration and local policy subversion to explain the case in question.

As a practical way to address these issues, exploitation of urban rainwater resources has become a worldwide hotspot for research and application. This paper 1) briefly examined the evolution of rainwater utilization management modes in advanced countries, 2) classified urban rainwater utilization measures from the utilization stages into three categories-source control, medium transmission, and terminal treatment, 3) summarized the advantages, disadvantages, and scope of the application of these measures, 4) reviewed the benefits, drawbacks, and application areas of these measures, and 5) conducted a quantitative analysis of their impact on rainwater pollution and flood control.

Depth-damage curves for rail rapid transit infrastructure	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coastal flooding; depth-damage; fragility; infrastructure; rail; risk assessment; transit	FLOOD; UNCERTAINTY; RISK	Estimates of flood-related damages and costs often rely on asset-specific depth-damage curves that characterize the fragility of a given asset. To date, there are very few depth-damage curves that are potentially applicable to rail rapid transit infrastructure, and no studies attempt to construct these relationships specifically these asset classes. Given the lack of empirical performance data or asset-specific reliability tests, we solicited expert engineering judgment to characterize the fragility of transit assets to saltwater flood exposure. We validate the resulting synthetic depth-damage relationships via a benchmarking approach and demonstrate consistency with previously published depth-damage curves for similar asset classes. The solicitation framework presented can easily be extended to other infrastructure assets and systems, potentially serving as a key step toward a more rigorous quantification of the potential risks posed to infrastructure by natural hazards and climate change.

We propose an empirical application of alternative valuation approaches developed in recent literature, including equity weights and risk premium multipliers, to a case study in Ecuador. The results show that accounting for inequality may substantially alter the conclusions of a standard vulnerability approach, with important consequences for policy choices pertaining damage compensation and prioritization of intervention areas.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; STORMS; TEMPERATURE; INCREASE; EXTENT	The effect of climate change on precipitation intensity is well documented. However, findings regarding changes in spatial extent of extreme precipitation events are still ambiguous as previous studies focused on particular regions and time domains. This study addresses this ambiguity by investigating the pattern of changes in the spatial extent of short duration extreme precipitation events globally. A grid-based indicator termed Spatial-Homogeneity is proposed and used to assess the changes of spatial extent in Global Precipitation Measurement records. This study shows that (a) rising temperature causes significant shrinking of precipitation extent in tropics, but an expansion of precipitation extent in arid regions, (b) storms with higher precipitation intensity show a faster decrease in spatial extent, and (c) larger spatial extent storms are associated with higher total precipitable water. Results imply that in a warming climate, tropics may experience severe floods as storms may become more intense and spatially concentrated.

It uses CMIP 6 projections with four SSP scenarios, i.e., SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585. The yearly value of the heatwave magnitude index is used to classify the events in cities. The forthcoming forecast is distributed into three identical periods of 27 years each, i.e., near- (2020-2046), mid- (2047-2073), and long-term periods (2074-2100). The outcomes from the study showed that heatwave events would increase across the cities for all periods under SSP 370 and 585 scenarios. It is computed that 104 extreme events are probable to be observed across these four cities. This study highlights the importance of adaptive techniques in dealing with the negative implications of predicted heatwave weather events.

A coupled rainfall-flood-traffic model has been developed as the prerequisite for evaluation with publicly available data. The DPSIR method integrates the natural and transportation systems into causeeffect-response impact chains and facilitates dynamic traffic performance measurement on the road and network levels. We apply this approach to the urban networks' motorways, trunk, and arterial roads in Shanghai, China. The results help identify critical roads and verify the effectiveness of demand-control strategies in improving traffic resilience. By offering decision-makers a comprehensive view of traffic operation under disruptions, this method can help them build a more resilient transport system in flood risk management.

A risk analysis of natural disasters is helpful not only for disaster prevention and reduction, but also in reducing economic and social losses. Currently, there are many methods for natural disaster risk analysis. Based on the uncertainty, unfavorable and future characteristics of natural disaster risk, this paper summarizes the methods for disaster risk analysis based on the scope of application, research results, and focus; it also clarifies the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, as well as the scope of application, to provide a reference for selecting and optimizing methods for future disaster risk analysis.

Using the fixed-effects model with instrumental variables to address the endogeneity of disaster aid, we find that increased PA grants reduce a county's flood insurance take-up rates, thereby driving down its total insurance coverage and premiums paid. Our findings provide empirical evidence on the crowding-out effect of public disaster programs, and shed light on their implicit social costs and increased federal financial exposure to natural disasters and climate change.

Therefore, it is of great scientific significance to discuss the causes and characteristic quantization of extreme floods and droughts. Here, the terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On (GRACE-FO) data was used to characterize the floods and droughts in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) during 2003 and 2020. To reduce the uncertainty of TWSC results, the generalized three-cornered hat and least square methods were used to fuse TWSC results from six GRACE solutions. Then combining precipitation (PPT), evapotranspiration, soil moisture (SM), runoff, and extreme climate index data, the influence of climate change on floods and droughts in the YRB was discussed and analyzed. The results show that the fused method can effectively improve the uncertainty of TWSC results. And seven droughts and seven floods occurred in the upper of YRB (UY) and nine droughts and six floods appeared in the middle and lower of YRB (MLY) during the study period. The correlation between TWSC and PPT (0.33) is the strongest in the UY, and the response time between the two is 1 month, while TWSC and SM (0.67) are strongly correlated with no delay in the MLY. The reason for this difference is mainly due to the large-scale hydropower development in the UY. Floods and droughts in the UY and MLY are more influenced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (correlation coefficients are 0.39 and 0.50, respectively) than the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) (correlation coefficients are 0.19 and 0.09, respectively). The IOD event is usually accompanied by the ENSO event (the probability is 80%), and the hydrological hazards caused by independent ENSO events are less severe than those caused by these two extreme climate events in the YRB. Our results provide a reference for the study on the formation, development, and recovery mechanism of regional floods and droughts on a global scale.

From flood paths to floodways, an efficient method to map, identify and evaluate suitable floodways: A case study from Trondheim, Norway	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Geographical information system (GIS); Floodways; Stormwater management; Sustainable drainage systems; Urban flooding; Urban flood resilience	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; URBAN DRAINAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESOLUTION; RISK	Due to climate change and rapid urbanisation, many Norwegian cities and urban areas suffer from pluvial flooding caused by intense rainfall exceeding the capacity of the stormwater management system. This results in increased runoff rates, volumes and peak flows in the drainage network. In response to these challenges, the authors explore the potential of utilising the urban surface's ability to transport floodwater as an integral component of the stormwater infrastructure. When the capacity of the stormwater drainage system is exceeded, the overland flow paths transporting floodwater are considered a part of the stormwater management system, as floodways. The study proposes a spatial GIS method to map existing drainage lines and identify existing surface areas that function as floodways, combined with an automated process to identify which drainage lines could be implemented as stormwater management measures. Critical points are introduced to assess the floodways' potential hazards, combined with a classification method to evaluate and sort floodways. A case study from Trondheim, Norway, was used to demonstrate how drainage lines can be identified as floodways using the proposed method. The case study is also used to illustrate how a GIS-based analysis can be extended from identifying to evaluating floodways and whether GIS is sufficient for floodway evaluation. The method enables urban planners and municipalities to identify which areas of the urban surface already function as floodways during extreme events, and to prioritise measures to secure such areas and increase the city's flood resilience. The results highlight the need to assess existing areas that function as floodways, and to implement and design needed areas as floodways. GIS-based methods combined with an evaluation scheme can be an adequate tool to map and evaluate floodways in urban areas. When using GIS-based methods, however, the corresponding hazard potential, and also the uncertainty of the floodway's spatial placement, should be considered.	[Skrede, T.

The Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument, Level-2A) has a specific band for snow probability mapping that indicates glaciers and snow cover; this is effective for recognizing proglacial lakes by calculating the NDWIice. It is also helpful for lithology with SWIR for granite moraine deposits and slate moraines in the proglacial environment Palcacocha; these deposits surround the proglacial lake, with NDWIice determining the perimeter where sediment interacts with the rocks and meltwater. In addition, there are high radon concentrations made by ice avalanche impacts on the proglacial lake. Unstable glacier blocks cause ice avalanches into this proglacial lake, and the radon responds to flow variations from these high-impact avalanches. We used the device RadonEye PLus2, which allows real-time detection of radon flux changes in the proglacial environment. Our results indicated that ice avalanches making a high impact in the proglacial lake cause turbulent flow and generate radon concentration marks with a rising magnitude, while the absence of ice avalanches in the lake will cause the values to go down. The relationships of radon concentrations in the atmosphere for a tropical proglacial environment are radon and temperature (R-2 = 0.364), radon and humidity (R-2 = 0.469). In a passive proglacial environment with prolonged rainfall, radon concentrations tend to decrease, with an inversely proportional relationship between humidity and radon in the tropical proglacial environment. Proglacial lakes in the tropical zone often have large volumes of freshwater with high slopes from tropical glaciers, and climate change effects are an imminent danger for nearby cities.

The physical factors inducing landslides are relatively well-known. However, how landslide susceptibility will be exacerbated by climate change, impede the attainment of the sustainable development goals and increase health vulnerability is relatively less explored. We present an integrated assessment of landslide susceptibility, health vulnerability and overall risk to understand these interconnected dimensions using Arunachal Pradesh, India, as a case study, which is susceptible to landslides due to its topography and climate conditions. Landslide susceptibility was examined using twenty landslide conditioning parameters through the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). The susceptibility map was validated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4) data were used to analyze the health vulnerability, while the overall risk was computed through the integration of susceptibility and vulnerability. Landslide susceptibility analysis indicated that nearly 22% area of the state is characterized by moderate susceptibility followed by high (17%) and very high susceptibility (13%). High elevation, slope, rainfall, SPI, drainage density and complex geology were identified as the causative factors of landslides. In the case of health vulnerability, East Kameng and Lohit districts were found to be very highly vulnerable, while Papum Pare, Changlang and Tirap districts experience high health vulnerability due to high degree of exposure and sensitivity. Overall risk analysis revealed over 16.8% area of the state is under moderate risk followed by high (9.8%) and very high (4.2%) risk. Linking this analysis with the climate change projections and SDG goals attainment revealed that Papum Pare, Upper Subansiri, Tirap and West Kameng require priority for lessening susceptibility, vulnerability and risk for achieving sustainable development. A strong correlation (99%) between HVI and risk further demonstrates the need for lessening health vulnerability and risk in the study area. Furthermore, our study contributes additional insights into landslide susceptibility by considering heal vulnerability and risk which may help in planning sustainable development strategies in a changing climate.

The scarcity of observations is one of the major challenges for understanding various land surface processes in the mountainous and mostly ungauged terrain. The study assesses the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes between 1980 and 2020 and extreme rainfall on peak discharge and sediment yield in the Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB), Kashmir Himalaya, India using KINEROS2 model. Analysis of LULC change revealed a notable shift from natural LULC to more intensive human-modified LULC, including a decrease in vegetative cover, deforestation, urbanization, and improper farming practices. The findings revealed a strong influence of the LULC changes on peak discharge, and sediment yield relative to the 2014 timeframe, which coincided with the catastrophic September 2014 flood event. The model predicted a peak discharge of 115,101 cubic feet per second (cfs) and a sediment yield of 56.59 tons/ha during the September 2014 flooding, which is very close to the observed peak discharge of 115,218 cfs indicating that the model is reliable for discharge prediction. The model predicted a peak discharge of 98,965 cfs and a sediment yield of 49.11 tons/ha in 1980, which increased to 118,366 cfs and, 58.92 tons/ha, respectively, in 2020, showing an increase in basin's flood risk over time. In the future, it is anticipated that the ongoing LULC changes will make flood vulnerability worse, which could lead to another major flooding in the event of an extreme rainfall as predicted under climate change and, in turn, compromise achievement of sustainable development goals (SDG). Therefore, regulating LULC in order to modulate various hydrological and land surface processes would ensure stability of runoff and reduction in sediment yield in the UJB, which is critical for achieving many SDGs.

Objective classification of weather types for the Eastern Siberia over the 1970-2020 period using the Jenkinson and Collison method	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Atmospheric circulation; Weather type classification; Jenkinson and Collison method; Eastern Siberia; Precipitation	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; GLACIERS; TRENDS; PATTERNS; REGIME; RANGE; FLOOD	A daily catalogue of weather types based on the Jenkinson and Collison (JC) objective approach has been developed for the Eastern Siberia region of Russia (47.5-67.5 N, 102.5-132.5 E) during the period 1970-2020. The mean sea level pressure (MSLP) dataset from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis was used for the classification. A statistical analysis of the annual, seasonal and monthly distribution of 27 weather types has been accomplished. For the entire period, the most frequent weather types were found to be anticyclonic (A, 23.5%), followed by cyclonic (C, 11.5%), unclassified (U, 9.1%) and the pure advective types N (6.9%), NE (6.0%) and W (5.4%). The advective atmospheric patterns are predominated by northerly and westerly components, which tend to weaken in summer and strengthen in the winter and transitional seasons. The westerlies dominate in the cold half of the year (October-March), while the easterlies are prevailing in the warm season (April-September). The long-term trends in frequencies of the atmospheric circulation patterns over the study period have been analysed. There are statistically significant decreasing trends of anticyclonic weather types, while types with northerly and westerly components show increasing trends. The relationships between the atmospheric circulation patterns and surface precipitation were ascertained from 87 meteorological stations. Anticyclonic weather types are consistent with dry weather conditions in all seasons, while cyclonic and advective types with easterly component are correlated with wet weather conditions. The seasonal reversal of zonal airflow across the study area (the westerly flow in winter and the easterly in summer), accompanied by the wetter weather conditions for the easterly circulation patterns, suggests the influence of the East Asian monsoon. Regional climate changes of recent decades, such as accelerated glacier shrinkage in the 1990s, increasing the number of droughts, and rainfall variability are in good agreement with the revealed atmospheric circulation patterns.

We investigated the spatiotemporal variations in light precipitation events with intensities of 0.1-10 mm/day, based on daily precipitation data for the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China, during 1960-2018, and explored their relationships with large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (LSACPs) and altitude. For further analysis of the changes in the light precipitation events, we classified light rain (0.1 <= P < 10.0 mm/day) into five grades of intensity by using equal interval division. Results indicate that the mean annual light precipitation amount and days were 182.7 mm and 80 days, respectively, from 1960 to 2018 over the YRB, accounting for 39.2% and 85.2% of the total annual precipitation amount and days, respectively. Both the amount of light rain and the number of light precipitation days declined by -1.3 mm/decade and -1.4 days/decade, respectively, and suggested that most rain events were of low intensity (0.1 <= P < 2.0 mm/day). Light precipitation events mainly occurred in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB and decreased from the southwest to the north. Additionally, changes in light rain events appear to be complex and possibly related to LSACPs and altitude. We found that the LSACPs were a possible mechanism for light precipitation events in the YRB over the past decades. With increasing elevation, light precipitation events decreased significantly throughout the study period. Thus, the decrease in precipitation days mainly occurred at lower altitudes in the YRB. The results also reflect the complexity of regional climate change in the YRB because atmospheric circulation related to climate phenomena not only causes the complex variation in precipitation but also changes its altitude dependence.

As the climate continues to warm, reliable future precipitation projections are needed to provide the best possible information to decision makers. However, future changes in the magnitude of extreme precipitation are uncertain, as current state-ofthe-art global climate models are typically run at relatively coarse horizontal resolutions that require the use of convective parameterization and have difficulty simulating observed extreme rainfall rates. Here, we performed ensembles of convection-permitting regional climate model simulations to investigate how five historically impactful extreme precipitation events over the San Francisco Bay Area could change if similar events occurred in future climates. We found that changes in storm-total precipitation depend strongly on storm type. Precipitation associated with an atmospheric river (AR) accompanied by an extratropical cyclone (ETC) is projected to increase at a rate exceeding (by up to 1.5 times) the theoretical Clausius Clapeyron scaling of 6-7% per ? warming. On the other hand, future precipitation changes are weak or negative for events characterized by an AR only, despite increases in precipitable water and integrated vapor transport that are similar to those of the co-occurring AR and ETC events. The differences in the sign of future precipitation change between AR-only events and co-occurring AR and ETC events is instead linked with changes in mid-tropospheric vertical velocity. Given that the majority of observed ARs are associated with an ETC, this research has important implications for future precipitation impacts over the Bay Area, as it indicates that storm-total precipitation associated with the most common type of storm event may increase by up to 26-37% in 2100 relative to historical.

This study employs comprehensive data obtained in 2018 from 4351 farm households in five countries to appraise the key climate hazards experienced by farmers, the risk coping methods adopted, and factor influencing the use of these methods. Although droughts, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests/diseases are major climate-induced risks in ESA. droughts are predominant in all these countries. Farm households in ESA have adopted various strategies to address climate risk, which includes changing farming practices, reducing consumption, using savings and borrowing, and seeking new employment. Farming families headed by a female, married, or an elderly member opt to change farming methods and decrease consumption, whereas they are less inclined to look for alternate livelihood options. Farming families with higher livestock endowments commonly use savings or borrow and are unlikely to change farming methods, decrease consumption, and search for alternate employment. Better-off families tend to change farming methods but are unlikely to adopt other risk coping options. Farming families with non-farm livelihood options are unlikely to change farming methods, use savings/borrowings, or decrease consumption, whereas they tend to search for alternate employment.Training on agriculture and economic status are crucial for climate change adaptation in these regions. Findings exhibit substantial differences among the study countries regarding the adoption of coping strategies. Compared to farmers in Kenya, farmers in other countries change agricultural methods to cope with climate shocks. Ethiopian farmers, compared to their Kenyan counterparts, decrease consumption to deal with climate risks, whereas, farmers in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique are less likely to use this option. Similarly, the likelihood of seeking alternative employment as a risk coping strategy is lower among Ethiopian farmers, while it is higher among the farmers in other countries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Flooding that is mainly attributed to extreme storms usually accounts for an ambitious target in weather-related hazard mitigation over China. Previous works seldom focused on flooding evolution patterns under climate change at a national scale, and fewer flooding projections considered the estimation uncertainty sourced from limited samples. This study systematically projected changes in flood quantiles based on annual maximum series and seasonality and also evaluated the variations of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over mainland China under the emission scenario of representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. In order to project future streamflow series, the bias-corrected outputs of six global climate models (GCMs) were input into a best-performing hydrological model, which was selected from four calibrated hydrological models based on the KGE criteria. The Pearson type-III (P-III) distribution and L-moments (L-M) method were employed to derive the flood quantiles for different return periods during historical (1961-2005) and future (2056-2100) periods, and the bootstrapping method was applied to estimate the sampling uncertainty. A regression trend method was used to track the variations of flood seasonality in the context of climate warming. Our results project earlier flood timing and larger flood quantiles for most catchments in future period than those in the historical period, despite being accompanied by substantial spatial variations. We also project that the sampling uncertainty in estimating flood quantiles is increased in a warming future. Many catchments are exposed to dramatic changes in both flood quantile and estimation uncertainty by over 50%, while only a few catchments are projected to have decreasing flood risks. These results suggest an urgent need to improve the functionality of early warning systems and increase societal resilience to warming climates over China.

The area of Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City is about 2095 km(2), 60% of which lying under 2 m above MSL. Its population is about 8.136 million. Economic development has led to flood-related problems. The causes of floods are monsoon rainfalls, high tides, and outflows from the Dau Tieng Reservoir, upstream of HCM City. This paper proposed a plausible solution for flood mitigation in HCM City by uplifting the Dau Tieng dam crest. This solution can be recommended based on the results of an extensive simulation study which used: (i) a statistical downscaling procedure for evaluating the climate change (CC) impacts on precipitations; (ii) the MARINE model for simulating the rainfall-runoff process; (iii) the Telemac2D model for simulating the inundation; and (iv) the GIS tool for representing the inundated areas under different CC scenarios. It was found that under the A2 scenario an increase of rainfall by 2050s and added 40% of this rainfall (assuming due to tropical depression), the maximum regulated discharges released from the Dau Tieng dam could reach 1650, 500 and 300 m(3)s(-1) without any enhancement then with the dam enhancement of 1.0 and 1.5 m, respectively. As comparing to event occurred on July 21, 2009 due to the combined effect of a heavy rainfall and a high tide condition, the inner city flooding area increases by 1.2, 1.3 and 8.2% with the dam enhancement of 1.5, 1.0 m and without dam enhancement, respectively. Results of this study have therefore provided critical information for making a logical decision concerning the possibility of uplifting the height of the crest of the Dau Tieng dam to mitigate the urban flooding in HCM City under the threat of CC and sea level rise.

A wide array of green infrastructure including urban trees is getting attention to mitigate those problems; however, magnitude, patterns and processes of hydrological functional capacity of different tree species at micro-scales are largely unknown. We measured morphology, above and below ground growth of two ecologically contrasting street tree species at two streets in Munich, Germany: Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Tilia cordata Mill. during 2016-17. Additionally, tree transpiration, meteorological and edaphic variables including soil hydraulic conductivity was measured on two streets. Overall the soil physical properties including bulk density, particle size distribution and meteorological variables were not significantly different at the two sites. A higher soil infiltration rate (0.42 cm/min) under the canopies of R. pseudoacacia compared to the T. cordata (0.29 cm/min) was mainly attributed to the higher annual growth rate of R. pseudoacacia and showed a significant correlation (r = 0.62) with infiltration rate. Subsequently, R. pseudoacacia showed increased fine root biomass compared to T. cordata (121 g/m(2 )and 27 g/m(2) respectively). However, T. cordata trees transpired three times more compared to R. pseudoacacia which indicated that they might have a deeper roofing system. The study showed that fast growing species such as R. pseudoacacia can enhance infiltration through its intense fine roofing system creating channels in the upper soil. Moreover, grass cover also plays a role both in infiltration and ground evapotranspiration compared to the built surfaces and can enhance the processes if planted in combination with less water using species. Secondly, higher root biomass and infiltration further away from the tree trunk suggest a need for larger tree planting pits whereas species such as T. cordata are better suited in paved cutout pits inducing vertical roofing depth.

G.; Durcan, Julie A.; Burrough, Sallie L.; Parton, Ash			The aggradation of alluvial fans in response to monsoon variability over the last 400 ka in the Hajar Mountains, south-east Arabia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Climate change; Indian ocean monsoon; Luminescence dating; palaeoenvironments; Geomorphology; Arabia	RUB AL-KHALI; DOSE-RATE; INDIAN MONSOON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHERN OMAN; SINGLE; DEPOSITS; QUARTZ; RECORD; GRAINS	The preservation and interpretation of past external forcings within sedimentary archives can be complicated. Marine proxy records show that, throughout the Mid-Late Quaternary, monsoon rainfall in south-east Arabia has varied at precessional timescales (similar to 23 ka). By contrast, terrestrial environmental records from the region, such as speleothems and palaeolake sequences, generally only capture rainfall variability at eccentricity (similar to 100 ka) timescales and geomorphological archives rarely record events over multiple glacial cycles. Previous work has suggested that the alluvial fan systems of the Hajar Mountains record aggradation coincident with precessional peaks because of more northerly Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon (IOSM) rainfall, relative to present. However, the alluvial record is complex: there is a growing body of 'anomalous' aggradation age data from periods of precessional minima and it is spatially uneven, mainly being derived from fans at either the northern-or southern-most extents of the western side of the mountains. We present optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of alluvial aggradation from new sites in the central portion of the western and eastern sides of the Hajar mountains. Sedimentary units that show evidence of more sustained flow conditions, such as coarse conglomerate deposition and the development of thick floodplain deposits, typically date to periods of higher IOSM rainfall at precessional timescales. Sites where there is evi-dence of deposition under more ephemeral flow conditions, like today, yield ages corresponding to precessional minima. We synthesise these data with similarly interpreted alluvial and lacustrine deposits from across the region, employing a hierarchical clustering approach to generate clusters of ages representing periods of increased hydrological activity. This objective approach to regional chronological data suggests that ten periods of more sustained hydrological activity are evidenced across the Hajar region, broadly aligning to precessional and eccentricity peaks over the last 400 ka. These clusters show that Hajar fans predominately aggrade because of increasing rainfall over their catchments, with the central ages of clusters often aligning with the onset of precessional forcing. Hajar alluvial systems preserve important records of Quaternary climate variability over long timescales in an arid region where terrestrial records are scarce due to preservation issues.

Frequent floods in the area, results from anthropogenic activities, climate change, unpredictable weather, and heavy rainfall cause loss of life, property, and resources. Flood hazard susceptibility maps will help in identifying risk-prone locations, which aids in flood management and the decision-making process. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of bivariate statistical and hybrid models such as Frequency ratio, Weight of Evidence (WoE), Evidential Belief Function (EBF), Index of Entropy, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), AHP-TOPSIS and AHP VIKOR to prepare flood susceptibility maps of the Brahmani River basin, India. The flood conditioning factor includes Slope, Aspect, Elevation, Curvature, Geology, Geomorphology, Topographic Wetness Index, Topographic Ruggedness Index, Distance from Streams, Distance from Roads, Rainfall, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Stream Power Index, Soil, Drainage Density, and Land use Land cover. The flood inventory was prepared using various atlas and news reports. Multicollinearity among all the causative parameters is measured using the Variance Inflation factor (VIF) and Tolerance (TOL). The collection of a spatial database and flood inventory from various sources is used to prepare flood susceptibility maps. The flood susceptibility map is categorised into very high, high, moderate, low, and very low classes using the natural break method. The models are validated using flood training (70%) and testing (30%) points. The accuracy of flood susceptibility maps is determined using Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curves and Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) values. The success rate of Frequency ratio (AUC 0.91), EBF (AUC 0.90) and WoE (AUC 0.86) show the highest accuracy among all other models in AUC. WoE, IoE, and FR gave reliable results in the SCAI validation process. The susceptibility maps will help in identifying hazard-prone areas, which will help policy makers better assessment of natural hazards.

In this study, a hybrid approach based on a combination of the optimization of a hydrodynamic model and an error correction modeling that exploit different aspects of the physical system is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy of flood water levels. In the parameter optimization procedure for the hydrodynamic model, Manning's roughness coefficients were estimated by considering their spatial distribution and temporal variation in unsteady flow conditions. In the following error correction procedure, the systematic errors of the optimized hydrodynamic model were captured by combining the input variable selection method using partial mutual information (PMI) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), and therefore, complementary information provided by the data was achieved. The developed ANNs were used to analyze the potential non-linear relationships between the considered state variables and simulation errors to predict systematic errors. To assess the hybrid forecasting approach (hydrodynamic model with an ANN-based error correction model), performances of the hydrodynamic model, two ANN-based water-level forecasting models (ANN1 and ANN2), and the hybrid model were compared. Regarding input candidates, ANN1 considers the historical observations only, and ANN2 considers not only the historical observations that used in ANN1 but also the prescribed boundary conditions required for the hydrodynamic forecast model. As a result, the hybrid model significantly improved the forecasting accuracy of flood water levels compared to individual models, which indicates that the hybrid model is able to take advantage of complementary strengths of both the hydrodynamic model and the ANN model. The optimization of the hydrodynamic model allowing spatially and temporally variable parameters estimated water levels with acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, the use of PMI-based input variable selection and optimized ANNs as error correction models for different sites were proven to successfully predict simulation errors in the hydrodynamic model. Hence, the parameter optimization of the hydrodynamic model coupled with error correction modeling for water level forecasting can be used to provide accurate information for flood management.

Due to their episodic nature, the variability of local sea level response, and our short observational record, understanding the natural variability of storm surges is at least as important as understanding projected long-term mean sea level changes due to global warming. Using the December 2013 North Atlantic Storm Xaver as a baseline, we used a meteorological forecast modification tool to create "grey swan" events, whilst maintaining key physical properties of the storm system. Here we define "grey swan" to mean an event which is expected on the grounds of natural variability but is not within the observational record. For each of these synthesised storm events, we simulated storm tides and waves in the North Sea using hydrodynamic models that are routinely used in operational forecasting systems. The grey swan storms produced storm surges that were consistently higher than those experienced during the December 2013 event at all analysed tide gauge locations along the UK east coast. The additional storm surge elevations obtained in our simulations are comparable to high-end projected mean sea level rises for the year 2100 for the European coastline. Our results indicate strongly that mid-latitude storms, capable of generating more extreme storm surges and waves than ever observed, are likely due to natural variability. We confirmed previous observations that more extreme storm surges in semi-enclosed basins can be caused by slowing down the speed of movement of the storm, and we provide a novel explanation in terms of slower storm propagation allowing the dynamical response to approach equilibrium. We did not find any significant changes to maximum wave heights at the coast, with changes largely confined to deeper water. Many other regions of the world experience storm surges driven by mid-latitude weather systems. Our approach could therefore be adopted more widely to identify physically plausible, low probability, potentially catastrophic coastal flood events and to assist with major incident planning.

Soil erosion threatens the functioning of urban areas, which was the reason for choosing the territory of the Master Plan of Belgrade (Serbia) as the research area. The calculation of soil erosion loss was analyzed using the G2 erosion model. The model belongs to a group of empirical models and is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). The estimation of soil degradation was analyzed in two time periods (2001 and 2019), which represent the time boundaries of the management of the Master Plan of Belgrade. The novel approach used in this research is based on using the land cover inventory as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. Land cover was identified using remote sensing, machine learning techniques, and the random forest algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission in combination with spectral indices. Climatic parameters were analyzed on the basis of data from meteorological stations (first scenario, i.e., 2001), as well as on simulations of changes based on climate scenario RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathways) concerning the current condition of the land cover (second scenario). A comparative analysis of the two time periods identified a slight reduction in total soil loss. For the first period, the average soil loss value is 4.11 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). The analysis of the second period revealed an average value of 3.63 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). However, the increase in non-porous surfaces has led to a change in the focus of soil degradation. Increased average soil loss as one of the catalysts of torrential flood frequencies registered on natural and semi-natural areas were 43.29% and 16.14%, respectively. These results are a significant contribution to the study of soil erosion in urban conditions under the impact of climate change.

Human activities and changes in climate over the past six decades may have affected the discharge and sediment load to some extent. In the current study, the river discharge and sediment characteristics in the mainstream of the Yom River were investigated using the field observation data from 2011 to 2013 and the historical river flow and sediment data from 1954 to 2014 at six hydrological stations operated by the Royal Irrigation Department of Thailand (RID). The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and double mass curve were used to analyze the sediment dynamics and temporal changes in the discharge of the Yom River. The results revealed that the sediment was mainly transported in suspension, and the bed-tosuspended sediment loads ratio varied between 0 and 0.05. The daily suspended sediment load (SSL) in the upper and middle basins had a strong correlation with the daily discharge and could be represented by power equations with coefficients of determination higher than 0.8. The daily suspended sediment load in the lower basin did not directly depend on the corresponding discharge because of the reduction in river slope and water diversion by irrigation projects. It also appeared that the river discharges and sediment loads were mainly influenced by climate variation (floods and droughts). Moreover, the average sediment transport of the upper, middle, and lower reaches were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.35 million t/y, respectively. The sediment load in the lower basin decreased more than 50% as a result of changes in the river gradient (from mountainous to floodplain areas). The results from sediment analysis also indicated that the construction of the Mae Yom Barrage, the longest diversion dam in Thailand, and land-use changes did not significantly affect the sediment load along the Yom River.

While this is to be expected, very few studies have quantified this influence. This study has analysed the effects of evaporation and sedimentation on reservoirs operational performance. It used seven reservoirs in Yesilirmak Basin, Turkey as case studies. The Dams serve a variety of purposes including irrigation, domestic and industrial, hydropower generation and flood control. Performance with regard to meeting these needs was characterized using reliability (time-based and volume-based), resilience, vulnerability and sustainability. The results showed that while ignoring both the evaporation and sedimentation during planning does affect subsequent operational performance, the influence of evaporation was more significant. Possible reasons are provided for the outcome and ways by which both can be accommodated during planning analyses thus mitigating the operational effects are suggested.

From the perspective of integrated flood management, the government and public need to reach a consensus on disasters and disaster response, and set a reasonable regional protection standard for the city to jointly respond to disasters. This study establishes an operable framework for setting protection standard. The framework uses cost-benefit analysis and data envelopment analysis to maximize the efficiency of water management, so as to compare the differences between different administrative districts under the same return period and between different return period under the same administrative districts, and then determines the best protection standard. The results find that adopting a unified protection standard will not maximize the benefits of resources, but it can be used as a basis for setting flood control standards for different public facilities and building types.

The number of NBS is increasing, but research gaps still exist at the governance level. The objectives of this paper are (i) to give an overview of the implemented NBS for flood risk management and mitigation in Germany, (ii) to identify governance models that are applied, and (iii) to explore the differences between these models. The results of a hierarchical clustering procedure and a qualitative analysis show that while no one-size-fits-all governance model exists, polycentricism is an important commonality between the projects. The study concludes by highlighting the need for further research on traditional governance model reconversion and paradigm changes. We expect the findings to identify what has worked in the past, as well as what is important for the implementation of NBS for flood risk management in future projects.

However, their relationship is still in dispute. So far, three approaches have been suggested: interchangeable, distinct and interrelated. We argue that the third is the most useful as it provides insights into how long-term adaptation can be achieved by a series of short-term coping mechanisms. Within this focus, we interpret adaptation in a novel way: as a complex cumulative result based on the interaction between multiple coping mechanisms and vulnerability dynamics. As such we reorient Smit et al.'s work on "cumulative adaptation". Our empirical case is slum households affected by floods from the Mekong River in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The inquiry is based on 119 surveys and 25 semi-structured interviews in nine slum communities. The results capture new trajectories of adaptation (or maladaptation), livelihoods and local collective action. The article explores implications for local development in slum communities in the global South.

Seagrass meadows, like other coastal ecosystems, attenuate waves. Due to inconsistencies in how wave at-tenuation is measured results cannot be directly compared. We synthesised data from laboratory and field experiments of seagrass-wave attenuation by converting measurements to drag coefficients (C-D). Drag coefficients varied from 0.02-5.12 with (C) over bar (D) = 0.74 for studies conducted in turbulent flow in non-storm conditions. A statistical model suggested that seagrass species affects C-D although the exact mechanism remains unclear. A wave model using the estimated (C) over bar (D) as an input parameter demonstrated that wave attenuation increased with meadow length, shoot density, shoot width and canopy height. Findings can be used to estimate wave at-tenuation by seagrass, in any given set of conditions.

Many local governments have identified strategies to prepare for the impacts of sea level rise but often lack funding mechanisms. To date, the assumption that coastal adaptation is a public good has limited the tools used to finance responses to sea level rise. We argue that good characteristics - subtractability, excludability, heterogeneity, joint production, and capital intensity - combine in unique ways across adaptation strategies, and few strategies provide exclusively public goods. These good characteristics create political opportunities for application of financing mechanisms such as property taxes, district-level finance, and bonds that have been less commonly used for adaptation. Exploring the good characteristics of a particular adaptation strategy can help communities identify an appropriate and feasible mechanism for financing it.

These changes lead to the growing possibility of flood damages. In South Korea, a government established the "Comprehensive Flood Prevention Plan (CFPP)" for each of river basin against flood. The plan is based on the combination of structural measures selected by experienced hydrologists. However, it lacks clear criteria. To solving this problem, this study classifies the structural measures and suggests a combination method, which use relationships between measures, to ensure the objectivity of the process in identifying proper measures. For Anyangcheon river basin, two plans are provided; the first is developed by the study, and the other is by the CFPP. Comparing the two plans, the results show that the combination, selected by proposed method in this study, is economically more feasible compared to CFPP. Therefore, this study expected be useful when selecting and combining structural measures for formulating river basin flood prevention plans.

The comparison leads to the following conclusions. First, very high insurance penetration rates are usually associated with the direct involvement of the Government in the scheme, while they are not strictly correlated to its voluntary or compulsory nature, also because many intermediate solutions have been developed by EU countries. Second, since the link between insurance and risk reduction is not automatic, creative supporting measures are being tested by insurance schemes across the EU. Their success is, anyway, often disputed and needs to be further investigated. Third, the way ex post Government compensation is shaped does not directly impact on insurance penetration rates, but a certain degree of coordination between ex post Government compensation and insurance programs has the advantage of improving the efficient allocation of financial resources in risk management.

River floods with high peak discharge or long duration can increase the likelihood of infrastructure failure and enhance ecosystem vulnerability. However, changes in the peak and duration of floods and corresponding socioeconomic exposure under climate change are still poorly understood. This study employs a bivariate framework to quantify changes in flood risks and their socioeconomic impacts in China between the past (1985-2014) and future (2071-2100) in 204 catchments. Future daily river streamflow is projected by using a cascade modeling chain based on the outputs of five bias-corrected global climate models (GCMs) under three shared socioeconomic CMIP6 pathways (SSP1-26, SSP3-70, and SSP5-85), a machine learning model and four hydrological models. We also utilize the copula function to build the joint distribution of flood peak and duration, and calculate the joint return periods of the bivariate flood hazard. Finally, the exposure of population and regional gross domestic product to floods are investigated at the national scale. Our results indicate that flood peak and duration are likely to increase in the majority of catchments by 25%-100% by the late 21st century depending on the shared socioeconomic pathway. China is projected to experience a significant increase in bivariate flood risks even under the lowest emission pathway, with 24.0 million dollars/km(2) and 608 people/km(2) exposed under a moderate emissions scenario (SSP3-70). These findings have direct implications for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation policies in China. Plain Language Summary Our planet is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the dangers of river flooding, frequently causing significant environmental damage and economic losses. In a warming climate, precipitation extremes are projected to intensify, increasing flood risk as well as its environmental impacts. However, changes in the peak and duration of floods and corresponding socioeconomic exposure under climate change is little studied, particularly in China. By the late 21st century, the exposure of the population and China's total economic outputs/prospects is projected to reach 24.0 million dollars/km(2) and 608 people/km(2), even under considerable greenhouse gas emission. In order to mitigate the potential socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability, the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is necessary and urgent. Our findings provide valuable information for mitigating hazards and developing climate adaptation policies in China.

J	Wang, YZ; Liu, J; Xu, L; Yu, FL; Zhang, SJ				Wang, Yizhi; Liu, Jia; Xu, Lin; Yu, Fuliang; Zhang, Shanjun			Streamflow Simulation with High-Resolution WRF Input Variables Based on the CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model and Gamma Test	WATER			English	Article						WRF model; CNN-LSTM; Gamma test; streamflow simulation; hydrometeorological modeling	SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER; PARAMETERIZATION; SYSTEM; AREA	Streamflow modelling is one of the most important elements for the management of water resources and flood control in the context of future climate change. With the advancement of numerical weather prediction and modern detection technologies, more and more high-resolution hydro-meteorological data can be obtained, while traditional physical hydrological models cannot make full use of them. In this study, a hybrid deep learning approach is proposed for the simulation of daily streamflow in two mountainous catchments of the Daqing River Basin, northern China. Two-dimensional high-resolution (1 km) output data from a WRF model were used as the model input, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was used to extract the physical and meteorological characteristics of the catchment at a certain time, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model was applied to simulate the streamflow using the time-series data extracted by the CNN model. To reduce model input noise and avoid overfitting, the Gamma test method was adopted and the correlations between the input variables were checked to select the optimal combination of input variables. The performance of the CNN-LSTM models was acceptable without using the Gamma test (i.e., with all WRF input variables included), with NSE and RMSE values of 0.9298 and 9.0047 m(3)/s, respectively, in the Fuping catchment, and 0.8330 and 1.1806 m(3)/s, respectively, in the Zijingguan catchment. However, it was found that the performance of the model could be significantly improved by the use of the Gamma test. Using the best combination of input variables selected by the Gamma test, the NSE of the Fuping catchment increased to 0.9618 and the RMSE decreased to 6.6366 m(3)/s, and the NSE of the Zijingguan catchment increased to 0.9515 and the RMSE decreased to 0.6366 m(3)/s. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the CNN-LSTM approach for flood streamflow simulation using WRF-downscaled high-resolution data. By using this approach to assess the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow with the abundant high-resolution meteorological data generated by different climate scenarios, water managers can develop more effective strategies for managing water resources and reducing the risks associated with droughts and floods.

This study aims to identify how local, regional, and national German newspapers pick up and frame the issue of chemical pollution and related environmental and health risks regarding the 2021 summer flood using content analysis.ResultsThe analysis shows that chemical pollution is rarely addressed compared to other flood-related topics. We identified 189 newspaper articles published in the months following the flood, which specifically mention chemical emissions. Of these articles, 50 report only marginally on chemical pollution, while 36 focus on the factual description of chemical emissions without addressing the consequences of pollution. The remaining 103 articles address impacts of certain pollutants such as oil, pesticides, heavy metals, or dioxins. Using content analysis, we identified four narratives that were common in their broad storylines and used to create a problem frame: (i) Highlighting severe contamination of the environment with chemical pollutants causing serious environmental damage (31 articles), (ii) describing possible contamination but with uncertainty about the extent and consequences (39 articles), (iii) tending to give the all-clear and emphasizing that there is no severe long-term contamination (25 articles), and (iv) indicating continuous contamination that does not allow the all-clear to be given (8 articles).ConclusionsThe results suggest that flood-related chemical pollution does not receive much media attention. Where it does, coverage focuses primarily on the description of the "tangible parts" of pollution, and thus contamination by oil, depicted by both smell and oil streaks, is frequently addressed Articles indicating severe contamination suggest threats to human and environmental health as likely consequences. However, most articles only report the results of chemical monitoring in the contaminated regions, which are evaluated by experts. This contrasts with other topics of controversy related to the flood, such as climate change as a potential cause. In light of our study, we propose that media and science communication need to pay more attention to chemical pollution-in general and as a result of flood events.

This paper intends to provide a bibliometric analysis of nearly 30 years of urban flood resilience by mapping the knowledge domain, identifying evolving themes & trends over time, and extracting publications addressing urban flood resilience from the Scopus database. Trends, evolution, and mapping purpose of subject and field information analysis are undertaken using VOSviewer and SciMAT tools. The VOSviewer programme highlights the emphasis areas, whereas SciMAT traces the field's intellectual evolution across time and the essential themes that drove the transition. The study period is divided into four segments: 1996-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2022 based on the significant international policy milestones. The findings of the analysis highlight that the urban flood resilience field initially concentrated on a few themes and subsequently expanded to encompass the multi-dimensional characteristics of urban area resilience. In recent years, spatial planning approaches, nature-based and sustainable solutions, community-based and citizen science approaches, application of artificial intelligence, urban-rural relationship in resilience aspect, health services, and critical infrastructure networks have been the field's primary themes and concerns for achieving and assessing urban flood resilience. Despite a lack of emphasis on resilience assessment methods and approaches favouring conceptual framework and factors, it is observed that these themes are emerging in the developing scenario to solve the resilience concepts. The research may serve as a springboard for people's and policymakers' concerns about climate change and its effects, infrastructure development to improve the health and social well-being of societies, and a desire to learn more about resolving urban flooding problems in order to enhance flood management concepts pertaining to urban flood resilience and its history. Hence, a comprehensive list of themes and thematic areas concerning urban flood resilience with varying weights according to contexts is recommended, leading to the development of the urban flood resilient assessment tool and modifying the existing tools to reflect better the holistic understanding of sustainable and resilient cities/areas.

J	Mesta, C; Cremen, G; Galasso, C				Mesta, Carlos; Cremen, Gemma; Galasso, Carmine			Quantifying the potential benefits of risk-mitigation strategies on future flood losses in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							ADAPTATION; DAMAGE; URBAN; VULNERABILITY; MAP	Flood risk is expected to increase in many regionsworldwide due to rapid urbanization and climate change if adequaterisk-mitigation (or climate-change-adaptation) measures are not implemented. However, the exact benefits of these measures remain unknown or inadequately quantified for potential future events in some flood-prone areas such as Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, which this paper addresses. This study examines the present (2021) and future (2031) flood risk in Kathmandu Valley, considering two flood occurrence cases (with 100-year and 1000-year mean return periods) and using four residential exposure inventories representing the current urban system (Scenario A) or near-future development trajectories (Scenarios B, C, D) that Kathmandu Valley could experience. The findings revealsubstantial mean absolute financial losses (EUR 473 million and775 million in repair and reconstruction costs) and mean loss ratios(2.8 % and 4.5 %) for the respective flood occurrence cases in current times if the building stock's quality is assumed to have remained the same as in 2011 (Scenario A). Under a "no change" pathway for 2031 (Scenario B), where the vulnerability of the expanding building stock remains the same as in 2011, mean absolute financial losses would increase by 14 %-16 % over those of Scenario A. However, a minimum (0.20 m) elevation of existingresidential buildings located in the floodplains and the implementation offlood-hazard-informed land-use planning for 2031 (Scenario C) could decrease the mean absolute financial losses of the flooding occurrences by9 %-13 % and the corresponding mean loss ratios by 23 %-27 %,relative to those of Scenario A. Moreover, an additional improvement of thebuilding stock's vulnerability that accounts for the multi-hazard-pronenature of the valley (by means of structural retrofitting and building codeenforcement) for 2031 (Scenario D) could further decrease the mean lossratios by 24 %-28 % relative to those of Scenario A. The largest mean loss ratios computed in the four scenarios are consistently associated with populations of the highest incomes, which are largely located in thefloodplains. In contrast, the most significant benefits of risk mitigation(i.e., largest reduction in mean absolute financial losses or mean lossratios between scenarios) are experienced by populations of the lowestincomes. This paper's main findings can inform decision makers about thebenefits of investing in forward-looking multi-hazard risk-mitigationefforts.

In this study, an extreme rainfall event in summer 2020 which caused an urban flood in the city of Zagreb was analyzed from the hydro-meteorological point of view. To put this event in a broader climate context, first, a general climatology of the short-duration (from 5 to 120 min) rainfall amounts and trends in the associated extremes was analyzed for the Zagreb-Gric station in the period 1908-2020. For the flood event analysis, time series from additional two stations, a suburb and mountain one, were used covering the period 1959-2020. The generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), both stationary and non-stationary, was employed to estimate the return value curves. The results revealed more frequent short-duration wet events (rainfall amounts larger than the corresponding 10-year return values) occurring after the 1970s. Trend results showed a general increase in the amounts of precipitation with a range of duration from 30 to 120 min with the rate up to 2.9%/10 years. Combined with the analysis of occurrence of extremes during year and correlogram analysis, such results imply changes in the occurrence of corresponding weather types responsible for heavy rainfall episodes. The case study analysis showed that the 120-min extreme precipitation event in the summer 2020 over the city center was an exceptional one with the return period higher than 100 years. According to all available data, measurements and numerical weather prediction models, all ingredients for deep moist convection were present before the event, together with a deep layer shear. In addition, formation of cutoff low, the presence of an intense positive potential vorticity anomaly and the surface convergence line appear to be the main processes which further enhanced triggered deep convection, consequently also heavy precipitation. The hydrological analysis revealed that the sewerage system of Zagreb city could not drain the stormwater from the streets, pointing out the need for its redesign and adaptation to climate change.

Discharge and Temperature Controls of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) in a Forested Coastal Plain Stream	WATER			English	Article						DOM; fluorescence; Coastal Plain stream; carbon export; flow path; climate change; biodegradation; EEM-PARAFAC; redundancy analysis	FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; LAND-USE; WATERSHED EXPORTS; FRESH; DYNAMICS; CARBON; FLOODPLAIN; ABSORBENCY; CHEMISTRY; NUTRIENTS	Streams in the southeastern United States Coastal Plains serve as an essential source of energy and nutrients for important estuarine ecosystems, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from these streams can have profound impacts on the biogeochemical and ecological functions of fluvial networks. Here, we examined hydrological and temperature controls of DOM during low-flow periods from a forested stream located within the Coastal Plain physiographic region of Alabama, USA. We analyzed DOM via combining dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), and microbial degradation experiments. Four fluorescence components were identified: terrestrial humic-like DOM, microbial humic-like DOM, tyrosine-like DOM, and tryptophan-like DOM. Humic-like DOM accounted for -70% of total fluorescence, and biodegradation experiments showed that it was less bioreactive than protein-like DOM that accounted for -30% of total fluorescence. This observation indicates fluorescent DOM (FDOM) was controlled primarily by soil inputs and not substantially influenced by instream production and processing, suggesting that the bulk of FDOM in these streams is transported to downstream environments with limited in situ modification. Linear regression and redundancy analysis models identified that the seasonal variations in DOM were dictated primarily by hydrology and temperature. Overall, high discharge and shallow flow paths led to the enrichment of less-degraded DOM with higher percentages of microbial humic-like and tyrosine-like compounds, whereas high temperatures favored the accumulation of high-aromaticity, high-molecular-weight, terrestrial, humic-like compounds in stream water. The flux of DOC and four fluorescence components was driven primarily by water discharge. Thus, the instantaneous exports of both refractory humic-like DOM and reactive protein-like DOM were higher in wetter seasons (winter and spring). As high temperatures and severe precipitation are projected to become more prominent in the southeastern U.S. due to climate change, our findings have important implications for future changes in the amount, source, and composition of DOM in Coastal Plain streams and the associated impacts on downstream carbon and nutrient supplies and water quality.

They are also sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and are globally threatened. Understanding how flow regime drives the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland habitats is fundamental to effective conservation practices. In this study, using Landsat imagery and the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, we mapped the winter distribution of four wetland habitats (i.e., Carex meadow, reedbed, mudflat, and shallow water) in East Dongting Lake, a Ramsar wetland in the middle to lower Yangtze Basin of China, for 34 years (1988-2021). The dynamics of wetland habitats were explored through pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Further, the response of wetland habitats to flow regime variations was investigated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). Our results demonstrated the constant expansion of reedbeds and shrinkage of mudflats, and that there were three processes contributing to the reduction in mudflat: (1) permanent replacement by reedbed; (2) irreversible loss to water; and (3) transitional swapping with Carex meadow. These changes in the relative extent of wetland habitats may degrade the conservation function of the Ramsar wetland. Moreover, the duration of the dry season and the date of water level withdrawal were identified as the key flow regime parameters shaping the size of wetland habitats. However, different wetland vegetation showed distinct responses to variations in flow regime: while Carex meadow increased with earlier water withdrawal and a longer dry season, reedbed continuously expanded independent of the flow regime corresponding to the increase in winter rainfall. Our findings suggested that flow regime acts in concert with other factors, such as climate change and sand mining in river channels, driving wetland habitat transition in a floodplain landscape. Therefore, effective conservation can only be achieved through diverse restoration strategies addressing all drivers.

ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						African grasses; Aquatic grasses; Biological invasion; Global warming; Species distribution modeling; Wetlands	ECHINOCHLOA-POLYSTACHYA; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; PLANT DIVERSITY; FUTURE; IMPACT; CONSERVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MACROPHYTE; DYNAMICS; CERRADO	Several anthropic disturbances, including deforestation, fires, the building of roads and dams, have intensified in Amazon in last decades. These disturbances contribute to an increase in the occurrence and intensity of extreme events, such as more frequent floods and more severe droughts, due to climate change. Along the Amazonian rivers, aquatic herbaceous plants, mainly of the Poaceae family, are very abundant and produce up to three times more biomass than the adjacent flooded forests, and some are considered ecosystem engineers given their structuring role in these environments. Invasive grasses have spread through the Neotropics and are gradually entering the Amazon via the Arc of Deforestation. These invasive species often attain high coverage, suppress other species, and become dominant in both disturbed and pristine habitats. The aim of this study was to establish the current and future distribution patterns of two native ecosystem engineer species (Echinochloa polystachya and Paspalum fasciculatum) and two invasive species (Urochloa brizantha and Urochloa decumbens) in the Amazon Basin. To predict the future climate, we used three scenarios, namely SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 for the years 2040, 2080 and 2100, to project climatically suitable areas. The current climatically suitable range for the native ecosystem engineer species was estimated at 33-35% of the Amazon Basin, while the invasive ones have a range of 53-84% in potential climatically suitable areas. A decrease in the areas of suit-ability of the two ecosystem engineer species, E. polystachya and P. fasciculatum, was observed in all scenarios and years, while only the invasive U. brizantha showed an increase in suitable areas in all years. These results raise concerns about the invasion of grasses with high aggressive potential that could result in the exclusion of native ecosystem engineer species and their ecological roles.

Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal rainfall variation and its causes at meso and micro-level could provide insight for the water and agricultural development interventions. This article examines the spatio-temporal rainfall variability and driving factors in connection with large scale global oscillation. CHIRPS rainfall and NCEP/NCAR wind fields data from 1981 to 2019 were used. Rotaed Emperical Ortogonal Function (REOF) was employed to investigate spatio-temporal rainfall variability. Large scale moisture transport was studied using lower (1000-850 hPa), middle (600-500 hpa), and upper (300-100 hPa) level wind fields. The result reveals that in South Sudan rainfall dominant variance regions were not uniform across seasons. Northern, Southcentral, and Southeastern tip re-gions were the top three dominant variance regions which explain around 30 %, 25 % and 17 % of the total variation in REOF1, REOF2, and REOF3 during the spring season respectively. Likewise, during the summer season the dominant variance REOF1 (28 %), REOF2 (24 %), and REOF3 (9 %) was observed in South-east, West, and, North-west, whereas; the autumn dominant variance in North-west, North-east, and South-east explain about REOF1 (22.6 %), REOF2 (19.9 %), and REOF3 (16.7 %) of the total variation respectively. The alternative wet and dry years were causing drought and flooding in the study sites. Low-level southeasterly winds from India and over the equator from the Atlantic Ocean carry rain-bearing moisture to South Sudan. The winds converge and convection is triggered by African Easterly and Tropical Easterly jet favors convection during the summer and spring seasons. Sea Surface temperature shows a positive and negative correlation with rainfall variability. Rainfall spatio-temporal assessment is crucial for water resource management, agricultural productivity, and climate change mitigation.

Three key functional components: adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure; incorporating six parameters: demographic, political, economic, social, physical, and environmental and 36 indicators have been used to create the Vulnerability Index (VI). Data is utilised from 253 household surveys, focus groups, semi-structured in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Composite indices and differential vulnerabilities are presented and compared, demonstrating that Cumilla is less vulnerable to disruption caused by socio-economic, political and environmental change, has a higher adaptive capacity, and is less vulnerable overall than Dhaka. Unlike Dhaka, Cumilla suffers from fewer socio-economic disadvantages such as traffic congestion, crime, unemployment, and water access issues. In terms of exposure to adverse environmental events and trends, Dhaka suffers more flooding, waterlogging, air and water pollution, and higher annual temperature and temperature variability and lower monsoon rainfall and monsoon rainfall variability than Cumilla. The results suggest Cumilla could be a more migrant-friendly destination for poor migrants than Dhaka. This paper investigates the stresses and societal crisis in mega-cities, and contributes to devising plans to mitigate them. These findings are of increasing importance in a situation of increasing climate change and migratory flows caused in part by climate change. Overall, the results of this study could contribute to understanding the challenges faced by mega-cities with similar climatic, socioeconomic, urban, and vulnerability conditions, in which 1 billion people currently reside.

Affected by heavy rainfall and an El Nino event, a destructive flood occurred in Anhui province, China on 18th June 2016. This study investigates the impact of this severe flood on infectious diarrhea at both city-level and provincial level, and further to identify modifying factor. We obtained information on infectious diarrheal cases during 2013-2017 from the National Disease Surveillance System. An interrupted time-series design was used to estimate effects of the flood event on diarrhea in 16 cities. Then we applied a meta-analysis to estimate the area-level pooled effects of the flood in both flooded areas and non-flooded areas. Finally, a meta-regression was applied to determine whether proximity to flood was a predictor of city-level risks. Stratified analyses by gender and age group were also conducted for flooded areas. A significant increase in infectious diarrhea risk (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.23) after the flood event was found in flooded area with variation in risks across cities, while there was no increase in non-flooded areas. Diarrheal risks post-flood was progressively higher in cities with greater proximity to the Yangtze River. Children aged 5-14 were at highest risk of diarrhea post-flood in the flooded areas. Our study provides strong evidence that the 2016 severe flood significantly increased infectious diarrheal risk in exposed populations. Local public health agencies are advised to develop intervention programs to prevent and control infectious diarrhea risk when a major flood occurs, especially in areas close to water bodies and among vulnerable populations.

AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						abundance; decline; erect-crested penguins; Eudyptes filholi; Eudyptes sclateri; landslides; rockhopper penguins; storm events	EUDYPTES-C.-CHRYSOCOME; SOUTHERN ROCKHOPPER; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES; BIOLOGY	Worldwide, most crested penguin species (Eudyptes spp.) are in decline. New Zealand's subantarctic Antipodes Islands are of international significance for erect-crested (Eudyptes sclateri) and rockhopper (Eudyptes filholi) penguins. Between 1995 and 2011, a 23% decline was recorded in the two penguin species on the Antipodes Islands. In October 2014, nest abundance counts on Antipodes Island were undertaken to determine if this decline was continuing, particularly in light of a significant storm event that hit the Antipodes area in January 2014 causing massive landslides during the penguin breeding season. All penguin colonies ground counted in 2011 were preferentially ground counted in 2014 or, if time or weather did not allow, were checked with binoculars to confirm colony presence or absence. Seventy-three per cent of the colonies and the equivalent of 82% of all nests counted in 2011 were recounted in 2014. Overall, there was a 19% decline in erect-crested penguin nests between 2011 and 2014. Rockhopper penguins showed a slight increase (2.6%). Landslides affected 11% of the main islands' land area and 44% of surveyed nesting colonies. Erect-crested penguin colonies with approximately 75% or greater of their area impacted by landslides showed a significantly greater decline than unaffected or only partially impacted colonies. Landslides showed a minimal effect on rockhopper nest numbers. There continues to be a significant decline of erect-crested penguins at the Antipodes Islands. An increasing occurrence of extreme weather events are predicted with climate change and have the potential to increase land-based flooding and landslides, adding additional impacts to terrestrial breeding marine species. Greater understanding of what is causing erect-crested penguin decline is needed to prevent this endangered species from extinction.	[Chilvers, B.

SWATCH21: A project for linking eco-hydrologic processes and services to aquatic biodiversity at river and catchment levels	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Biodiversity; Tradeoffs and synergies; Modeling; Climate change; Landuse change	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL; GENERALIZED REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; LAND-USE CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL DATA; BETA DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; RESOURCES	The objective of the SWATCH21 project is to improve our understanding of eco-hydrologic services at the catchment level, and biodiversity at the river scale. Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

While there are many methods of evaluating investments in disaster risk reduction, most methods are based on losses and benefits to the entire region, and the differences in the benefits for different social classes are unclear. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the impact on the poor, who are particularly severely affected by disasters. Here, we present a method for assessing the impact of disaster risk reduction investments on the poor based on case study data from Bago, Myanmar, including interviews with 440 households. The results show that by considering the development of the poor, the benefits of investment in disaster risk reduction can increase by similar to 4.4 times. Although there is uncertainty in modeling such a complex system, the results demonstrate the need to consider both the direct and indirect impacts of disaster risk reduction investments, for facilitating sustainable development in developing countries.

J	Gregory, K; Grant-Smith, D				Gregory, Kieran; Grant-Smith, Deanna			Engaging recreational fishers in fisheries' stewardship: a case of responsibilisation in natural resource management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Australia; recreational fishers; anglers; habitat rehabilitation; aquatic stewardship	MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATIVE-FISH; PARTICIPATION; HEALTH; POLICY; COPRODUCTION; MOTIVATIONS; FLOODPLAINS; GOVERNANCE	Neoliberal thought has exerted significant influence over the crafting and delivery of environmental policy. This has manifested in enlisting non-state actors to advance environmental policy agendas in ways that were previously the responsibility of the state. The participation of these non-state actors is positioned as integral to solving intractable environmental challenges, such as the degradation of fish habitat. Drawing on responsibilisation as a technique of governance, this research adopts a case-based study of fisheries rehabilitation policy to explore how recreationists are being mobilized to address environmental problems. Deploying interpretive policy analysis to analyze key policy artifacts this research highlights how fishers as recreational users of aquatic areas are constituted as moral, political and authoritative actors who bear responsibility for ameliorating degraded fish habitats, despite the impacts of recreational fishing on these habitats being contested. We conclude by identifying the implications of this responsibilisation for the implementation of co-management and shared stewardship of fisheries resources.

The Ecology of Disturbance Interactions	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						biological legacies; cumulative effects; disturbance cascades; disturbance regime; extreme events	LARGE-SCALE DISTURBANCES; PINE-BEETLE OUTBREAKS; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; LODGEPOLE PINE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CYCLIC SUCCESSION; TREE REGENERATION; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CORAL-REEFS; MULTIPLE DISTURBANCES	Global change has been accompanied by recent increases in the frequency and intensity of various ecological disturbances (e.g., fires, floods, cyclones), both natural and anthropogenic in origin. Because these disturbances often interact, their cumulative and synergistic effects can result in unforeseen consequences, such as insect outbreaks, crop failure, and progressive ecosystem degradation. We consider the roles of biological legacies, thresholds, and lag effects responsible for the distinctive impacts of interacting disturbances. We propose a hierarchical classification that distinguishes the patterns and implications associated with random co-occurrences, individual links, and multiple links among disturbances that cascade in chains or networks. Disturbance-promoting interactions apparently prevail over disturbance-inhibiting ones. Complex and exogenous disturbance cascades are less predictable than simple and endogenous links because of their dependency on adjacent or synchronous events. These distinctions help define regional disturbance regimes and can have implications for natural selection, risk assessment, and options for management intervention.
